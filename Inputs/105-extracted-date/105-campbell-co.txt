Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to may good friend and colleague from Colorado, Congressman Dan Schaefer. 
Congressman Dan Schaefer is retiring from the House of Representatives after 15 years of service to the people of Colorado's 6th Congressional District and the United States. I would like to take this opportunity to share a few reflections on Dan Schaefer's many accomplishments as a Congressman. 
Not only did Congressman Dan Schaefer ably step into the void left when Congressman Jack Swigert died shortly after being elected, but he also successfully led the charge in Congress to have a statute depicting Jack Swigert as a young and daring astronaut of Apollo XIII fame added to Congress' statuary collection as Colorado's second and final contribution. With its wonderful combination of bronze and a colorful space suit, the statue is both visually striking and proud. The Jack Swigert statue is perhaps one of the most popular in the halls of Congress for visitors from all over the world. I know it is one of mine. 
Over the years Congressman Dan Schaefer has been a leader in the fight to balance our nation's budget. In fact, Dan Schaefer is the one who introduced H.J. Res. 1, a joint resolution calling for an amendment to the Constitution to provide for a balanced budget for the U.S. federal government and for greater accountability in the enactment of tax legislation in the 105th Congress. H.J. Res. 1 clearly merits the cosponsorships of the 229 of his colleagues in the House of Representatives who joined in support of Congressman Schaefer's resolution. 
I am an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 1, the companion legislation in the Senate to H.J. Res. 1. While this worthy legislation fell just one vote short of passage in the Senate in the 105th Congress, this Congress also just passed the first balanced budget in many, many years. Dan Schaefer is retiring from Congress with its books balanced for the first time in generations. His role in achieving this important historic victory for the American people will be remembered. 
Congressman Dan Schaefer has also been a national leader in energy issues. In the 105th Congress he led the drive for Public Law 105-28, a law that amends and updates sections of the Department of Energy Organization Act. He has also been a ground breaker in the quest to deregulate American electricity. Even the exceeding complexities and deep vested interests involved in our nation's electricity markets and monopolies did not deter Dan Schaefer from introducing H.R. 655. This bill's goal was to give all American consumers the right to choose among competitive providers of electricity in order to achieve lower prices and better service. His steadfast work on this complex issue has made valuable progress that can be built upon in years to come. 
Finally, as the Coach of the Republican Congressional Baseball Team, Dan Schaefer has established a winning record, batting 60% as the Republican team has won 3 out of 5 games under his leadership, including winning for the last two years, in 1997 and 1998. Dan has also been selected as the team's Most Valuable Player twice. It is clear that Congressman Schaefer's leadership will be missed both in the halls of Congress as well as on the Congressional baseball diamond. 
As he retires from the House, Congressman Dan Schaefer has a record of accomplishment to be proud of. He is the undisputed Dean of the Colorado delegation. He will be missed. I wish him well and best of luck in all of his future endeavors.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague from Iowa for raising this issue. The Senator from Iowa is correct that the conferees did not include a specific increase in funding for the individual HIDTA's. However, it is my hope that the Office of National Drug Control Policy will use these extra resources to fund an increase in those HIDTA's which demonstrates the greatest need. Consideration should be given to those HIDTA's cited in the amendment described by the Senator from Iowa.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Agency Compliance Act. This legislation is the redraft of prior legislation that I introduced, S. 1166, the Federal Agency Compliance Act, which was the subject of a hearing on June 15, 1998 before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, chaired by Senator Grassley. 
At the June 15 hearing, Lynn Conforti from Denver, CO, testified on behalf of the thousands of Social Security disability claimants, who are denied their claims not on the basis of Federal circuit court opinions but on the basis of agency policy that is contrary to Federal law. In November 1996, Ms. Conforti was forced to quit work because of severe pain due to failed surgery on her back to correct corvature of the spine, scoliosis. Until that time. Ms. Conforti had been employed her entire life since she was 19 years old and paid her FICA taxes into the Social Security Disability Program for 27 years. At the hearing, she described her 32-month struggle with the Social Security Administration that had twice denied her benefits, because they did not give due weight to the medical opinion of her treating physicians or the severity of her pain, contrary to Federal court decisions. Ms. Conforti described her physical ordeal, having two back surgeries, removing 10 discs, two sets of surgical rods and screws, 38 days in the hospital, 334 physical therapy visits, 128 physician visits, and 16 months of chronic pain. Despite her disability, Ms. Conforti hopes to be able to return to work in the future, but she needs the disability resources to continue rehabilitation efforts. 
Finally, in July 1998, Ms. Conforti was awarded her disability benefits by an administrative law judge (ALJ) in an on-the-record determination. The ALJ, unlike lower level decisionmakers at SSA, was able to apply Federal court decisions to her case. For this reason, the bill I am introducing today contains a provision included in a similar bill, H.R. 1544, that states that agency employees and ALJ's shall adhere to court of appeals precedent within the circuit, insuring that Ms. Conforti and thousands of other claimants will no longer be victims of agency intracircuit nonacquiescence with the passage of this legislation. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin, for their support for this important legislation and for their assistance in revising the legislation that I introduce today. Through the effort of Senator Sessions, the bill clarifies that adherence by agencies to court of appeals precedent shall be in civil cases and there is no prohibition on an agency relitigating a matter in more than three circuits if such relitigation is necessary. Also, Senator Durbin clarified that certain agencies, such as the National Labor Relations Board [NLRB], are not bound by adherence to court of appeals precedent when it is not certain that the court of appeals that established the NLRB precedent has exclusive jurisdiction over the matter or by another circuit. Again, I want to thank my colleagues for these clariications and for their support of the bill I introduce today. 
Intracircuit agency nonacquiescence to appellate precedent is not limited to the Social Security Administration, which was described at our hearing, but has been a long-term problem with all agencies and one that the Congress has struggled with since the early 1980's. Finally, we have a consensus on legislation that will solve this problem and return us to the rule of law that we expect and that citizens deserve. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to ensure Federal agencies follow the law.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I take this opportunity to call my colleagues' attention to the role of women owned businesses in our economy, and particularly in Colorado. The Business Women's Network (BWN), which is a network of 1200 women's associations working in concert to expand all women's inclusion in business development, is helping towards that end. Tonight, the BWN will be hosting an event to honor its members and the many structures which serve the development of women's business. 
Colorado enterprises which embody well-developed and successful business ventures include: the Colorado Women's Business Office, which represents more than 75,000 women and 50,000 girls; the Denver Women's Business Network; the Casa Career Development and Business Center for Women; the Southern Colorado Women's Chamber of Commerce; the University of Colorado Women's Resource Center; the Women Owner, Managers and Executive Network of Colorado Springs; the Women's Foundation of Colorado; the Women's Library Association in Denver, and many others. Colorado's success in identifying and nurturing a strong base of women owned businesses provides a model for other states seeking to conquer the spectrum of needs and obstacles that confront women entrepreneurs. 
National recognition is in order. Last year, the women-owned businesses in the Denver metro area had the highest regional growth rate in the country, at 57%. Both employment and sales increased four-fold. The translation for Coloradans is easy. As a state, we enjoy more than 77,600 women-owned businesses that provide jobs for almost 208,000 people, to the tune of $23 billion in annual sales. 
The Business Women's Network is important because it profiles all women's groups, both nationally and globally, in salute of their achievements. Today, I wish to single out for special honor the solid foothold women's business has in Colorado's unparalleled economy. I also want to encourage the continued efforts of BWN--the strong presence of women in our world economy cannot be emphasized enough.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Today I express my appreciation to the majority leader, Senator Ford, Senator Gorton, and Senator McCain for their hard work and efforts on S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act. I believe S. 852 will deter automobile theft and protect consumers by providing them with notice of severely damaged vehicles. I would like to emphasize one provision contained in the bill. It is my understanding that the process of reducing salvage and nonrepairable vehicles to parts cannot begin before receipt of a salvage title, nonrepairable vehicle certificate, or other appropriate ownership documentation under state law. If a vehicle could be dismantled prior to the receipt of the appropriate ownership documents, then the parts from a severely damaged vehicle could skirt the titling system which this bill has put in place to deter automobile theft. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the majority leader. Whether this bill is pulled down or proceeds is yet to be determined. I would like to make a few comments about the bill. Senator Kohl and I, as well as our staffs, worked very hard on this bill. It seemed like the longer it hung out there the more lightning it drew. I want comment on a few provisions in it. 
This report provides funding for the Department of Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent agencies, as our colleagues know. 
Although this has not been an easy bill to complete, because of the funding constraints as well as controversial issues, I think we did as good a job as we could, accommodating as many requests as we could from our colleagues. The most difficult issues for the conferees were not about money, but about legislative riders to this appropriations bill. There were some very strong opinions on both sides on these riders and that did end up stalling the bill. 
But I am concerned about one article. As I mentioned, during the heat of the debate, there were some strong opinions. I was concerned about an article appearing in the October 7 Hill that implied the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, was blocking the bill because it contained language to name a post office building in St. Paul for former Senator Eugene McCarthy. For the Record, I want to say that is absolutely not true. At no time, did she ever disagree with this bill, and in fact that language is in the bill. I wanted to make that part of the Record. 
The ranking member of our subcommittee, Senator Kohl, and I continued to place greater emphasis on treasury law enforcement, which is a central focus of this bill, and tried to ensure that agents and inspectors have the tools to do their job. I certainly appreciate Senator Kohl's support and hard work. 
There is much in this conference report that deserves the support of the Senate: 
$128 million for the IRS customer service initiative, and to restructure and reform their long overdue operation. 
$2 million for low-income taxpayers clinic. 
$2.4 million to double the staffing for the cyber-smuggling unit at the Customs Service to stop child pornography, plus an additional $1 million for technology to assist in this effort. 
$13 million for grants to state and local law enforcement for gang resistance education and training programs, called GREAT programs--$3 million more than the President actually had requested. 
$6 million to allow eligible State and local law enforcement to acquire ballistics identification and comparison computer systems for both bullets and cartridge cases. 
There is another $27 million to continue and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to help stop gun trafficking to our youth. 
There is $182 million for the high-intensity drug trafficking areas, known as HIDTAs, and $13 million to continue the program to transfer technology to State and local law enforcement. 
Courthouse construction projects, as well as repair and alterations of current Federal facilities, were also included. 
There is $185 million for a second year of a very successful antidrug youth media campaign that was administered by the drug czar. 
All in all, Mr. President, I think it is a good bill. We worked very hard. 
I am just here to say I am sorry that some of these rather divisive riders that ended up being on the bill ended up making it so controversial. But the underlying fact of the bill, the mission of the bill, has great intentions. It is a good bill. 
I just wanted to again thank Senator Kohl for all of his work on it. I hope we proceed forward with it. I am realistic enough to know that it is in trouble. 
With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Majority Leader and my colleague from Alabama for his leadership on this issue. The gentleman is correct. The language included in the Conference Report will require Federal agencies to make all Federally funded research data available to the public through procedures established by the Freedom of Information Act. The Conferees recognize that this language covers research data not currently covered by the Freedom of Information Act. The provision applies to all Federally funded research data regardless of whether the awarding agency has the data at the time the request is made. If the awarding agency must obtain the data from the recipient of the award, the provision specifically states that the awarding agency may authorize a reasonable user fee equaling the incremental cost of obtaining the data. It is my expectation that the Director of OMB to make the required changes within 90 days of enactment and that awarding agencies to issue new regulations implementing the amended Circular within one year of enactment. As is true with the existing OMB Circular A-110, the amended Circular shall apply to all Federally funded research, regardless of the level of funding or whether the award recipient is also using non-Federal funds. I want to thank my colleague from Alabama for his leadership on this important issue and his efforts to safeguard the public's right to know.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to take a few moments to let my colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives know about the progress we have made in promoting Honesty in Sweepstakes during the 105th Congress. 
Over the past month, the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1998, S. 2141, made excellent progress as it was refined and polished. These refinements reflect the valuable input I received from witness testimony and my fellow Senators during a Governmental Affairs Subcommittee hearing on S. 2141. The newest Honesty in Sweepstakes language also reflects the results of numerous productive discussions and negotiations with interested parties, including the Postal Service, the industry, the AARP and consumer protection groups. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Thompson and Senator Cochran, who as the respective Chairmen of the Governmental Affairs Committee and the International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services Subcommittee, have been helpful and gracious in their efforts to help me move this sweepstakes reform legislation during the 105th Congress. I also want to thank my good friend, Senator Collins, who cosponsored my original Honesty in Sweepstakes bill and provided valuable input that is reflected in the new language I am talking about today. 
This revised Honesty in Sweepstakes legislation would go a long way toward protecting our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers from misleading and deceptive sweepstakes promotions. This is something we should do this year to protect consumers. I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation before the 105th Congress concludes.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, Tuesday, October 6, 1998, will always hold a spot dear to my heart. I hope that today will also be dear to the hearts of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people, dear to Coloradans, and dear to Americans everywhere. 
Today, S. 1695, the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Study Act of 1998, a bill I was proud to introduce, was signed into law at a special White House ceremony. Under this new law, our nation takes a major step toward honoring the memory of the many innocent Cheyenne and Arapahoe people massacred there by instructing the National Park Service to locate the site of the Sand Creek Massacre once and for all. 
Somewhere along the banks of Sand Creek in Southeastern Colorado is a killing field where many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho, many of my ancestors, fell on the cold morning of November 29, 1864. On that day, in the month known by the Cheyenne and Arapaho people as the Month of the Freezing Moon, this ground was sanctified when the blood of hundreds of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children and elderly noncombatants was needlessly and brutally spilt. 
Once this sacred ground is located, I hope it will be acquired and preserved with honor and dignity and in a way that takes into account the concerns of the Cheyenne and Arapaho decedents of those who died there. This ground should also be open to all people as a reminder of the national tragedy that occurred at Sand Creek. 
On this special day, I would like to take a moment to thank a few people who helped S. 1695 become law. I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, Congressman Bob Schaffer, who introduced the companion bill and shepherded this legislation through the House of Representatives. I also want to thank Senator Craig Thomas, who as the Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, was gracious and helpful in getting this bill through the Senate. 
I especially want to thank my friends William Walksalong, Steve Brady and Laird Cometsevah, who all spoke with such eloquence as witnesses during the March 24th, 1998, hearing on S. 1695, that many in the room, including myself, were deeply moved. I also want to thank LaForce Lonebear who sent in his testimony even though he could not attend the hearing. Finally, I want to thank David Halaas of the Colorado State Historical Society and Roger Walke of the Congressional Research Service for their dedication along the way. 
Many of these and other friends joined me at the White House earlier today as S. 1695 was signed into law. 
Finally, on this occasion I want to pay a long overdue tribute to one young Coloradan, Captain Silas S. Soule, whose actions over one hundred and thirty years ago saved many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho lives on that fateful day at Sand Creek. 
When Captain Soule, who was under Colonel Chivington's command, heard of Chivington's plan to attack a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho winter encampment at Sand Creek, he vigorously tried to persuade Chivington to abandon the plan. However, Colonel Chivington, who was known to say `Nits make Lice' as a justification for killing innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho women and children, could not be dissuaded. 
When Chivington ordered his men to attack the peaceful Sand Creek encampment, the vast majority of which were women, children, and elderly noncombatants, Captain Soule steadfastly refused to order his Company to open fire. Captain Soule's refusal allowed many, perhaps hundreds, of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho to flee the bloody killing field through his Company's line. 
While the Sand Creek Massacre was at first hailed as a great victory, Captain Soule was determined to make the horrific truth of the massacre known. Even though he was jailed, intimidated, threatened, and even shot at, Soule refused to compromise himself and made his voice heard through reports that reached all the way from Colorado to Washington, and even to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Even with the bloody carnage of the Civil War, the brutal atrocities at Sand Creek shocked the nation. 
During hearings in Denver, Captain Soule's integrity and unwavering testimony turned the tide against the once popular Chivington and the other men who participated in the massacre and mutilations at Sand Creek. Captain Soule fully realized that telling the truth about the massacre could cost him his life, even telling a good friend that he fully expected to be killed for his testimony. He was right. Walking home with his new bride a short time later, Silas Soule was ambushed and shot in the head by an assassin who had participated in the Sand Creek Massacre. Silas Soule's funeral, held just a few weeks after his wedding, was one of the most attended in Denver up until that time. 
While Captain Silas Soule's name has largely faded into history, he stands out as one of the few bright rays of light in the moral darkness that surrounds the Sand Creek Massacre. He should be remembered. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as I cast my vote in favor of final passage of the Federal Aviation Administration's Reauthorization bill, S.2279, I am pleased to bring attention to one special amendment to this bill. 
The amendment which my colleague Senator Allard and I offered will make the FAA's temporary ban on commercial tour overflights permanent. I have been working toward permanently banning commercial tour overflights over Rocky Mountain National Park for many years now, and am pleased to see this provision pass the Senate. 
As I cast my vote today, Coloradans will be one big step closer to being assured that they will be able to enjoy the scenic beauty of Rocky Mountain National Park without the noisy disturbances of commercial tour overflights. 
At this time I want to thank Senator McCain, who as the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, played a critical role in getting this amendment successfully included in the FAA bill.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi amendment on Indian gaming. I think it is patently unfair because it will result in preventing Indian tribes from engaging in business activities that are now enjoyed by non-Indian 
neighbors. If we are going to talk about the merits of gambling--and I noticed my friend from Wyoming spoke eloquently about the down side of gambling--maybe we ought to shut down Reno and Las Vegas so millions, hundreds of millions of Americans cannot go there because it is bad for their health or sight or something. 
We are not here, by the way, Mr. President, to defend the actions of the Secretary of Interior, and I hope we will not confuse that. His mismanagement is one thing, but the letter of the law is something else. And I firmly believe you can't fix an otherwise good bill, this Interior appropriations bill, with a bad amendment. This simply makes a good bill bad. 
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 was a compromise to give State governments a voice in what kind of gaming would occur on Indian reservations within a State's borders. This was an unusual break from Federal Indian policy because States have no constitutional role in negotiating with Indian tribes, as you know. 
I was here in 1988, in fact, and helped write that original authorizing legislation, IGRA, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. There was no intent at the time to usurp State laws, but as with many laws we have passed, there have been unintended consequences. The way it was written, a State can prevent a tribe from operating gaming facilities on its reservation simply by refusing to negotiate with the tribe. And that, of course, was upheld in the Seminole decision. My friend from Wyoming has spoken to that. 
But in 1988, it didn't occur to us, when we were writing the bill, that States might simply refuse to negotiate in good faith. Since tribes are limited to those types of gaming allowed under State law, we have tribes prohibited from being in the same business as their non-Indian neighbors. I think that is discriminatory in the least. It is wrong to do that, and I think it violates the treaties. I should also point out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian gaming is promoted and even operated by State governments. They certainly don't want the competition. 
Since Congress' intent under IGRA was that States should not have the ability to unilaterally veto gaming on Indian land, the Department of Interior has proposed regulations to address this situation. Although the proposal may need refinement, we do not believe the Secretary should be precluded from at least developing and proposing alternative approaches to State-tribal impasses in the gaming negotiations. In fact, in a letter issued on September 9, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has stated the Enzi amendment could be very harmful in their ongoing negotiations. 
Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anybody of States rights, but those who say this new procedure overrides the States are simply wrong. Under the draft proposal, if a State objected to a decision made by the Interior Secretary, that State could challenge that decision in Federal court. For those who claim the Interior Department is acting without legislative oversight, I would point out that Congress will have the authority to review any proposed regulations before they take effect. As those proposed regulations come before the authorizing committees, any new gaming regulations will get a careful review, and if, after input from the rest of the Senate, those regulations are found to be unacceptable, they simply will not pass. We will legislate a new approach if they do not pass. 
I understand that there are Members in the Chamber who are simply against gaming. That is not what this debate is about. Under Federal law, tribes are limited to the types of gaming allowed under the laws of the State in which they reside. In my own State of Colorado as an example, there are two tribes, the Southern Ute and the Ute Mountain Ute. They are limited to slot machines and low-stakes table games, just as the other gaming towns in Colorado. In Utah, State law prohibits all gaming. Therefore, no tribes can do any kind of gaming whatsoever, and the tribes in other States cannot do gaming if a State law prevents that. 
Contrary to the statement already made that there have been no hearings, we have done hearings. We simply have not gotten to the important part of the legislation, which is a markup, but we will. This debate is about whether a Governor of a State can limit a type of business activity to certain ethnic groups. That is unfair and un-American. Let's not jeopardize a good bill with a bad amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Enzi amendment and allow the regulatory and legislative process to work. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.  
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I add my voice to the on-going debate on the campaign finance reform bill that is before us once again. Let me say right up front, so that there is no confusion, I support, and I have always supported enforceable, reasonable, common-sense reform. Unfortunately, I don't believe the amendment offered by Senators McCain and Feingold before the Senate meets those standards, nor do I believe it would stand a Constitutional challenge. As I stated with my friend and fellow Coloradan, Senator Allard, in a joint editorial printed in the Denver Post back in October, `real campaign finance reform protects the right to free speech under the First Amendment while guaranteeing the public's right to know through full disclosure.' This amendment does not contain that kind of reform. The Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to freedom of speech and association in the First Amendment. 
The Supreme Court applied those words to campaign spending in the landmark case Buckley v. Valeo to mean that money spent in favor or against a candidate is a form of speech, and therefore entitled to this protection. That decision has been reinforced over and over again. Given this ruling, I cannot believe that the Court, or the Founding Fathers, intended to impose a sixty- or thirty-day moratorium prior to elections on this right, as this amendment would do. I believe the Founders wanted Americans to have the unabridged right to speak their minds and show their support for candidates by using a collective voice, including showing support by making contributions to one candidate or another. 
In order to have an educated electorate, money must be spent on spreading candidates' messages. In our free market system, advertising rates are determined by the industry. I would note that these days, there is hardly such a thing as a `free exchange of ideas,' as nearly all forms of communication cost money. The exchange of ideas and opinions is what allows the public to become informed about the candidates that are seeking office. But limiting the amount candidates can raise and spend severely limits the ability to spread information about their backgrounds and opinions, and only harms citizens. I cannot understand why this amendment targets some forms of spreading these messages while allowing others to continue unchecked. Doesn't that signal to the American people that the First Amendment only applies to speech that is printed, and not speech that is broadcast? 
I would note that my colleagues and I have been under tremendous pressure this session to pass this particular legislation. But until we have found a solution that answers all the Constitutional concerns that have been raised, I am reluctant to act on this particular measure. As was stated in an editorial that appeared in my state's Rocky Mountain News, this `particular piece of legislation would have betrayed several of the nation's most important principles, not the least of all is its guarantee of free political speech.' I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the National Jewish Medical Research Center in Denver, Colorado, which has recently been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as the top-ranked Respiratory Hospital in the United States. The work of National Jewish is close to my heart because I watched my mother struggle with tuberculosis throughout her lifetime. She lived and worked in a sanatorium for many years, making it difficult for her to care for my sister and me. 
In the late 1800s, Denver's elevation and abundant sunshine made it a mecca for people with tuberculosis. National Jewish treated only patients with tuberculosis until the 1950s, when antibiotics brought the disease under control. The hospital then turned its attention to asthma. Allergies which can develop into asthma, bronchitis, and sinus infections, now attack some 40 million people, double the number 25 years ago. Twice as many people, 15 million, have asthma now, too, at a cost of $6.2 billion a year in missed work and school, in medications and hospital visits. 
Today, National Jewish is a world-class institution, a global leader in the research and treatment of lung, allergic and immune diseases. It is ranked as the number one private institution for immunology research in the world and as one of the top 10 independent research institutions of any kind in the world. Tremendous breakthroughs in understanding respiratory disease are taking place in Denver. 
Not only is National Jewish recognized world-wide for its research, it is also known for its considerable philanthropic activities in the health care community. Until the mid-1960s, patient care was funded entirely through philanthropy. Today, the hospital continues to provide a significant amount of free and subsidized care to those unable to afford total treatment costs. 
Founded in 1899 as a nonsectarian, non-profit hospital for tuberculosis patients, National Jewish enters the 21st century as the only facility in the world dedicated exclusively to pulmonary disorders. It is one of Colorado's treasures. Next year it will celebrate its 100th year of giving health and hope to people suffering from pulmonary diseases. 
Today, I want to commend National Jewish on the rich history of patient care and research given to Colorado, to congratulate them on being recognized as the top-ranked Respiratory Hospital in America, and to wish them well as they celebrate the 100th anniversary in 1999.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak about one aspect of the Statement of Administration Policy on this bill. Specifically, the section referring to the Customs Automation Enhancement Account. 
The SAP makes it appear that the Committee neither funded nor considered the Administration's request for this program. In fact, we fully funded the request, which was $8 million. When the budget was submitted, it included authorizing legislation on a Merchandise Processing Fee, which would net $56 million for this program. This is not within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee and if the authorizers were not going to act in sufficient time, the Administration should have sent up a budget amendment to cover the cost of the program so that it could be considered by the Committee. That did not happen, this committee never received a formal request to increase the funding for this program. If we had, we would have given it consideration. I just wanted to let my colleagues know that we fully funded this program and would have considered the request to increase it, but we never received anything upon which to act. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before asking for the yeas and nays, I would like to say a few words in closing about S. 2312. 
As many of you may have noticed, this bill has not been an easy one to craft to stay within our funding constraints. We started on this bill before the August break and we are still at it. I believe in some instances, we have probably had to rob Peter to pay Paul because this bill carries programs which are all worthy and all important to everyone in this Nation. 
We have had to make some difficult choices between the programs in the bill and it has been easy to do because the goal is to emerge with an acceptable balance while still doing the right thing and staying within our funding limits. 
I believe though, however, we can honestly say we have done our very best to accommodate everyone's wishes and everyone's requests, even though it has not been easy. 
As always, the ranking member, Senator Kohl, has been great to work with, and without him, we could not have completed this bill. So I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. 
I want him to know that his friendship and professional efforts and courtesy have meant a great deal to me. 
In addition, I would like to take a moment to thank his staff--Barbara Retzlaff, who has been so diligent working on this bill the entire year, as well as Paul Bock and Liz Blevins for their support on the floor during our consideration. And I also thank our staff--Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin and Lula Edwards, who spent a lot of evenings, long evenings at that, trying to make sure the bill came out the way we wanted it to. 
In spite of our difficulties, I believe that we have put forth a good bill which deserves the support of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.  
Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that seeks to extend the legislative authority for the construction of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial and for the Foundation raising funds to construct the memorial. 
Mr. President, in 1986, the Congress enacted and President Reagan signed into law, legislation establishing a Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial, a memorial to honor the more than 5,000 African-Americans who fought for this country during the Revolutionary War. In order to appropriately recognize the bravery and sacrifice of these honorable and distinguished patriots, Public Law 99-558 sought to establish a suitable memorial, a monument which will be located on the Mall here in Washington, DC. When complete, the memorial will be the first monument on the Mall to be dedicated solely to the accomplishments of African-Americans. 
The centerpiece of P.L. 99-558 was the establishment of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Foundation, as a not-for-profit organization whose sole charter is to raise the necessary funding for the costs associated with constructing the memorial. 
When enacted, the foundation was authorized to operate for a period of 10 years. In 1996, I introduced legislation which provided an additional 2-year extension of the legislative authority for the establishment of the memorial. While the foundation has raised a substantial amount of funding, it remains short of its $9.5 million goal. The bill I introduce today would allow for a second and final extension which will provide the foundation with valuable time to complete its fundraising. 
Mr. President, this memorial serves a noble purpose, honoring the service and patriotism of individuals long deserving of this praise and I strongly support the ongoing efforts for its establishment. Likewise, I am proud that the sculptor who has been commissioned to design this memorial, Ed Dwight, is not only from my home state of Colorado, but is also the first African-American astronaut trainee. Mr. Dwight is an accomplished artist residing in Denver and his work is known across the world. I would very much like to see his design for the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial become one of the memorials situated among many of this country's most distinguished monuments. 
Mr. President, I believe Congress has demonstrated its commitment to the establishment of the Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial by authorizing its construction 10 years ago. It is my hope this legislation will receive the full, expeditious support of the Senate.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an important funding issue contained in the Treasury and General Government appropriations bill. This appropriations bill provides $84 million for construction of an annex to the Rogers Courthouse in Denver. The General Services Administration has included this project high on its list of priorities, at the recommendation of the Administrative Offices of the Courts. GSA and the AOC have provided me with detailed information on the costs of this courthouse and assured me repeatedly that these costs are prudent, practical and necessary to meet the future judicial needs of Colorado. I have also been assured that the renovated courthouse will be functional, but not extravagant. I have demanded this of every project on the list and will continue to work to ensure that this standard is applied to all new construction. Members of the Federal bench in Colorado have expressed gratitude that I have included construction money for the Rogers Courthouse. I am of course happy to help meet the needs of our federal legal system, especially in Colorado. In addition to the Rogers Courthouse, this bill contains fourteen other projects totaling almost $500 million. I believe that if Congress is going to pass laws, we'd better provide sufficient attorneys and judges to enforce those laws and adequate facilities in which those laws may be administered. 
I am aware of the growing federal caseload in other parts of Colorado. For example, the City of Grand Junction is experiencing rapid growth, and with that comes a need for more government attorneys and judges. Being from the West Slope, I appreciate the time and expense required to travel to Denver. Traveling 5 or 8 hours to get to a federal court can be a burden to all parties in federal lawsuits. 
While I am happy to accommodate the wish of the federal bench in Colorado to provide this money, I will continue to listen to members of the Colorado Federal Bar, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and other areas of the state that experience growing needs for judges and courtroom space to ensure that this appropriations bill accurately provides for the needs of the entire state.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, we spent almost 2 hours on the Ashcroft amendment. I assume that much of the debate that we have already gone through will be repeated. 
I don't think there is anyone on this floor who doesn't want to do something about the marriage penalty. We are all very comfortable with the fact that it is punitive, and I think all of us want to get rid of it, if we can. The question really has been, What is the vehicle to be able to do that? 
I ask the minority leader, since we have spent so much time on this already in the previous debate, if he would be interested in trying to work out some kind of a time agreement, because we have about 56 amendments that we haven't cleared yet. It looks like it is going to be a long night, and a long day tomorrow, if we don't get some withdrawn, or some agreement on some of them. 
I ask the minority leader if he would be interested in a time agreement.

We know we have spent an awful lot of money on this program in the last few years, but clearly it is having an effect on reducing teenage drug use in particular. I just wanted to add my comments to those of the Senator from Utah that this is a good amendment.

Following morning business, under a previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 2132, the Department of Defense appropriations bill. Members are encouraged to come to the floor early during Thursday's session to offer and debate amendments to the defense bill. The first votes of Thursday's session will be in a stacked series at 2 p.m. Those votes will include any remaining amendments to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill and possibly amendments to the defense appropriations bill.

We are now wrestling, in fact, with the request for the six high-density drug trafficking areas which are all becoming more expensive, and certainly they work in an allied fashion, because people who get out of FLETC sometimes go into those different agencies. But I want to assure the Senator I am very supportive and we will do our very best to come up with the money necessary to deal with the President's request.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to assure the Senator we are doing our very best to find a resolution in the funding of this. We have four that we are working with. And just in my own personal experience of having worked with several, particularly one in Denver, CO, I am certainly aware of the good work that they do in coordinating local, State, tribal and Federal law enforcement agencies so they are not duplicating their efforts and so that these agencies can share ideas and share resources. 
The Senator's comments certainly underscore the importance of trying to stop the growth of the methamphetamine labs. These things are volatile. They are mobile. They are contaminative, so even when you do go through an expensive process of cleaning them up, you still have to worry about what it has done to contaminate the area, particularly the earth. 
So I just want to assure him, we are working very hard to find a resolution to make sure they are all funded properly. I thank the Senator for his comments.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. Senator Ashcroft will be immediately recognized to offer his marriage penalty amendment. It is expected a motion to table the Ashcroft amendment will be offered after a reasonable amount of debate time. Following that vote, it is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate remaining amendments on the Treasury bill. 
Upon disposition of the Treasury appropriations bill, the Senate may begin consideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill, health care reform, any other appropriations bills or conference reports as available, and any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. Therefore, Members should expect a late night session, with votes throughout the day, as the Senate attempts to complete its work prior to the August recess. 
Finally, the leader would like to remind Members that the Senate will recess today from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow the weekly party caucuses to meet. 
I thank the President and yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to lay before the Senate the committee recommendation for the Treasury Department, the Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and various independent agencies. The bill crafted by the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government contains a total of $29,923,547,000 in new budget authority. 
Of that amount, $13,613,547,000 is in mandatory accounts, and $3,250,000,000 is provided for much-needed funding for all Federal agencies to address the year 2000, or Y2K, computer problem, contingent upon an emergency designation by the administration. 
The committee recommendation is within the 302(b) allocations and strikes a delicate balance between congressional priorities, administrative initiatives, and agency needs. This would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation from my friend and colleague, Senator Kohl, the subcommittee ranking member, and his staff. It was not easy to strike this balance while staying within our mutually agreed-upon fiscal constraints. As most of our colleagues are aware, approximately 80 percent of the accounts in this bill are for salaries and expenses, meeting those needs, and increasing our flexibility to fund new initiatives and congressional priorities. 
The committee recommends a funding of $11,555,000,137 for title I for the Department of Treasury. This is $176.653 million more than the fiscal year 1998 enacted level. The committee has again placed a priority on promoting the Treasury's law enforcement, ensuring that they can hire, train, and retrain the best of Federal law enforcement, while at the same time support efforts by State and local law enforcement. 
There are some provisions of title I that I would like to highlight for colleagues. This bill includes $132 million for law enforcement initiatives through the violent crime reduction trust fund, known as the VCRTF; continuation and expansion of the Gang Resistance Education And Training Program, called the GREAT Program--to help our young people develop the skills to stay out of trouble; $27 million to continue and expand the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative--to allow Federal, State, and local law enforcement to stem the tide of illegal firearms trafficking to the youth of this country. It includes doubling a staff level for the Customs Service antichild pornography efforts; full funding for Southwest border technology enhancements and staffing; additional funding for the IRS for much-needed customer service initiatives. 
In title II, the committee recommends an appropriation of $71.195 million for the U.S. Postal Service. Under the provisions of this bill, the Postal Service is required to provide free mailing for overseas voters and the blind, maintain 6-day delivery and rural delivery, as well as prohibited from consolidating or closing small and rural post offices. 
Title III is the Executive Office of the President and funds appropriated to the President. The total recommendation for title III is $3,838,441,000. This includes the White House Office, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the National Drug Control Policy, the Federal drug control programs, and funding for the National Antidrug Media Campaign. Also included is the information technology system and related expenses account to deal with the year 2000 problems. 
Of special note are: $13 million for the continuation of the technology transfer program under the drug czar's office--to allow State and local law enforcement to benefit from research and development; $175 million to continue the National Antidrug Media Campaign; continued funding for high-intensity drug trafficking areas, known as HIDTAs. 
Title IV is independent agencies such as the Federal Election Commission, General Services Administration, and the National Archives, in addition to agencies involved in Federal employment, such as the Federal Labor Relations Authority, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of Government Ethics, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Office of Special Counsel. The committee recommends $14,458,969,000 for this title. 
Of particular interest to many of our colleagues is the funding level for the General Services Administration, which includes $500 million for new courthouse construction. 
In order to stay within the 302(b) allocations, we were forced to make many difficult decisions regarding outlays. Although I know this is not unique to the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee, our outlays allocations forced us to make difficult choices, which we would not have otherwise made. 
This bill deserves the support of the Senate. I believe I can honestly say that although not everybody got what they wanted, we did our best to accommodate all of our colleagues' requests. I must remind my colleagues that if you are considering any additional spending in this bill, it must be offset. 
Finally, none of this would have been possible without the work and support of Senator Kohl. I particularly thank Barbara Retzlaff of his staff, who consistently brings her knowledge and expertise to this bill, and also our own staff, Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin and Lula Edwards, who have worked so hard and so many evenings on this bill. 
At this time, I yield the floor to my friend, Senator Kohl.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I send the first amendment to the desk, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Senator Leahy, whom I found to be very poignant and very moving in his tribute to the two slain officers. 
Today, Mr. President, is sad day indeed for the congressional family, because in just 30 minutes--in fact, a little less than that--we will all participate in a memorial for Detective John Gibson and Officer `J.J.' Jacob Joseph Chestnut, who gave their lives in the line of duty this past Friday. 
In fact, the Capitol Police patch which I wear today in memory and honor was given to me by Detective Gibson just a few weeks ago. As late as 2 weeks ago, he was kind enough to come out all the way to Dulles Airport when I had a delayed flight and get me here on time for a vote on Monday night. 
I was a military policeman, Mr. President, and a deputy sheriff in my younger days. Like most former law enforcement officers, like Senator Leahy was, perhaps the death of these two wonderful men touched us in a very special way, because for law enforcement people, when a law enforcement officer is killed, it is not like losing a stranger or a colleague, it is like losing a brother or a sister. 
But our system of democracy mandates that our citizens, who own this building, have a right to enter it at any time. I think that is the way it should be. Most of us want to keep it that way, as Senator Kohl has alluded to. 
Today, however, we debate the Treasury, Postal, and General Government appropriations bill. This bill, above any bill with which we have wrestled, determines the use of and restrictions on firearms. The framers of the Constitution, I believe, could never have foreseen the nuances that have come into play in modern America when we discuss our second amendment rights. 
Mr. President, in this very saddened atmosphere in which we bring our bill to the floor, I suppose some of our colleagues may be tempted in the heat of the time to load this bill down with gun amendments. I, frankly, hope that does not happen. It may be the right issue. It may be the right place to talk about them. But this is not the right time. To use this bill as a vehicle for any rush to judgment with those amendments, or to use it as an anti-second amendment platform, I think would be inappropriate and unwise. 
No one is more saddened at the loss of our two officer heroes than I am. But I would like to tell my colleagues who are watching these proceedings in their offices now that I intend to move to table any gun amendments that may be offered during this tragic time.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in January of 1999 the rank-and-file Federal employees will automatically receive a salary adjustment based upon the employment cost index. Most people refer to this as the COLA. Some simply call it a pay raise. 
Under current law, a similar adjustment is made to the salaries of senior-level Federal employees, Members of Congress, and Federal judges also. This adjustment is automatic under the provisions of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, unless Congress takes an affirmative action to block the increase. 
The bill before us today includes the language to prevent the automatic pay adjustment from going into effect in January for Members of Congress, Federal judges, and senior-level employees of the executive branch. 
The text of the provision is slightly different from that which passed the House of Representatives and, therefore, makes it a conferenceable item. 
This amendment which we offer today makes that provision identical to the House-passed version. 
I am happy to yield to my colleague, Senator Kohl, if he has any statement on this.

<TEXT>
Mr. CAMPBELL. While we have a few moments, I thought I would describe a couple of sections of this bill. One that might be of interest to our colleagues deals with the vehicle program description. 
This bill contains a significant amount of funding for the Treasury's law enforcement activities. Senator Kohl and myself are very strong supporters of Treasury's law enforcement efforts. 
As our colleagues know, in our fiscal year 1998 bill, we included a request for GAO to do a study on the utilization of vehicles by Treasury's law enforcement bureaus. I have to tell you at the outset, this committee does all it can to ensure that the law enforcement agents within Treasury are well equipped to do their duties. 
However, when I became chairman of the subcommittee, I noticed that all law enforcement bureaus in Treasury would put forth requests for new vehicles, stating that many of their vehicles `were well above GSA standards,' which in this case means the speedometers said 100,000 miles or more on them. 
Upon further discussion with the bureaus, it became apparent that agents have door-to-door use of their vehicles. The rationale here was, if the law enforcement officer is called for duty during their off-duty hours, they need to be able to reach the scene in a vehicle which is up to law enforcement standards. 
Having been a former law enforcement officer myself, as I mentioned earlier in the day, I understand and support that rationale that agents must have a vehicle in case they are called to duty unexpectedly. But I do have some difficulty with the fact that it appears that all agents are getting cars which they use for home-to-work transportation, regardless of their position, regardless of the probability of being called while they are at home at all. 
The GAO study told us that there is no consistent management of these vehicles, nor is there any determination of need based on how likely it is for one agent to be called to duty once at home. Many of our colleagues may not know this, but when the Government purchases a law enforcement vehicle, it is different from a vehicle that we drive on the highway. For example, it has to be especially equipped with a larger engine, sometimes the springs or shocks are reworked, and they certainly have special radios, and it is not uncommon for this special equipment to cost $10,000 or more per vehicle. 
Therefore, when the vehicles are used for transportation to and from work, the useful life of the vehicle is certainly decreased, and the Government carries the burden of replacing the vehicles sooner than they had planned. Given our tighter budgets, I felt the Treasury needed to get a handle on how they manage this vehicle pool. This year alone, the Treasury requested approximately $30 million to acquire new vehicles. Currently, the bureau manages the usage terms of the vehicles and all the associated costs in a rather indiscriminate fashion. In Treasury's defense, we were pleased to see that they had requested $1 million in this year's budget for a vehicle tracking program, which we have funded. 
What we did not fund was the acquisition of new vehicles beyond what the bureaus are already carrying in their budgets. However, I should make it clear that there is funding contained in each bureau's budget to cover the cost of replacing the oldest vehicles. So what we are really doing here is maintaining the current fleet while replacing the oldest, while not adding to the total number of vehicles in the fleet. The rationale here is that the Treasury needs to put this management system in place before we appropriate additional moneys to purchase even more new vehicles. I tell my colleagues, it is a very plain and simple, good Government provision. Senator Kohl and I support law enforcement agents within the Treasury, but I cannot imagine that each and every one of them will have a reasonable chance to be called for duty every night. 
As an appropriator, I think it is my responsibility to ask questions about cost management, and we have told the agencies that we will hold them accountable for their costs. In this case, it is vehicle usage which directly impacts the life of the vehicle and ultimately the cost to the Government. During fiscal year 1998, the Department of the Treasury spent a great amount of money for vehicle-related expenses. 
I believe this is a much-needed step, and I hope this new vehicle management program will improve Treasury's ability to accurately project vehicle replacement, maintenance, and need for new vehicles. In addition, I hope the Treasury's program will include the impact that portal-to-portal usage has on the maintenance or life of the vehicle. We are certainly looking forward to working with the Treasury to put this new system in place. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this amendment is not new language, as Senator Kohl has alluded, because under current law, there was an original ban of 10 years. This simply extends that current language for another 5 years. 
I have checked with the majority, and the people I have checked with so far are supportive of this amendment, but Senator Hatch has asked if we can lay this amendment aside for a few minutes because he would like to read it more carefully, if that is acceptable to Senator Kohl.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a Senate concurrent resolution to rename the Document Door as the Chestnut-Gibson Memorial Door. I feel that it is only fitting that this door be named in honor of the two brave Capitol Police Officers, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, who just last Friday, gave their lives in the line of duty while serving their country. 
Last Friday's shocking and senseless violence in the halls of the U.S. Capitol both saddened our nation and took the lives of two of our finest. 
Officer Jacob Chestnut was posted at the Document Door entrance on the Capitol's East Front. Officers posted to this entrance are the first faces that many tourists see when they come to visit the Capitol. Officer Chestnut's post, which involves achieving a delicate balance between the ensuring safety of those who visit the Capitol while keeping the People's House as free and open as possible, requires a very special combination of hospitality, humor, patience and professionalism. To his credit, Officer Chestnut excelled in this endeavor. 
Detective John Gibson was the second Capitol Police Officer to engage the gunman. I understand that it was Detective John Gibson's last shot, his final act of a defender of the peace, that brought the gunman down and ended the violent rampage. The Detective's steadfast valor, while already having been shot several times, was the difference that saved many lives. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude. 
If it had not been for the heroic actions of these two brave officers, this dangerous gunman would almost certainly have killed many more innocent people. The two officer's ultimate sacrifice saved many lives. 
This building, the U.S. Capitol, is far more than just a building, it is a living monument to freedom and democracy. It is perhaps the only building on earth that simultaneously houses a healthy democracy at work, while standing as a tribute to freedom that attracts millions of visitors from all over the U.S. and the entire world each year. The chambers, galleries and halls of our Capitol are full of statues, busts, paintings and displays that 
commemorate heroes and key events in our nation's history. The men and women honored under this magnificent dome have served their country in a wide variety of ways. Some have been great visionaries and statesmen. Some have been leaders in science or adventurers, like Colorado's son, astronaut Jack Swigert whose statue stands in these halls. Each of these heroes has contributed and sacrificed in his or her own very real and personal way. 
Some of these heroes have made the greatest sacrifice for their nation, giving their lives. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut have joined this honored rank. They gave their lives for their nation while protecting our nation's Capitol, and it is fitting that they will lie in honor today in the Capitol's Rotunda while a grateful nation pays its respects. 
Not only is the Capitol the American people's house, it stands as a bright beacon of hope to all of the world's freedom loving people. While traveling this building's halls, I have been regularly awed by the comments of visitors from other countries about how open and free this building is. They state how they would never be allowed to walk so freely through the halls of their own capital buildings back home in their respective countries. This is an important part of what makes America great. 
Whenever I have heard such sentiments, I am reminded of just how fortunate I am, and we all are, to be Americans. Our Capitol is the People's House, and it must remain open and accessible to all. 
Thanks to the sacrifices of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, and the dedication and professionalism of the entire U.S. Capitol Police force, our nation's Capitol building is freely accessible and continues to serve as a beacon of freedom. 
For these reasons I feel that it is only fitting that the Document Door be renamed in honor of the two brave Capitol Police Officers, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, who gave their lives so that the Capitol building could remain the People's House and open to all.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to two Capitol Police officers, two heroes, who last Friday gave their lives in the line of duty while serving their country, Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut. 
Last Friday's shocking and senseless violence in the halls of the U.S. Capitol both saddened our nation and took the lives of two of our finest. I would like to take a moment to share a few memories and thoughts about the two slain officers. 
About a month ago, in late June, I had the chance to start a new friendship with a good man. I had the pleasure to get to know John Gibson, not just as a able and dedicated detective, but also as a gentleman and dedicated family man. 
During our time together, I learned that we shared common values and a similar hobby. As a former deputy sheriff myself, it quickly became evident that Detective Gibson and I shared an understanding of the daily perils facing law enforcement officers. 
Detective Gibson and I also discovered that we both shared the rather unique hobby of collecting police patches. In fact, just last month I sent him several police arm patches from Colorado to add to his collection as a small token of my appreciation for his dedicated service. 
I understand that it was Detective John Gibson's final shot, his final act as a defender of the peace, that brought the gunman down and ended the violent rampage. The Detective's steadfast valor, while already having been shot several times, was the difference that saved many lives. We all owe him a deep debt of gratitude. 
Officer Jacob Chestnut was posted at the Document Door entrance on the Capitol's East Front. Officers posted to this entrance are the first faces that many tourists see when they come to visit the Capitol.

To his credit, Officer Chestnut excelled in this endeavor. 
If it had not been for the heroic actions of these two brave officers, this dangerous gunman would almost certainly have killed many more innocent people. The officer's ultimate sacrifice saved lives. I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of these two fallen heroes. 
This building, the U.S. Capitol, is far more than just a building, it is a living monument to freedom and democracy.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I begin my statement today describing a powerful and emotional sight that moves us to the core of our faith and beliefs about America and about those who have served in the Armed Forces of our nation. 
Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that train our future military leaders. These academies have varied missions and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing leaders for their particular service and our country. On the grounds of each academy is a chapel, a spectacular place that at once identifies itself as a place of worship. 
In each chapel, a place has been reserved for the Prisoners of War and the Missing in Action from their particular branch of service. A pew has been set aside and marked by a candle, a powerful, symbolic reminder that not all have returned from battle. This hallowed place has been set aside so that all POWs and MIAs are remembered with the dignity and honor they deserve. It is a moving and emotional moment to pause at this reserved pew, to be encouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of those soldiers, sailors or pilots, and to be inspired today by what they have done. 
Back in 1970, a wife of a soldier missing in action made a simple request to have a flag designed for a small group of families whose loved ones were prisoners or missing in action in Southeast Asia. As a member of the National League of Families she felt the organization needed a symbol. This symbol, a black and white flag, with a silhouette of a bowed head set against a guard tower and a single strand of barb wire, was designed by Newt Heisley. 
Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families POW/MIA flag. This flag has become a powerful symbol to all Americans that we have not forgotten--and will not forget. Since its creation, the flag has flown over numerous state and federal buildings, and has even been adopted by similar organizations in Kuwait, Chechnya, Bosnia, and other countries. 
Newt Heisley made the sketch of this symbol over a couple of days in a New Jersey advertising studio, never imagining the impact the design he created almost 27 years ago would have. Mr. Heisley used the inspiration of his ill son returning from Marine training at Quantico, Virginia for the silhouette. Otherwise the flag was just a quick sketch that wasn't even supposed to be black and white. Mr. Heisley planned on adding colors but the black and white motif remained. 
Mr. Heisley, first realized how popular the symbol had become when he moved to Colorado Springs in 1972. Only two years after he made the design he was touring the Air Force Academy when he saw the flag on display at the visitors center. Today, the flag is a national symbol that is seen on everything from ball caps to bumper stickers. 
A veteran of World War II, Mr. Heisley knows of the importance of his design. We must never forget those who gave their lives for our country. Mr. Heisley never felt the need to profit from the POW/MIA flag design. The image was never copyrighted and today is used by many companies and organizations. Mr. Heisley was simply glad to create a symbol that honors veterans and the sacrifices they made for our country and freedom. 
Mr. President, the United States has fought in many wars and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by the enemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th Century wars alone, more than 147,000 Americans were captured and became Prisoners of War; of that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to this number those who are still missing in action, we realize the tremendous importance of their presence through the POW/MIA flag. The POW/MIA flag is a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but also for their families who personally carry with them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, and remember the loyalty and devotion of those who served. 
As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the remembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and most noble acts we can offer. Newt Heisley has inspired this remembrance and honor and I thank him, personally, for this tremendous symbol that shall endure forever.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I seek recognition to raise an important issue with the manager of this bill, Senator Gregg. 
One area of growing concern in my home state of Colorado is the production, distribution and use of methamphetamines. To help law enforcement address this problem, I pushed for designation and funding of the Rocky Mountain HIDTA which is operating in many regions of the state, and secured additional funding in the Treasury subcommittee for a methamphetamine initiative through the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I also have supported budget increases for the Drug Enforcement Administration, but believe that agency can do much more, especially to help Western Colorado. 
The Western Slope of Colorado is becoming a major drug transit point because of its close proximity to I-70, its easy access to trains, buses and planes, and the large geographic areas which law enforcement officers have to patrol. The scope of the methamphetamine problem in this area recently was underscored by the Grand Junction Chief of Police, Gary Konzak. Chief Konzak informed me that `the quality of life of this city and the safety of its citizens are in peril if significant and organized law enforcement resources are not deployed soon to combat this menace.' 
Based on his almost 30 years of law enforcement in Chicago before coming to Colorado, Chief Konzak believes neighborhoods and communities in Western Colorado are vulnerable to degradation similar to what he witnessed when crack cocaine arrived in the Chicago area in the early and mid 1980s. 
Mr. President, in Colorado the DEA operates a regional office in Denver and recently established a field office in Glenwood Springs. However, I believe the DEA can do much more to assist police chiefs and sheriffs in Mesa County, Montrose County and other counties on the Western Slope. 
The bill we are considering today includes a significant increase in the DEA's budget for the coming fiscal year. The bill also includes $24.5 million and 100 agents specifically for the Methamphetamine Initiative to target and investigate methamphetamine trafficking, production and abuse. 
Chief Konzak and other law enforcement officials throughout the Western Slope believe there is an urgent need for a DEA presence, through a field office or permanently assigned agents. I strongly support their request for assistance from the DEA and ask the Chairman for his support.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to lend my support to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, for several reasons. 
The Internet presents opportunities for education, business, and governance that were unthinkable until recently. Concepts such as `distance learning', and `e-commerce' are tied to this new and little understood technology. 
As a Congress and as a nation, we must come to grips with this technology in a way that encourages development and at the same time provides protection from abuses for our most vulnerable citizens. 
So let me start out by saying that I have a healthy respect for the Internet and the possibilities it holds. 
Like Senator Kyl, however, I am troubled by unregulated gambling and other objectionable material or services being offered on the Internet, particularly when young children and other vulnerable people are involved. 
Nonetheless, as chairman of the committee on Indian affairs, I must point out that there are several objectionable provisions in the bill before us, not the least of which is that S. 474 amends the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in significant ways, without the benefit of committee deliberations, or the input of the many affected tribes. 
I firmly believe that any legislation aimed at Internet gambling should be `technology-neutral' and not tied to or focused on a specific technology. 
Given the creativity and genius of computer and high-tech individuals, such as framework would quickly become obsolete--and require new legislation. 
For instance, there are 30 Indian tribes operating games like `Megabingo' and `satellite bingo'; dozens of tribes that operate parimutuel betting and other games that are authorized by and regulated under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
The IGRA provides that bingo games that rely on or use electronic or technological aids, are legal and are explicitly permitted by the IGRA. 
In addition to the jurisdictional issues raised, S. 474 would criminalize certain games that are legally played as class II games under the IGRA. 
When the IGRA was enacted in 1988, the position of this Congress was to `provide maximum flexibility' to tribes in terms of technology or in terms of conducting multi-state operations through the use of such technology. 
The Congress' intent included the use of technological aids for bingo and similar games `on or off of Indian lands.' The bill before us should provide a categorical exception for these and similar games. 
The bill defines `person' as including `other governments' which may be construed to include tribal governments. Together with section 4, which authorizes state attorneys general and other state officials to bring enforcement actions against Indian tribes for violations that occur on Indian lands, this provision will alter the law regarding jurisdiction in ways that I strongly oppose. 
This bill is a serious change in federal Indian law not seen since the enactment of `P.L. 280' in 1953, which conferred state jurisdiction over Indian lands without tribal consent. 
Section 4 is also in direct conflict with the IGRA, which provides the United States with enforcement authority over Indian gaming activities. 
The civil enforcement remedy granted to the states in S. 474 is unnecessary and unwarranted. Current law provides that class II gaming is regulated by the tribes and the federal government; and class III gaming is regulated pursuant to tribal-state compacts. Contrary to the assertions of many, the Indian gaming industry is subject to many layers of regulation. 
Federal law already establishes enforcement remedies under the IGRA. These very jurisdictional issues arose when Congress considered the IGRA. 
In 1987, the Supreme Court decided the Cabazon case which says that Indian tribes have the right to conduct gaming on Indian lands largely unhindered by state interference. With S. 474, we are re-opening an issue that has been settled for years. 
Tribes and states can and often do resolve these issues in negotiations. Tribal-State compacts, and P.L. 280, only allow state enforcement activities with the consent of the affected tribes. 
The IGRA established the mechanisms for tribes and states to negotiate and come to agreement on these matters and some tribes and states have freely entered negotiations to resolve these matters--in the form of state-tribal compacts. 
Third, this bill amends the IGRA by requiring that any persons who place or receive the wagers involved be `physically located' on Indian lands. 
As my friend from Idaho knows, there is ongoing litigation to determine the meaning of the term `on Indian lands' contained in the IGRA. 
One question that is inherent in this debate over S. 474 is determining where the `transactions' that will be prohibited will take place? 
Recognizing the complexities of Internet commerce and the tax issue, the nation's Governors recently agreed that an enlightened policy requires more information and deferred a decision regarding a `national Internet sales tax policy'. 
The notion that with this or any other bill, the United States can stop the flow of electronic gambling on American modems and computers is just not realistic. 
For instance, the Caribbean nations of Antigua and Barbados actively promote what they call their `on-line casinos' to players both on the islands and to anyone off the islands with a computer. 
So one consequence of this bill if enacted will be the elimination of American-based Internet gaming providers to the benefit of off-shore gaming operators like our friends in the Caribbean. Will this Congress ever stop pursuing policies that send American jobs overseas? 
Last, let me say a few things about the `Craig amendment' which I believe will eliminate the conflicts between S. 474 and the Indian gaming act and will appropriately provide that those games that are currently authorized and regulated under the IGRA would remain outside the purview of this legislation. 
I am in favor of tribes and others being treated similarly as far as Internet gaming goes, and feel very strongly that tribes should not be singled out either for special treatment or for special scrutiny as far as the Indian Gaming Regulatory act goes. 
As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I know full well the controversy that surrounds gaming activities. I also know that the Indian gaming act represents a complex and delicate balance of competing interests--including state and tribal interests. 
The tribes are seeking nothing more than what is already sanctioned under federal law in the form of the IGRA. As is the case with the Coeur d'Alene tribe, there is now pending federal litigation that the Congress ought not upset in the form of this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Craig amendment to provide equity and fairness to this Internet gaming legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. It seems that in every Congress the issue of `death taxes' comes before this body at some time. Each year we tinker around the edges of the issue, making adjustments here and exemptions there. But the fact is, estate and gift taxes still remain a burden on American families, particularly those who own their own businesses. 
Family-owned businesses are hit with the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants. In fact, the highest estate and gift tax rate is fifty-five percent--that's far higher than even the highest income tax rate bracket of thirty-nine percent. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading reasons why family farms and small businesses are declining; the burden of the inheritance tax is just too crushing. That hardly seems fair to me. It also seems to suggest that families should spend as much money as they can while they are still alive, since whatever they have managed to save will create a huge tax burden when passed on to their descendants. 
That is why today I am introducing the Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of 1998, which will gradually eliminate this tax burden. That's right, I said eliminate, not reduce. This bill will phase-out the estate and gift tax by gradually reducing the amount of the tax by five percent each year until the highest rate--55%--reaches zero. Several states have already taken the initiative and phased out this type of tax on their own. I think it's time we follow the example they have set, and eliminate them across the board. At the same time, we will be encouraging better investment, savings and retirement planning by relieving the threat of an impending tax crisis. 
This legislation is a companion bill to H.R. 3879, introduced by our colleague in the House, Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn. I hope my colleagues will support passage of this bill, and will join me in putting a real end to this oppressive and unfair tax.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr President, today I take this opportunity to recognize the 30th anniversary and reunion of the United Mexican-American Students of Colorado. 
In July 1968, Mexican-American students at the University of Colorado at Boulder came together to discuss the formation of an organization committed to initiating change within the educational system to serve the needs of the Mexican-American community and to recruit minority students to the institution. The outcome of that meeting was the formation of the United Mexican-American Students (UMAS). 
Later that same summer, fifty minority students were admitted into a tutorial program initiated by university professors and students to make higher education accessible to African American and Chicano students. UMAS students worked for the program. The Migrant Action Program also brought migrant workers into the university and they also became UMAS members. 
A student referendum initiated and supported by UMAS was passed in March 1969 which dedicated five dollars from registration fees each semester to create scholarships for minority students. These funds and federal matching funds allowed UMAS to implement tutorial counseling, recruitment and financial aid programs. On-campus accredited summer remedial programs followed. Students who successfully completed those classes gained admission and earned financial aid. 
UMAS has thrived on the Boulder Campus of the University of Colorado for three decades. This summer marks the thirtieth anniversary of the organization. To mark this important anniversary, UMAS alumni and supporters will come together to renew their commitment and unity. 
Mr. President, I commend the work of UMAS students and alumni associations for their commitment and continuing efforts to serve deserving students on the Boulder campus of the University of Colorado. As someone who has experienced hardship, I sincerely appreciate the empowerment UMAS has offered to thousands of deserving students.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to help our nation's state and local law enforcement officers acquire the bullet resistant equipment they need to protect themselves from would-be killers. This bill, the Officer Dale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1998, is named after a Cortez, Colorado, police officer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car on May 29, 1998, after stopping a stolen truck. Officer Claxton was tragically and prematurely taken away from his wife and four children. Today, two of the three suspects are still at large, even after an extensive manhunt. 
Unfortunately, this type of incident is far from isolated. All across our nation law enforcement officers, whether parked on the side of the road or in hot pursuit, are at risk of being shot through their windshields. Another example that many of my colleagues may be aware of is the brutal murder of the District of Columbia's Officer Brian Gibson, who was ambushed and shot while sitting in his patrol car. We must do what we can to prevent tragedies like this. 
As a former deputy sheriff, I am personally aware of the dangers which law enforcement officers face on the front lines every day. One way in which the federal government can improve their safety is to help them acquire bullet resistant glass and other equipment for patrol cars. These partnership grants are especially crucial for officers who serve in small local jurisdictions that often lack the funds to provide their officers with all of the life saving equipment they may need. 
The Officer Dale Claxton bill builds on the impact of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which I introduced and the President signed into law on June 16, 1998. This new program provides grants to law enforcement agencies to purchase body armor for their officers. The Officer Dale Claxton bill extends this protection to include bullet resistant equipment for the officers' vehicles, shields, and any other equipment that officers may need when they are serving out on the front lines of law enforcement. 
The bill I introduce today has two major components. The first is to provide a matching grant program for state, county, local and tribal law enforcement agencies. This legislation would authorize the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Assistance to administer a $40 million matching grant program to assist these agencies purchase bullet resistant equipment for patrol cars, including bullet resistant glass, panels, and other safety devices. 
The program will provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor. To ensure that the funding goes first to those police departments which need it most, the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is given discretion to give preferential consideration to smaller departments whose budgets are scarce. 
Additionally, those jurisdictions which do not receive any funding under the local law enforcement block grant program will be given preference. Furthermore, at least half of the funds available under this program will be awarded to jurisdictions with less than 100,000 residents. 
The second component of this legislation would launch an expedited and targeted research and development effort to come up with new technologies and products. Promising new light-weight bullet proof materials now being developed could be as revolutionary in the year 2000 as the development of Kevlar was in the 1970s for the manufacture of body armor. These exciting new technologies promise to be lighter, more versatile and hopefully less expensive than traditional heavy bulletproof glass. 
The Officer Dale Claxton bill authorizes $3 million over 3 years for the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) to conduct research and development of a new bullet resistant technologies, such as bonded acrylic, polymers, polycarbons, aluminized material, and transparent ceramics. This R and D program would focus on specialized equipment, including windshield glass, car panels, police shields and other types of protective gear. 
The Officer Dale Claxton bill directs the National Institute of Justice to inventory existing technologies in the private sector, in surplus military property, and in use by other countries. The bill also directs the Institute to conduct: standards development; technology development; technical testing; operational testing; evaluation; and technology transfer. 
Under the bill, the Institute would give priority in testing and engineering surveys to law enforcement partnerships developed in coordination with existing High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTAs). 
Our nation's police officers, sheriffs and deputies regularly put their lives in harm's way as they protect the people and preserve the peace. They deserve to have access to the bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill will both accelerate the development of new lifesaving bullet resistant technologies and then help get them deployed into the field where they are needed. Lives will be saved.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to submit an amendment which will update legislation I introduced last year. On July 31, 1997, I introduced a bill, S. 1112, which would authorize the Mint to produce a commemorative Buffalo Nickel, based on the design of the original nickel which was in circulation from 1913 to 1938. In February of this year, I presented the design of the coin to the Mind and provided testimony regarding the history of the nickel and its design. Former Ambassador to Austria and Colorado buffalo rancher, Swanee Hunt, joined me at this presentation to share her support. 
Since introducing that bill and making the presentation, I have been working closely with officials at the Treasury and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The recommendation of the Committee is necessary in order to bring the coin into circulation. In their annual report, the Committee approved the minting of a coin, based on the design of the Buffalo Nickel. However, the CCCAC recommended that the coin be a half-dollar denomination, rather that a nickel, which will go into circulation in 2001. 
This amendment I am submitting today reflects their recommendation and complies with Title 31, the Commemorative Coin Act. All proceeds from the sale of this coin will continue to be paid to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian, as the original legislation directed. The Committee's recommendation to put the coin into circulation in 2001 will coincide well with the Museum's scheduled opening date of 2002. 
This legislation reflects the goals of all interested parties, and still maintains the original goal of raising funds for the preservation of Native American artifacts in the Museum of the American Indian. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the School Resource Officers Partnership Grant Act of 1998, a bill which will be an important step in our efforts to end crime in our nation's schools. This bill will help build thousands of deep, meaningful and lasting partnerships between America's local school systems, school children, and local law enforcement agencies. I am joined in introducing this legislation by my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jim Jeffords, as an original cosponsor. 
The need for this bill is clear. Violence in schools is both serious and deadly. Violence is disrupting our children's opportunity and ability to learn. No child anywhere in America should have to go to school with fear on their mind, rather than learning. The recent school-related shootings stand as stark and horrific examples of just how urgent the situation has become. These recent school shootings have occurred in suburbs, small towns, and major metropolitan areas all across our nation. They have shattered the myth that school violence is a problem solely confined to the inner cities. Events now clearly show that the potential for serious and deadly school violence is everywhere. Something must be done to ensure that our schools provide a safe place for our children to learn and grow. 
Under this bill, schools in partnerships with local law enforcement agencies would be eligible to receive federal funding to hire `School Resource Officers' (SROs). A SRO would be a career law enforcement officer, with sworn authority, deployed in community oriented policing, and assigned by the employing police department or agency to work in collaboration with schools and community-based organizations. The SROs would be able to assist in several primary activities. First, SROs would address crime and disorder problems with a special focus on gangs, drug-related activities, and other crimes occurring in or around our schools. Second, SROs would develop or expand crime prevention efforts in cooperation with students. Third, SROs would help educate potential school-age victims in crime prevention and personal safety awareness. Fourth, SROs would develop or expand community justice initiatives. Fifth, and clearly increasingly more important in light of the recent school shootings, is that the SROs would train students in conflict resolution and teach students how to resolve their differences without feeling the need to resort to violence. Where childhood schoolyard hard feelings used to occasionally result in a scuffle, we now live in a time where they are resolved with firearms and lead to serious wounds and even death. This simply must end. Sixth, SROs would help identify changes in the school environment, like new graffiti or other indications of gang activity, that provide vital indicators. And finally, SROs would assist with the development of anti-crime, school policy and procedural changes. 
According to the National School Safety Center, 25 students have been killed in U.S. schools since January 1, 1998. This is the same number of students that were killed for the full 1996 school year, but in half the time. At this rate, we are on track to a doubling of the schoolyard murder rate in just two short years. 
The current school-based partnership grant program, which is administered by the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), is not defined by statute, nor is the description of the qualifications and responsibilities of SROs. This legislation would ensure that SROs are career law enforcement officers, deployed in community-oriented policing assignments and directed by their agencies to work in collaboration with schools and other community-based organizations to address crime problems and assist school authorities in educating students about crime and violence prevention. 
This legislation complements the existing school-based partnership research grant program administered by the COPS office. The existing demonstration program provides funds to specific, and relatively small scale, youth crime prevention programs. My legislation would build on this solid foundation, and allow the COPS program resources to be freed up for widespread and comprehensive partnerships between our nation's schools and law enforcement agencies, with the SROs providing the vital link between the two. 
In addition, my bill is a companion to H.R. 4009, which our colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Jim Maloney of Connecticut, introduced on June 5, 1998. This bill has received the endorsement of a number of education and law enforcement groups including the National Education Association, the International Brotherhood of Police, the Fraternal Order of Police. I believe that this powerful combination of endorsements clearly reflects the strength of, and compelling need for, this legislation. 
On June 23rd , Senator Judd Gregg, Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary, unveiled a $210 million Safe Schools Initiative. Largely thanks to Senator Gregg, the funding needed to combat school violence is on track to be made available in a few short months, on October 1st, 1998, the start of Fiscal Year 1999. 
Together, these initiatives will target important funding and resources to where it is most urgently needed, in our nation's schools. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take a moment to acknowledge the new `Building a Better World' Award which CH2M HILL, an employee-owned company which is headquartered in Denver, has initiated. William D. Ruckelshaus, Chairman of BFI and former EPA Administrator, was presented with CH2M HILL's inaugural `Building a Better World' award in ceremonies at the Smithsonian Institution's Castle in Washington, DC on May 6, 1998. 
CH2M HILL created this award to recognize the contributions of private citizens or organizations that reflect the company's core business value of making technology work to build a better world. The work of its 7,000 employees worldwide involves assisting public and private sector clients in planning, design, program management, and often construction for drinking water, wastewater management, hazardous waste management, transportation, nuclear waste cleanup projects, and industrial activities. 
In choosing a recipient for this inaugural award, the selection panel sought to define a level of excellence that would make this award especially significant to succeeding recipients. Three key criteria are established for CH2M HILL's `Building a Better World' award: 
Honorees must be deemed to have made a significant difference in improving the lives and prospects of people and society. 
Contributions of honorees must be judged to be exceptional in nature and their impact substantial, distinctive and enduring. 
Honorees must demonstrate an extraordinary and exemplary exercise of leadership and commitment. 
In honoring Mr. Ruckelshaus with the `Building a Better World' award, CH2M HILL noted his long standing and continuing efforts in advancing environmental protection, practicing corporate responsibility, affecting sustainable development, and inspiring dynamic public and private citizenship. `Taken apart from one another, Mr. Ruckelshaus' accomplishments in business leadership, government service and environmental stewardship are extraordinary in there own right' said Ralph R. Peterson, CH2M HILL President and CEO. `Taken collectively they form a masterwork of civic character.' 
In establishing the `Building a Better World' award, CH2M HILL plans to honor people it knows firsthand to have made constructive, significant and lasting contributions to improving the lives and prospects of people and society. The award will be presented on a regular basis as deemed appropriate by the CH2M HILL Board of Directors. 
Mr. President, this special award by a leading Colorado-based company provides another example of corporate interest and support for making the world we live in a better place. 
I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. It attempts to clarify inconsistencies in implementing Public Law 102-477. Over the past four years, tribes have attempted to integrate both programs into their 477 plans. They have received at best, inconsistent responses from the BIA. On several occasions the Bureau approved the integration, and other times integration was rejected. The Bureau confirmed this confusion at a May 13, 1997 Indian Affairs Committee hearing when it submitted conflicting testimony regarding its approval of including the JOM program into tribal plans. Section 3(b) makes clear that `at the option of a tribe' funds under both the General Assistance and Johnson O'Malley programs may be integrated into tribal 477 plans.

Another letter dated March 28, 1998 states that the JOM parent committee will continue to have the authority to approve and disapprove tribal plans to integrate funds within the 477 program.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with your concern, and that is why I amended the original language of the bill to expressly require tribal governments wishing to integrate these funds into their 477 programs to include adequate assurances that such funds will be used only for those intended beneficiaries, children aged 3 through grade 12. I would, however, like to make clear that with the onset of welfare reform upon us, tribal governments must be afforded adequate flexibility to administer the limited federal resources available. This bill attempts to provide that added flexibility.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today is a very special day for both our nation's serving law enforcement officers and myself. 
At 3:00 this afternoon, Arapahoe County Sheriff Pat Sullivan and I were at the White House attending a ceremony where the President signed into law the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. The enactment of this bill is near and dear to my heart. 
During the years I served as a Deputy Sheriff in Sacramento County, California, I gained a first-hand understanding of the dangers our law enforcement officers face in the line of duty. Our brave men and women wearing a badge simply never know what life threatening dangers each new day may bring. We must do everything we can to help these officers acquire the equipment they need to stay alive while they are going about the job of protecting the American people and preserving the peace. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act will help get one of the most critical and effective pieces of life saving equipment, namely body armor, into the hands of thousands of cops who would not otherwise have the resources to access it. Simply put, this bill will save many, many lives. This bill will help prevent wives from becoming widows, husbands from becoming widowers, and children from being raised without their father or mother. 
On this special day, it is fitting to pay a tribute to one very special law enforcement officer who was killed recently while serving in the line of duty. Officer Bruce VanderJagt was killed by a hail of bullets in Denver, Colorado in November, 1997. His untimely death left his wife, Anna Marie, without her husband, and his two-year-old daughter, Hayley Louise, without her devoted father. Officer Bruce VanderJagt is remembered for his charm, his exceptional humility, his wit and intelligence as exemplified by the two master's degrees he earned, and the courage that earned him two distinguished service crosses. He will be missed. 
We must do all we can to protect law enforcement officers like Bruce VanderJagt. If even one law enforcement officer's life is saved by a bullet proof vest that would not have been available without this law, all of our hard work that went into getting this bill through Congress and today enacted into law, will have been well worth it.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to pay tribute to the Harley-Davidson Motor Company on this great American company's 95th anniversary. 
As a long time Harley-Davidson rider, I have enjoyed many years of satisfaction with the company and its legendary machines. After a long day on Capitol Hill, there is nothing I enjoy more than firing up my Softail Custom. I even had one of my two official Congressional portraits taken with my Softail in front of our nation's Capitol. When I am back home in Colorado, I tool around on my black Road King, often with my wife Linda, who also has her own Heritage Softail Classic. 
I can tell you that there is no better way to enjoy Colorado's great scenic beauty than from the saddle of a Harley-Davidson. The freedom of the open road and the often imitated, but never duplicated, throaty roar of an American-made machine is something that I have thoroughly enjoyed for countless thousands of miles. 
Harley-Davidson not only makes great motorcycles; it also exemplifies the kind of company that I am proud to support. From its humble beginnings in a small 10 foot by 15 foot shed in a Milwaukee backyard in 1903, this company had its share of good times and bad. The Great Depression was a major blow to the American motorcycle industry, and when the dust finally cleared Harley-Davidson was one of only two U.S. motorcycle manufacturers left standing. 
And it is a good thing that Harley-Davidson survived because when World War Two erupted, our country needed to call on Harley-Davidson to build bikes for U.S. and Allied troops during WW-II. Many of the orders and other messages needed to achieve victory would not have been delivered to the front lines if it had not been for brave G.I. messengers riding Harley-Davidson motorcycles. 
Following the Allied victory in World War Two, the Harley-Davidson Company refocused on developing new styles of motorcycles for the American people to enjoy. The company's second generation of management brought fresh ideas that helped usher-in the celebrated `motorcycle culture' of the 1950's and 60's. 
When Harley-Davidson hit a rough patch of road in the 1980's it was a daring combination of re-found independence, innovation and serious reengineering that brought this legendary company back from the brink. Harley-Davidson successfully carried out a classic textbook comeback that exemplifies many of our nation's best traits: independence, daring, grit, tenacity, smarts, and a penchant for continuous innovation and progress while remaining firmly rooted in our heritage. 
On that note, I conclude my tribute to the people of Harley-Davidson with my congratulations on 95 great years while looking forward to many more.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I begin my statement today thanking the various individuals and organizations that support the drug court programs. I have always been a strong supporter of drug court, and wish to express my pleasure with the `National Drug Court Week' events that are scheduled in Washington, DC this week. Recognizing the importance of practitioners who work on drug courts and the significant contributions that drug courts have made, and continue to make, in reducing drug use and crime in our communities is extremely important. I believe in the success of the drug courts and wish to acknowledge the dedicated efforts of drug court professionals. 
Drug Courts are revolutionizing the criminal justice system. The strategy behind drug courts departs from traditional criminal justice practice by placing nonviolent drug abusing offenders into intensive court supervised drug treatment instead of prison. Some drug courts target first time offenders, while others concentrate on habitual offenders. They all aim to reduce drug abuse and crime. 
Drug court programs have expanded from the original 12 in 1994 to around 400 today. Drug courts provide comprehensive judicial monitoring, drug testing and supervision, treatment and rehabilitative services, and sanctions and incentives for drug using offenders. The success of the drug court system is well documented. More than 70% of drug court clients have successfully completed the program or remain as active participants. Additionally, the cost of drug court programs are significantly less than the cost of incarceration and traditional court systems. 
In my home state of Colorado the drug court movement is growing. Started in 1994, the Denver Drug Court assigns defendants to one of three tracks. Tracks 1 and 2 are community supervision and treatment tracks. Track 3 is a serious offender incarceration track. These tracks establish the different type of programs that are offered to various offenders. 
Approximately 75% of all drug cases are appropriate for the community supervision track. At any given time, approximately 1500 cases are under court supervision. An analysis of post-conviction progress reviews of offenders under Track 1 or Track 2 demonstrates that 67% of those individuals complied with the Drug Court Program and did not use any illegal substances. Since the graduation of the first class in July 1995, the Drug Court has successfully graduated over 500 individuals. Of the 100 graduates who have been out of the Drug Court for one year or longer, only 10% have been rearrested for a felony offense. 
Last year, General McCaffrey and I had the opportunity to observe the Denver Drug Court. Through this experience I was able to see first hand the judicial procedures surrounding drug courts. I was impressed with Denver's Drug Court procedures, and believe in the success they will yield. 
I am pleased with the success of the Denver Drug Court program and support the growing programs within Colorado. I believe the success of drug courts is well documented and strong Congressional support should be given to the rehabilitation of future drug offenders. Traditional incarceration has yielded little gains for our drug offenders. Costs are too high and the rehabilitation rate is minimal. The drug courts of America are an excellent way to make strides forward in our fight against drugs. I commend the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP) in their planning and sponsoring of `National Drug Court Week' events here in Washington. The recognition of this excellent program and promotion of its initiatives is well deserved.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to introduce a bill that will help millions of water consumers throughout my state. The Denver Water Department has developed a unique plan to re-use non-potable water for irrigation and industrial uses. This bill would simply authorize the Denver Water Department to access federal funds to assist in the implementation of this plan. The Mayor of Denver has fully endorsed this legislation. I am delighted to assist the Mayor and the great City of Denver. 
Denver Water Department serves over a million customers and is the largest water supplier in the Rocky Mountain region. Due to uncertain water supplies in the semi-arid west, it is critical to make wise use of every drop of water. With this in mind, over the past several years Denver Water has developed a plan to treat and reuse some of its water supply for uses not involving human ingestion, such as irrigation and industrial purposes. In this manner, Denver will stretch its water supply without the cost and potential environmental disruption of building new reservoirs. It will also ease the demand on fresh drinking-quality water supplies. 
The Denver Nonpotable Reuse Project will treat secondary wastewater, that is water which has already been used once in Denver's system. It is an environmentally and economically viable method for extending and conserving our limited water supplies. The water quality will meet all Colorado and federal standards. The water will still be clean and odorless, but since it will be used for irrigation and industrial uses around the Denver International Airport and the Rocky Mountain Wildlife Refuge, the additional expense to treat it for drinking will be avoided. 
The nonpotable project is constructed in three phases and ultimately will result in an additional useable water supply of 15,000 acre feet. The use of the nonpotable water for irrigation and industrial customers will free potable water supplies for up to 30,000 homes. 
Construction will include a treatment plant and a distribution system that is separate from the potable water system. Phase I will serve customers in the vicinity of the reuse plant, including a Public Service Company power plant, other industrial users and other public areas. Phase II will add irrigation for parks and golf courses in the former Stapleton Airport and the recently closed Lowry Air Force Base redevelopment areas. The Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which is being converted to a national wildlife refuge, will also use the reuse water to maintain lake levels on-site and to provide water for wildlife habitats. Phase III will service existing parks as well as new development of a commercial corridor leading to the Denver International Airport. With the construction of Phase II, the irrigation, heating and cooling, and car washing facilities at Denver International Airport will convert to reuse water, where a dual distribution system has already been installed. 
This plan would benefit many Coloradans, and would help relieve many of the water burdens faced in the Denver region. Again, I'd like to thank Mayor Webb for his support, and I am hopeful this bill can be quickly passed and put into effect.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1998. 
Every day millions of senior citizens and other innocent consumers receive sweepstakes announcements that boldly announce that they have just won millions of dollars or some other prize, perhaps a luxury cruise, when in fact they have not. Millions of Americans also receive cashier's check look-alikes, made out to their name, and written for thousands of dollars, as a ploy to get them to purchase some product or service. But upon close scrutiny, these cashier's check look-alikes are actually worthless. 
These two tactics are some of the most pervasive deceptive direct mail marketing ploys being used today. Theses slick direct mail marketing ploys prey directly upon the better elements of the American character: optimism, good nature, trust, and natural tendency to accept things at face value. 
The recent increase of news reports detailing how American consumers are being deliberately misled into believing that they have just won a huge prize, only to find out later that they were taken advantage of, clearly shows that the problem is getting worse. All across our country, families' home mail boxes are being stuffed with increasingly deceptive direct mail marketing ploys, and senior citizens are particulary vulnerable to these deceptive tactics. 
Something needs to be done to restore honesty in sweepstakes. 
This legislation has two key provisions. The first ensures accuracy and honesty in direct mail sales promotions that use sweepstakes or other games of chance to entice consumers to buy their products or services. The second provision promotes honest forthrightness when cashier's check look-alikes are used in direct mail sales promotions. Together, this legislation's two key provisions will benefit American consumers, the U.S. Postal Service, and the direct mail marketing industry. 
First, my bill will protect American consumers from deceptive marketing practices. It will accomplish this by requiring that direct mail marketers provide consumers with honest, up-front and clear disclosure of what is being sent to their mail boxes. These new disclosure standards will enable consumers to quicky separate mail that is truly important from mail that is deceptively designed to look important by masquerading as something that it is not. 
Second, the bill helps the Postal Service do its job better. This bill will strengthen the Postal Service's efforts by enabling it to halt the delivery of deceptive mass mailings. This legislation will reassure the American people that the Postal Service is on their side, and not on the side of those who would use the Postal Service to deliver deceptive marketing ploys. 
Finally, this legislation will benefit the direct mail marketing industry as a whole. It will enhance the public image of the majority of direct mail marketers that are honest by compelling companies that use deceptive marketing practices, and whose activities taint the entire industry, to either clean up their act or get out. For many years, direct mail marketers have successfully sold their products without resorting to deception. Let's return to those days. 
The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act is built on a solid foundation of precedents. The key principle for the sweepstakes portion of this legislation is based on the way in which lotteries clearly disclose important information, like the total chances of winning. As for achieving the same goal for the printed materials used in direct mail marketing, this honesty is achieved through requiring the disclosure to be printed on top and in easy to read font sizes. It is also similar to food labeling, letting you know what is inside the product. The cashier's check look-alike portion of this bill is founded on precedent in current law that allows the Postal Service to dispose of, or otherwise refuse to deliver, government look-alike materials. My bill simply expands this current statutory provision to include cashier's check look-alikes. 
This bill addresses deceptive sweepstakes in two important ways. First, it requires an announcement to be clearly printed on the face of the envelope to state that `This is a sweepstakes. You have not automatically won.' This announcement must be clearly printed in a large 16 point font, or in an even larger font in some circumstances, so that it is crystal clear and easy for everyone to read. Many of our nation's seniors will especially benefit from this large font size requirement. Second, this bill requires that important information be printed clearly on the top of the first page of enclosed material, including the chances of winning the big prize being promoted and that no purchase is necessary to participate. For cashier check look-alikes, this bill calls for a 16 point font notice that `This is not a check. This has no cash value.' The days of deceptive marketers burying all of the important information and other disclaimers in fine print are numbered. 
Enforcement is triggered by the consumers themselves. When people receive sweepstakes and cashier's check look-alikes that do not meet the honesty guidelines laid out in this bill, they should contact the Post Office and register a complaint. These consumer complaints can then trigger a postal investigation of the materials in question. If the Postal Service finds that the materials do not live up to the Honesty in Sweepstakes guidelines, the Postal Service can then dispose of the mail accordingly, either by disposing of it or returning it to the sender. As a result, marketers who are not complying with the Honesty in Sweepstakes standards will then take a loss on the production and postage costs associated with that mailing. Needless to say, the company will quickly learn its lesson and produce marketing materials that are more forthright and honest. 
I have consulted with the Attorneys General of both my home state of Colorado, and of the state of Florida, which is in the forefront of the effort to fight deceptive sweepstakes practices. These two offices expressed support for both this bill's goals and new approach. The Attorneys General were also glad to hear that this bill contains a clause stating that nothing in this bill will preempt state law. This important clause gives each of our respective states the freedom to enact its own additional guidelines as it sees fit. I appreciate the helpful feedback and support these two states' Attorneys General have shown. 
For too long, too many of our senior citizens and other innocent consumers have been victimized by deceptive sweepstakes and cashier's check look-alikes. This bill will end this practice, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to transfer the title to the Vallecito Reservoir in southwestern Colorado to the Pine River Irrigation District. This transfer has been developed after close consultation and extensive meetings with the Pine River Irrigation District, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Forest Service and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. 
This bill contributes toward my ongoing goal of developing local cooperation and control of public resources, while addressing the concerns of managing site-specific resources, recreation, and environmental protection. It fits with my long-held belief that we need to downsize the role of the Federal Government, while allowing the State and local entities which are most affected to manage valuable resources. 
For the past twenty-five years, the District has managed the Vallecito Reservoir for the Bureau of Reclamation. This bill will allow the District, which has developed extensive expertise and knowledge, to purchase the reservoir which they manage. The concerns of the public are addressed through provisions which require certain conditions be met before the title can be transferred. Once the transfer is complete the Pine River District will continue to manage the reservoir in compliance with State and Federal law. 
This bill is a companion bill to H.R. 3715 introduced in the House of Representatives by our colleague Congressman Scott McInnis. The House already has held a hearing on this legislation. Therefore, I am hopeful that the Senate can move rapidly to complete this transfer.

 Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to note the inclusion in the Inter-modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA) of key provisions to provide increased funding for Indian roads, highways, and bridges; to provide for the allocation of scarce ISTEA dollars for Indian tribes pursuant to a flexible negotiated rule-making procedure; and to ensure that all ISTEA funds will be made available to tribes that choose to enter contracts under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975, P.L. 93-638. 
These provisions are critical because they recognize the high level of unfunded infrastructure needs in Indian country, and respect Indian tribal authority and capacity to administer ISTEA dollars in ways that are tailored to unique local conditions and needs. These provisions will assist tribes in attracting and retaining investment and job-creating activities to Indian reservations. There are many reasons why it is imperative that Indian tribes foster vigorous economies. In 1996, Congress enacted a reform of the welfare system that requires able-bodied Americans to be industrious and look first to themselves, not the government, for help and hope. That law is now being implemented across the country. 
Most reservation economies are heavily reliant on federal transfer payments. Most Americans have read about the grinding poverty most Indian people face: high unemployment, lack of decent housing, and poor health, alcoholism, diabetes, cancer, and a staggering suicide rate. 
The success of the welfare reform law depends on the availability of jobs that can take the place of transfer payments and government assistance. In Indian country, with a national unemployment rate of 52%, job opportunities are scarce. There is a role for the federal government in helping Indian communities make the transition from dependence to self-reliance. Employment training, removing barriers to lending, and increasing Indian entrepreneurship are essential if tribes are to be successful in creating jobs. By far the most important is in fostering relationships with the private sector, which requires a solid physical infrastructure which can support business needs. 
In an economy increasingly reliant on global opportunities, tribes must be competitive. There are many investment opportunities, and other things being equal, tribal economies without basic infrastructure are not as attractive as those that can provide the amenities necessary for successful ventures. I am very pleased to have supported these provisions and am committed to building a solid private sector in Indian country, creating job opportunities for Indian people, and lessening dependence on the federal government. 
Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the testimony of the Honorable Bobby Whitefeather, Chairman of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, and Mr. John Sunchild, Executive Director of the National Tribal Development Association, regarding reservation infrastructure needs and economic development which was submitted to the Committee on Indian Affairs as providing key insights into the infrastructure problem in Indian country.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Tribal Conflict Resolution, Tort Claims and Risk Management Act of 1998 to continue the discourse on matters involving Indian tribal governments such as providing a mechanism for the collection of legitimate state retail sales taxes and affording a remedy to those persons injured by the acts of tribal governments, or those acting on their behalf. 
By introducing this legislation, I am hopeful that tribal leaders, concerned parties, and those affected by the actions of tribal governments can find some common ground and craft innovative solutions to these issues which I believe will continue to hamper Indian tribes unless dealt with appropriately. 
It has been said that because of Indian tribal immunity from lawsuits, states have no enforcement mechanism to collect state retail taxes on transactions made to non-members. Similarly, opponents of tribal immunity charge that tribal immunity prevents injured persons from seeking legal recourse for their injuries. 
The Supreme Court has held that on retail sales made to non-members, Indian tribes are under a duty to collect and remit such state taxes. The Court made it clear that there are numerous remedies available to the states in such situations including suits against tribal officials; levying the tax at the wholesale level before goods enter reservation commerce; negotiating agreements with the tribes involved; and if these prove unworkable, then seeking congressional action. 
At least 18 states and numerous tribes have chosen the negotiations route to settling their differences short of litigation and acrimony. Testimony presented to the committee on March 11, 1998, revealed that there are approximately 200 intergovernmental agreements between Indian tribes and states providing for the collection and remittance by the tribes of state sales taxes on sales made to non-members. 
Rather than waive the immunity of all tribes--those who have chosen to deal with the issue of taxation through agreement and those who have not--the legislation I introduce today declares the policy of the United States to be the reaffirmation of the federal obligation to protect Indian tribes, people, and trust resources and property of Indian tribes. In fulfilling that obligation, the United States should make available the framework and machinery for the amicable settlement and resolution of disputes, including tax matters, involving states and Indian tribes. 
The achievement of mutual agreements is the major objective of this bill, and in addition to encouraging such agreements, this legislation provides for the creation of an `Intergovernmental Alternative Dispute Resolution Panel' to consider and render decisions on tax matters that cannot be resolved through negotiation. 
The panel will be composed of a five member team including representatives of the Departments of Interior, Justice, and Treasury; one representative of state governments; and one representative of tribal 
governments. Rather than create a `new' mediation framework, this bill relies on the existing Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to provide mediation services for such situations. 
Title II of the bill is intended to provide a remedy in tort situations for those tribes that are not covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act, or covered by private secured liability insurance. 
This title would require the Secretary of Interior to obtain or provide tort liability insurance or equivalent coverage for each Indian tribe that receives tribal priority allocations from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
Because many, if not most, Indian tribes maintain some type of insurance coverage, the Secretary is obligated to determine the type and adequacy of coverage already provided in order to avoid duplicative or redundant coverage. 
Significantly, and as is the case with insurance policies now in place for many tribal governments, the policy of insurance must contain a provision prohibiting the carrier from raising the defense of sovereign immunity with respect to any tort action filed involving the tribe. In this way, injured persons would be afforded a remedy. Such policies would also contain a provision precluding any waiver for pre-judgment interest or punitive damages. 
The Secretary would prescribe regulations governing the amount and nature of claims covered by such insurance policy, and would also set a schedule of premiums payable by any tribe that is provided insurance under this bill. 
Lastly, as Indian tribes have begun to re-develop their economies and are beginning to assert their influence, issues and matters have developed that should receive the attention of a full-time, intergovernmental body to review and analyze such situations. 
This legislation creates the `Joint Tribal-Federal-State Commission on Intergovernmental Affairs' to thoughtfully and deliberately consider matters such as law enforcement, civil and criminal jurisdiction, taxation, transportation, economic development, and related issues. Two years after enactment, the commission is required to submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the President, the Committee on Indian Affairs in the Senate, and the Committee on Resources in the House of Representatives. 
Finally, let me say that I do not agree with those who suggest that the doctrine of tribal sovereign immunity is an anachronism and one no longer deserving of protection. Several of the states, as well as the federal government, have chosen to waive their immunity from suit in very limited circumstances and under strict conditions. 
It is simply inaccurate to suggest that tribal governments are the last repository of immunity. Whether by limiting damage awards as some states have done, or eliminating entire classes of activities that will not trigger immunity waivers as the federal government has done in the Federal Tort Claims Act, the doctrine of immunity is alive and well in the United States. 
That there are issues that need to be dealt with I agree; that the way to address these issues is through involuntary, broad-based waivers of immunity, I disagree heartily. I call on the quiet, thoughtful, and reasonable people on both sides of these issues to craft solutions that respects Indian tribal governments and yet provides reasonable solutions for legitimate problems that do exist.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as a strong supporter of American public lands and private property rights, I am concerned about the setting aside of public lands by the federal government for international agreements and oversight. The absence of congressional oversight in such programs as the United Nations Biosphere Reserve is of special concern to me. The United Nations has designated 47 `Biosphere Reserves' in the United States which contain a total area greater than the size of my home state of Colorado. That is why today I introduce companion legislation to H.R. 901, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act, introduced by Representative Don Young, to preserve American sovereignty and halt the extension of the executive branch into congressional constitutional authority. 
We are facing a threat to our sovereignty by the creation of these land reserves in our public lands. I also believe the rights of private landowners must be protected if these international land designations are made. Even more disturbing is the fact the executive branch elected to be a party to this `Biosphere Reserve' program without the approval of Congress or the American people. The absence of congressional oversight in this area is a serious concern. 
In fact most of these international land reserves have been created with minimal, if any, congressional input or oversight or public consultation. Congress must protect individual property owners, local communities, and State sovereignty which may be adversely impacted economically by any such international agreements. 
The current system for implementing international land reserves diminishes the power and sovereignty of the Congress to exercise its constitutional power to make laws that govern lands belonging to the United States. The executive branch may be indirectly agreeing to terms of international treaties, such as the Convention of Biodiversity, to which the United States is not a party, and one which our country has refused to ratify. 
A `Biosphere Reserve' is a federally-zoned and coordinated region that could prohibit certain uses of private lands outside of the designated international area. The executive branch is agreeing to manage the designated area in accordance with an underlying agreement which may have implications on non-federal land outside the affected area. When residents of Arkansas discovered a plan by the United Nations and the administration to advance a proposed `Ozark Highland Man and Biosphere Reserve' without public input, the plan was withdrawn in the face of public pressure. This type of stealth tactic to accommodate international interests does not serve the needs and desires of the American people. Rather, it is an encroachment by the Executive branch on congressional authority. 
As policymaking authority is further centralized at the executive branch level, the role of ordinary citizens in the making of this policy through their elected representatives is diminished. The administration has allowed some of America's most symbolic monuments of freedom, such as the Statue of Liberty and Independence Hall to be listed as World Heritage Sites. Furthermore the United Nations has listed national parks including Yellowstone National Park--our nation's first national park. 
Federal legislation is needed to require the specific approval of Congress before any area within the borders of United States is made part of an international land reserve. My bill reasserts Congress' constitutional role in the creation of rules and regulations governing lands belonging to the United States and its people.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Counterfeiting Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1998. My bill would tighten the sentencing guidelines' base offense level in recognition of the fact that advances in computer and printing technology have fundamentally changed the nature of counterfeiting. This bill would bring our nation's counterfeiting laws out of Gutenberg's printing press era and into the modern computer age. 
Counterfeiting of our nation's currency is a serious and growing problem. Incidents of computer generated counterfeiting have increased dramatically over the last three years. In 1995 only one half of one percent of counterfeit U.S. currency passed were computer generated. 
Today, just three short years later, computer generated counterfeits account for approximately 43 percent of the counterfeits passed. 
Traditional counterfeiters use offset printing production methods that require specialized equipment including printing presses, engraved printing press plates and green ink. These counterfeiters encounter a cumbersome process that is messy, is harder to conceal, and requires them to produce in large batches. 
However, a rapidly growing number of today's counterfeiters are using personal computers, scanners, digital imaging software, full color copiers, and laser and inkjet printers. They can also use the Internet to instantaneously transmit the computer images needed for counterfeiting. This technology, which is readily available and increasingly affordable, enables criminals to produce high-quality counterfeit currency in small batches and at a low cost. It is this ability for counterfeiters to easily produce in small batches that has rendered our sentencing guidelines outdated and less effective as a deterrent. 
Our sentencing guidelines under current law are based in a world where the realities of offset printing required counterfeiters to produce in rather large batches. That reality no longer exists. Basically, the more counterfeit currency a counterfeiter got caught with, the stiffer the sentence. Using computer technology, today's counterfeiters can simply print out smaller batches of counterfeit currency whenever they want to. This allows these criminals to effectively fly just under the radar of our sentencing guideline thresholds. 
The administration recently acknowledged the extent of the problem. In a March 5, 1998, letter to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin wrote that `increases in computer counterfeiting cases represent not only a threat to our law enforcement 
interests, but also seriously threaten the integrity of our U.S. currency. Maintaining the stability and integrity of U.S. currency is essential to preserving the benefits derived from the dollar's status as a world currency.' 
In response to these enhanced counterfeiting techniques, the Department of Treasury has been redesigning our nation's currency to make it harder to counterfeit. In addition the Secret Service has stepped up its battle against counterfeiters, both at home and abroad. But more needs to be done. This bill is another important step to toughen the penalties for counterfeiting. 
Specifically, my bill strengthens the sentencing guidelines so that increases are based on offense levels determined by the amount of counterfeit bills produced and a point system based on the offender's prior criminal history. Under current law, the base offense begins with level 9 for convictions involving $2,000 in counterfeit currency or less. Increases in this level occur according to the amount of counterfeit bills over $2,000. Thus a defendant's guideline range in counterfeiting cases depends largely on the amount of counterfeit inventory seized when the operation is shut down. 
Increases in sentencing are also determined by the prior criminal history of the offender. Points are added for such things as: prior imprisonment; offenses committed while on probation, parole, or supervised release; offenses committed less than two years from prior release; and other misdemeanor and petty offenses. 
Under current law at base offense level 9, seven points are needed for the imposition of a prison sentence of 12 to 18 months. Without these points for prior criminal history many offenders simply are being released on probation. I believe these sentencing guidelines are too lenient and fail to address the growing problem of counterfeiting. 
Therefore, my bill increases the base offense level in section 2B5.1 of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines by not less than two levels to level 11. Under my bill, an offender would need only four points to receive the same 12 to 18 month sentence which previously required seven points. This relates to all counterfeiting offenses to address the overall harm counterfeiting can have on the integrity of U.S. currency. 
Second, my bill adds a sentencing enhancement of not less than two levels for counterfeiting offenses that involve the use of computer printer or a color photocopying machine. This would place this new class of computer counterfeiters at an offense level of 13. Here, an offender would need zero points to receive the same 12 to 18 month sentence. The increase in my bill would provide for actual prison sentences in many of the cases where previous offenders were only receiving probation. I believe this legislation clearly addresses our growing problem with counterfeiters by imposing stricter sentencing penalties. 
Mr. President, counterfeiting threatens the very underpinnings of our economy, the American people's confidence in the integrity and value of our nation's currency, the U.S. dollar. The `Counterfeiting Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1998' will send a clear message to criminals who are even thinking about counterfeiting. I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, on March 11, 1998, the Senate passed S. 1605, the Bulletproof Vest and Partnership Grant Act of 1998 which I introduced along with my colleagues Senators Leahy and Hatch. On May 12, 1998, with strong bipartisan support, the House passed this bill and with mutually agreed upon modifications. Today, the Senate is about to pass this legislation by a unanimous vote and send it to the President for signature and enactment into law. I wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the Committee's ranking member Senator Leahy, for their help and support with this important legislation. 
Two nights ago, on Wednesday, May 13, 1998, in observance of National Police Week, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund held the Tenth Annual Memorial Candlelight Vigil and Reception honoring the fallen men and women in the line of duty. My heart goes out to the families and friends of these men and women and I am proud to be a part of a potential solution to this tragedy that faces police officers in the line of duty. 
This legislation is endorsed by 38 Attorneys General, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the International Union of Police Associations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Associations of Police Organizations. They know this legislation will benefit police and sheriffs' departments around the country. 
There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our streets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against violent criminals. 
As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our communities. 
Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and deadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and local officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests. Unfortunately, many police departments just do not have the resources to purchase vests on their own. 
The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most important pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can have. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives of more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers who do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed by a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, bulletproof vests save lives. 
This Friday afternoon, at the 17th annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, the families, friends and colleagues of police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty this past year will gather on the West Front of the Capitol to remember the courage and sacrifice of their fallen loved ones. 
This heartfelt ceremony marks the climax of National Police Week here in Washington, DC. A perfect way to show tribute to these fallen men and women is through passage of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 by both houses of Congress. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 will form a partnership with state and local law enforcement agencies in order to make sure that police officers who need bulletproof vests get one. It will do so by authorizing up to $25 million per year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. The program will provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor. To ensure that the funding goes first to those police departments which need it most, the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is given discretion to give preferential consideration to smaller departments whose budgets are scarce. 
Additionally, those jurisdictions which do not receive any funding under the local law enforcement block grant program will be given preference. Furthermore, at least half of the funds available under this program will be awarded to jurisdictions with less than 100,000 residents. 
While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a career in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure that officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a vest. Body armor often means the difference between life and death.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to express my support for the Consumer Anti-Slamming Act, S. 1618, which addresses the unauthorized switching of telephone service carriers by competing service providers. This abusive practice has become an increasing problem in my home state of Colorado where slamming has grown at an alarming rate. Last October, Chairman Burns of the Communications Subcommittee of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held a field hearing in Denver on this issue. In addition to this hearing, anti-slamming legislation has recently passed the Colorado State Legislature. With Colorado as one of the nation's top five states in complaints-per-million customers, I intend to vote for this anti-slamming legislation. 
I also am pleased that S. 1618 incorporates provisions from my Anti-Slamming Bill, S. 1051 which I introduced on July 22, 1997. This language requires that the FCC annually report to Congress the `Top Ten' slammers for each year, as well as carriers assessed fines or penalties during the same period. The `Top Ten' list identifies those carriers subject to the highest number of subscriber slamming complaints compared to the total number of subscribers they serve. This ratio approach ensures that large companies are not automatically singled out by virtue of having a large customer base. The focus of my `Top Ten' amendment is on those companies with the highest percentage of slamming complaints relative to their total customer base. 
This `Top Ten' list will give Congress an annual opportunity to review and publicly comment on this serious problem known as `slamming'. I am convinced that this approach coupled with the language in S. 1618, will prove valuable in deterring carriers from engaging in illegal tactics.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, after much consideration of the pending resolution of ratification to expand NATO, I intend to vote in favor of this resolution. It is in the national security interest of the United States and our allies. But, as the Senate continues this historic debate on the expansion of the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, I would like to make some observations about the cost implications of expanding NATO and steps we have taken in the Senate to address them. 
When the Senate committees began to consider NATO expansion last year, I was skeptical. The Senate, I feared, was approaching this issue with insufficient information or appreciation for the costs of such expansion for the American taxpayer. 
That is why I joined with our colleague from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, on a letter of June 25, 1997, to the President requesting specific facts and analysis regarding the cost and military implications of NATO expansion. 
I continued to pursue the cost issue last October, when the Senate Appropriations Committee held a series of hearings on this important issue. On the first day, the committee heard about the policy implications of NATO expansion from Defense Secretary Cohen and Secretary of State Albright. The next day, the committee heard about the military implications from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. European Command, General Clark. 
What came out of both days of hearings was the fact that no definitive estimates existed for the true costs of NATO expansion. 
The committee heard how the original Defense Department estimates may have been inflated because they took into account a fourth country, rather than only those three currently invited to join NATO. Those estimates also considered a greater Russian threat than actually existed because of that country's recent reductions in force. The generals testified that, first, specific military requirements will be developed; then, NATO will determine the costs for meeting those requirements. 
The third day of those hearings was critical. On October 23, 1997, I asked a witness from the General Accounting Office to provide for the Committee a definitive analysis of the cost of this expansion. During that hearing, I expressed my concern that no official estimates yet existed about what the U.S. contribution will be to an expanded NATO. IN fact, the title of the GAO report summed it up--`Cost Implications for the United States Remain Unclear.' 
The hearing also revealed that the GAO cost estimates lacked critical information, such as the $60 million in bilateral aid which the U.S. had already provided the three invited countries. In response to my question, the GAO conceded the $60 million was American taxpayers' money and should be counted. 
Ultimately, I was informed that an accurate projection could not be provided for some months. 
Then in February of this year, the administration provided much lower figures for the U.S. share of NATO expansion--approximately $40 million each year over the next 10 years. This estimate stood in stark contrast to the much larger figures that had been quoted just months before. 
Because of my concerns about the unpredictability of future expansion costs, I joined the Chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, on his amendments as an original cosponsor. The Senate adopted these amendments earlier this evening. They establish limits on the U.S. share of the common NATO budget and ensure Congress has the necessary authority to keep close watch over these costs in the future years of expansion.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Before I close, I want to recognize the work of our former distinguished colleague in this body from the State of Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, who is one of this country's most ardent supporters of NATO expansion. Few have played a more crucial or steadfast role in the effort to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in the NATO alliance. His outstanding work will have a lasting impact. 
After much consideration of the cost and military implications of the pending resolution of ratification to expand NATO, I intend to vote in favor of this resolution. It is in the national security interest of the United States and our allies.  
Exhibit 1 Warsaw, February 28, 1998 
Hon. Mr. Trent Lott, Senate Republican Majority Leaders, 
Hon. Mr. Tom Daschle, Senate Democratic Minority Leader, Washington, DC. 
Distinguished Senators: The Senate of the United States of America will soon vote on NATO enlargement with respect to Czech, Hungarian and Polish membership. It will be an important political decision with particular implications for the security of many nations, especially of those from Central and Eastern Europe. 
Decisions of the member state of the North Atlantic Alliance and the United States' decision particularly, will provide our region, which suffered so much in the XXth century, with stability, security and lasting democratic order. 
As leaders of all parliamentary caucuses in the Polish Parliament--those ruling as well as in the opposition--we assure you, Honorable Senators, that this question of Polish membership in NATO is vital for security of the Euroatlantic region and enjoys overwhelming support in our society. 
Poland as a future member of NATO would like to be not only a security consumer but also a security provider. At the same time, we are determined to fulfill all necessary Alliance obligations--including financial ones. 
It is our hope that the United States Senate will meet the expectations of millions of Poles and will give consent and advice to the President of the United States to ratify the Protocolls of Accession. 
We address ourselves to you, as American Statesmen, to use your authority to assure the successful outcome of the Senate vote on NATO enlargement. 
We remain, respectfully yours,

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today we are voting on the FY 1998 Supplementary Appropriations bill which contains very important disaster relief and funding for our military operations overseas. 
In this bill before us, Congress funds emergency disaster relief for El NinAE6o related storms on both coasts and in the southeast. We also provide important funding for our military personnel in Bosnia. Although I have been on record consistently opposing our continued presence in Bosnia, I support our military men and women while they are there. This bill provides that important support. 
This appropriations bill also funds our military mission in Iraq. While I am skeptical of the dubious and undefined U.S. plan in this region, I again vote to make sure our military personnel serving our country there are well equipped and defended. This bill provides this assurance. 
This bill also provides some important local relief for Colorado. This legislation contains language to assist the City of Boulder. Boulder needs to replace a water pipeline that crosses Forest Service lands. The language in the bill provides assurance that Boulder does not abandon its original easement when it agrees with the Forest Service to relocate the pipeline. 
This bill also contains important relief for the National Forests in northern Colorado. Recently, a unique meteorological situation occurred in Routt County, near Steamboat Springs, called a blowdown. A blowdown is exactly that--winds of such terrific and concentrated force blew down almost every tree in the region. It looked as though a large nuclear bomb was detonated above. This devastating disaster affected 20,000 acres of land, almost all which was on national forest land and was the largest such blowdown ever recorded in the Rocky Mountains. 
Part of the $10 million appropriated by this bill to the National Forest System would support the cleanup efforts in the Routt National Forest in Colorado. This would assist the local communities which rely on the natural resources of the Routt National Forest for tourism, recreation, agriculture, and timber can get back to normal. Not only will this help economies of the local communities, but it is vital for the health of the Routt National Forest and the Mt. Zirkel Wilderness Area. 
This funding will allow the Forest Service to establish a timber salvage plan for the responsible harvest of the downed timber and maintain the roads that will be necessary for this to take place. While the prospect of a timber sale may seem objectionable to some people, I believe the responsible harvest of this timber in the national forest is preferential to the chance a natural or accidental forest fire might occur there.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a measure to help Indians and tribal businesses foster entrepreneurship and vigorous reservation economies. Indian tribes face many challenges, but the greatest priority is in building stronger economies and providing jobs to tribal members. With this bill, I intend to unshackle Indian entrepreneurship to provide jobs and revenues for reservation economies. 
When the Europeans landed in the New World to explore and build settlements, they were greeted by Native people with a long tradition of inter-tribal and regional trade. The tribes traded pelts and furs, hand-woven baskets, blankets, virtually limitless arts and crafts, weapons, and a variety of Native grown and gathered foods. 
Unrestrained by bureaucrats and free to roam their own lands, the tribes enjoyed a standard of material well-being that, while not ideal, was a far cry from the Third World conditions most Indian people live in today. 
Over the course of 200 years this tradition has been replaced by rules and regulations that continue to stifle Indian entrepreneurship and instead promise cradle-to-grave `security' based on federal transfer payments. The practical results of federal domination is predictable: lifeless reservation economies and the absence of a private sector to create wealth and sustain employment for Indian people. 
The current statistical profile of Indian people is poor and shows little sign of improvement. Despite the popular belief that gaming has made millionaires of all Indians, the reality is otherwise as most Indian gaming revenues are more like church bingo than like Las Vegas or Atlantic City. 
In the Great Depression, the national unemployment rate was 20 percent and it was called a `national crisis.' Indian country has an unemployment rate running at 50 percent, and there are no comments, no sense of urgency and little attention being paid. 
There are other reasons job opportunities are needed. In 1996, the Congress enacted a welfare reform law that provides transition assistance to welfare recipients and rightly requires able-bodied Americans to get and keep jobs. In rural areas, particularly on Indian reservations, the welfare reform will hit hard because employment opportunities are scarce. 
The goal of this and future efforts is to increase value-added activities on reservations in such fields as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, livestock and fisheries, high technology, arts and crafts, and a host of service industries. 
The United States has the responsibility to preserve, protect and maximize tribal assets and resources, and an obligation to improve the standards of living of Indian people. In this legislation, that responsibility is primarily in removing the barriers to success the federal government itself has created over the years. 
The bill aims to make best use of and streamline existing programs to provide the necessary tools to enable tribes to attract outside capital and technical expertise. This model has proven highly successful in the self governance arena and in the Indian job training program, known as the `477' program. The bill would provide better coordination of existing business development programs in the Commerce Department and maximize the resources made available to tribes. 
The tribes have a responsibility as well. As a matter of Indian self determination, the tribes are increasingly administering federal services, programs, and activities in lieu of the federal government. This has led to more capable and accountable tribal governments. A fundamental precept of self-government is a reduction in the dependence on the federal bureaucracy and federal funds and by assuming a greater role in funding their own self government. 
The Committee on Indian Affairs recently held a hearing on economic development and one of the findings was that the tribes need to provide governance infrastructure and friendly business environments if they want to attract and retain investment. Whether by adopting commercial codes, or tribal courts that can address business issues, or regulations that do not repel the private sector, tribal efforts are critical if this effort is to succeed. 
Under the bill, the Native American Business Development Office in the Commerce Department will coordinate existing programs, including those for international business and tourism, aimed at development on Indian lands. This bill does not create any new programs but rather is intended to achieve more efficiency in those that already exist within existing budget authority. The bill also prohibits assistance under the act from being used for gaming on Indian lands. 
In addition, the bill directs the Secretary to create a task force on regulatory reform and business development to analyze existing laws and regulations that are restraining business and economic development on Indian lands. Again, the bill is not intended to create a new entity, but recognizes that there is great need to strip away the layers of unnecessary rules and regulations that stifle Indian businesses. 
I urge those that are critical of Indian gaming to join me in providing alternatives to build strong and diversified tribal economies for the benefit of tribes, tribal members, and surrounding communities.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the `International Monetary Fund Transparency and Efficiency Act of 1998.' When bailing out failing economies, the International Monetary Fund often requires countries to make their markets more transparent, efficient and accountable. In the wake of the Asian economic crisis, it has become clear that the IMF itself also sorely needs the very same increased transparency, efficiency, and accountability that the IMF demands of others. 
I am pleased to be joined today by my colleagues from North Carolina and Alabama, Senators Faircloth and Shelby, who are original cosponsors of this legislation. 
On March 17, 1998, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved S. 1769, which would provide Supplemental Appropriations for the IMF for Fiscal Year 1998. Although I voted against the amendment which would provide $18 billion to bail out the IMF, the Senate ultimately adopted this amendment. While S. 1769 contains a few provisions calling for IMF reforms, like increased transparency and calling on countries receiving IMF loans to end market distorting government subsidies, S. 1769 contains much weaker enforcement mechanisms than those contained in the bill I am introducing today. Also, S. 1769 does not curtail the IMF's subsidized interest rates, something this bill will do. 
Just last week, the IMF itself freely admitted the need for increased openness and accountability. On April 14, 1998, on the eve of the IMF's annual spring meeting, Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, promised more openness and accountability at the IMF. Furthermore, during a National Journal interview earlier this month, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was quoted as saying, `Equally, we cannot be satisfied with the IMF that we now have. And that is why it is important to build consensus as rapidly as possible on efforts to make the IMF a more transparent institution.' I believe the American taxpayers deserve no less. 
We in Congress must act to ensure that just such IMF reforms become reality. By sending the IMF's established hierarchy a clear and immediate reason to implement these reforms we will ensure that these long overdue reforms will actually take place. 
This legislation is also timely. When the IMF bails out failing economies, it regularly calls for increased transparency and governmental efficiency as a precondition for receiving financial aid. The IMF is right on target in this respect. Increased transparency and accountability are crucial to give the American taxpayers reasonable assurances that the problems that cause these economic breakdowns are being directly addressed. Obviously, if these troubled economies had been transparent, efficient and open to American exports from the start, Congress would not be debating about making another $18 billion available to the IMF. Clearly, the IMF itself should live up to the standards it sets for others. 
This legislation would withhold U.S. federal funding from the IMF until the Treasury Secretary certifies that the IMF has met four specific reform requirements, and then Congress enacts a joint resolution approving this certification. 
First, the IMF would be required to make the minutes of its board of Governors or Executive Board available for public inspection within three months of the meeting. Second, the IMF would release copies of loan and program documents, written reviews, and other pertinent documents related to proposed and ongoing programs within three months. Third, the IMF would establish an independent board to review the IMF's operations, research and loan activities and then issue annual reports for public inspection. Finally, when granting financial assistance, the IMF would charge interest rates that are comparable to market interest rates rather than the subsidized interest rates it currently charges. Naturally, this bill includes special exemptions to protect classified U.S. information, information which would disrupt markets, and proprietary information. 
The administration and IMF have requested that the American taxpayers make an additional $18 billion of their hard-earned dollars available to the IMF to replenish its fund that has been depleted by the Asian financial crisis. My bill will bring accountability to an institution, funded in large part by the American people that has--for the last 50 years--eluded true accountability. Increased transparency and efficiency will finally enable the American taxpayers to clearly see how their tax dollars are being used by the IMF.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as our nation approaches the Millennium, it is an appropriate time to renew the appreciation and understanding of the American people in the democratic heritage and principles which make our country the greatest in the world. That is why I am introducing legislation today to rename Election Day as Freedom and Democracy Day and to renew civic responsibility. 
The two main objectives of this legislation are first, to broaden and increase voter turnout, and second, to restore appreciation for our country's most fundamental expression of freedom and its democratic underpinnings--the right to vote. As a nation, we must all be concerned that voter apathy is so high, while voter participation is so low. Voting, it seems, has become a neglected, if not cumbersome, privilege of Americans. In the past 20 years, voter participation in presidential election years has remained barely above 50 percent, and during midterm congressional election years it has not been more than 50 percent. 
I am alarmed at the unfortunate fact that voter participation has declined to the point that it is now among the lowest of any democratic nation. The rate of voter participation among younger Americans--the future leaders, teachers, and business executives--has declined significantly. It is our responsibility as elected officials, and, more importantly, as American citizens, to support additional efforts to strengthen the electoral process, to encourage civic awareness, and to promote active participation in the exercise of liberty. 
Therefore, the first goal of the bill is to renew civic spirit and highlight the importance of Americans to fulfill their civic responsibilities by making Election Day a legal public holiday, known as Freedom and Democracy Day. This designation gives new meaning to the importance of voting on the first Tuesday in November. We need to stress the importance of self-government, encourage Americans to exercise their freedom and liberty as citizens by voting, and encourage Americans to reinvigorate their support for their civic duties. 
Although my bill designates this day as a legal public holiday, I want to emphasize that Freedom and Democracy Day will remain a regular workday. The bill specifically does not reference statutes relating to pay and leave of federal employees, and it does not affect the regular operations of the federal government. 
We as legislators and as citizens should do more to promote voter turnout and increase understanding of the value and importance of the right to vote. That is why the second objective of this bill is to encourage communities, schools, civic organizations, charitable organizations, companies, radio and television broadcasters, and public officials at all levels of government to support and celebrate Freedom and Democracy Day. The legislation encourages these key segments of society to sponsor and publicize appropriate celebrations and events which stress the importance of participation in self government. Their programs and support will send a strong message that the legitimacy of the democratic process is created from the consent of the governed, and voiced in the full participation of an informed, aware and active citizenry. 
I believe my bill provides a starting point for a renewed spirit and appreciation of freedom and democracy. It is my sincere hope that given more incentive to vote, more Americans will seize and exercise this expression of freedom. It is a small step in the overall effort to encourage all American citizens to take pride and participate in their representative system of government. 
Much of the voter apathy reflects many citizens' lack of faith in all levels of government. In America, power is supposed to be delegated from the citizen and loaned to the government. The Founding Fathers, who pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor for a new country, knew that as a nation we must leave room for change and growth and development. They knew the nation they left for us would modernize, rethink, and restructure. 
Let us be vigilant in remembering that the American idea of democracy is a government `of the people, by the people, for the people.' This is the idea of freedom and liberty; uniquely American. And, it is the goal of this bill to strengthen the American people's right to freedom and celebrate the spirit of democracy in the country which first empowered citizens with `certain unalienable rights.' 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be entered into the Record.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to make certain technical corrections to a number of unrelated laws affecting Indian tribes. 
I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. 
The bill will allow us to address a series of minor amendments to Indian laws in one piece of legislation, without having to introduce and legislate on a number of separate bills. 
I conferred with the delegation of each state involved on each of these amendments and the delegations generally support the respective amendment affecting tribes in their states. 
The bill contains a total of 14 amendments addressing a variety of issues including: increasing the allowable lease terms of reservation lands; reservation boundary adjustments; amendments to facilitate water rights settlements; clarification of federal service areas for tribes; and a number of others.

Mr. Campbell. Mr. President, Congress is beginning its annual process of writing a budget and appropriating funds. This is important work and gets a great deal of media coverage and public scrutiny. But I think we tend to get so caught up in this process that we forget some people in this country accomplish great things without a single dollar from Washington. 
One shining example is the Crazy Horse Memorial. The Ziolkowski family has worked for 50 years carving the image of the Oglala Sioux leader and his horse out of Thunder Mountain in South Dakota. They have relied entirely on private donations, twice turning down $10 million in federal funds. 
Today I am submitting a resolution recognizing the 50th anniversary of the memorial and the efforts of the Ziolkowski family. 
Crazy Hourse is a permanent fixture in our history as the man who led a force of Cheyenne and Oglala Sioux to victory over George Armstrong Custer at the Battle of Little Big Horn. thanks to the Ziolkowskis and their many benefactors, he will become a permanent fixture on our landscape as well. 
Korczak Ziolkowski began this task at the request of Sioux Indian Chief Henry Standing Bear, who said `My fellow chiefs and I would like the white man to know the red man has great heroes too.' Though Korczak passed away in 1982, the work is continue by his widow, Ruth, and seven of their children. The ambition behind this project is breathtaking. When complete, it will be the largest sculpture in the world. All four of the heads on Mount Rushmore could fit inside Crazy Horse's head. Future plans call for a university and a medical training center to be built at the base of the mountain. 
Mr. President, this resolution is about more than the dedication of the Ziolkowski family or the legacy of a great Indian leader. It honors the spirit of hard work and independence that make America the country it is. It honors all people who have followed a dream. I urge my colleagues to assist in its passage in time for the memorial's 50th anniversary on June 3, 1998.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend from West Virginia. I want to associate myself with his remarks. It is amazing to me how much we praise the actions of our military when they are putting their lives on the line and how quickly we forget them during peacetime or after they leave the military. This highway bill is important. I believe that, too, that our Nation's highways are in disrepair. But we have human beings that are also in disrepair in our veterans' ranks. We put $217 billion into the highway fund this year, which is almost $40 billion more than anybody expected. We have done a good job on funding our highways. I hope that we do an equally good job on funding the benefits for our sick veterans. 
As my colleague from West Virginia mentioned, the administration--I don't, frankly, think they understand the ramifications of this because when I was in the service, I can remember, as Senator Rockefeller alluded to, that there was no counseling not to smoke. In fact, as he said, it was `smoke 'em if you got 'em.' That was the common thing to do at virtually every break. We were told, `If you want to smoke, go ahead, do it.' There weren't any labels on the packs, and the cigarettes were free. You were actively encouraged to smoke. To say that it is somehow the veterans' fault and to say that they voluntarily smoked is a stretch of the imagination. I know we have potholes in our highways, but we ought to also be concerned with the bullet holes that were put in some of the veterans. To raid the veterans' health care funds to put it in the highways, I think, is absolutely outrageous. 
I want to associate myself with the comments of my colleague from West Virginia. I applaud him for his courageous stand on trying to protect the veterans of our Nation. 
I yield back my time.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, related to the procedures of the Secretary of the Interior in the Indian gaming statute. 
I oppose this amendment first and foremost because it will make permanent changes to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act without a single hearing on the matter. Later today I intend to introduce a freestanding bill to amend the Indian gaming statute. In fact, I was rather surprised this amendment would come forward on a bill that is designed to be an emergency supplemental for our troops in Bosnia and the gulf and to address natural disasters. 
Beginning this Wednesday, our committee will conduct the first of several hearings this year dealing with difficult and complex issues involving Indian gaming tribes and Indian gaming in itself. These issues include: Should there be uniform standards governing Indian gaming? What level of regulation of tribal gaming is needed? Is the Federal Gaming Commission adequately funded? What remedies do tribes have in the wake of the Supreme Court's Seminole decision? 
That is the committee of jurisdiction, and that is the forum through which the Senator from Wyoming should have addressed his concerns. 
When Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the States were invited to play a significant role in the regulation of gaming activities that take place on Indian lands. In fact, the statute required tribes to have a gaming compact before the State commenced any casino-style gaming within tribal lands. Though few have come to understand how significant such a provision is, it was and is a major concession by Indian tribes and one that has worked fairly well for the last 8 years. 
Congress also realized that tribes need a mechanism to encourage States to negotiate these compacts and provided for tribal lawsuits against reluctant States. Up until 1996, if a Federal court determined that a State was negotiating in bad faith, or if the State decided not to negotiate at all, the tribe had the option of filing a lawsuit to bring about good-faith negotiations. 
In 1996, the Supreme Court handed down the decision in Seminole Tribe of Indians v. The State of Florida. This decision said that a State may assert its 11th amendment immunity from lawsuits and preclude tribes from suing it in order to conclude a gaming agreement. Just as I believe we should respect each State's sovereign right, it seems to me we should recognize those of tribes, too. 
Next week at the committee hearing, one of the issues surely to arise again will be the matter of whether, in the absence of a State-tribal compact, the Secretary of the Interior can issue procedures to govern casino gaming on Indian lands. Senator Enzi's amendment would preempt the efforts of the committee to fully and fairly look at the issues regarding Indian gaming.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments of 1998 to reform the federal components of Indian gaming regulation. 
I wish to begin by acknowledging the work in this area by the two distinguished individuals who preceded me as the chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senators McCain and Inouye. This legislation builds upon their extraordinary efforts to listen to all sides of this debate and broker a fair and equitable compromise. I seek to continue this tradition by providing a starting point for negotiations among all of those with an interest in Indian gaming, and by addressing those areas that are most in need of immediate reform. 
This bill will revitalize the National Indian Gaming Commission, by ensuring that it has the authority to develop and impose a series of minimum federal standards on all Indian gaming operations. It will reform and restore the compact negotiation process by providing an alternative compact negotiation process in those instances where a state wishes to exercise its 11th Amendment immunity from lawsuits and its 10th Amendment right to decide for itself whether it wishes to regulate on-reservation gaming. Finally, this bill addresses the two issues that in my opinion are most in need of immediate reform. First, the bill applies the standard post-employment restrictions for former federal officials who are employed by any tribe that stood to benefit from any gaming-related decisions the officials made while they were federal employees. Second, the bill will prohibit the acquisition of off-reservation lands for gaming activities unless the tribe and the state agree to do so. 
Ten years ago the Congress enacted the Indian gaming legislation that many will agree needs to be updated. In 1988 most Indian gaming consisted of high stakes bingo and similar types of games. Since then, it has grown to become a billion dollar activity and has provided many tribes and surrounding communities with much-needed capital and employment opportunities. 
For those tribes lucky enough to be well situated geographically, gaming has proven successful. Where welfare rolls once bulged, tribes are employing thousands of people--both Indian as well as non-Indian. Once entirely reliant on federal transfer payments, many tribes are beginning to diversify their economies and provide jobs and hope to their members. 
For most tribes, however, gaming is not a viable development alternative. Indeed, only one-third of all federally-recognized tribes have any form of gaming and most of that is more like charitable bingo than Las Vegas or Atlantic City. On-line gaming, as well as competition from local and international operations, has created a very tight market. In Washington State, for example, as well as in other parts of the country, market saturation is leading some tribes to close their operations for good. 
Over the past ten years, the statute has only been significantly amended one time--in 1997 I introduced a measure to provide the federal National Indian Gaming Commission with the resources it needs to monitor and regulate certain Indian gaming operations. Today, a strengthened commission is beginning to fulfill its obligations under the statute and help maintain the integrity of Indian gaming nationwide. 
The lack of uniform standard operating procedures for Indian gaming continues to cause anxiety for many of those inside and outside of Indian country. Many Indian tribes, in cooperation with the states where gaming is located, have developed sophisticated gaming regulatory procedures and standards. Many tribes have put in place standards regarding the rules of play for their games, as well as financial and accounting standards governing those games. Not all tribal-state gaming compacts mandate such sophisticated regulatory frameworks. 
By setting threshold standards at the federal level, this bill will mean that Indian gaming customers throughout the nation can be assured that every Indian gaming establishment must comply with a federally established level of regulation, operation, and management, just as they are already assured that gaming proceeds may only be spent for certain purposes set out in the Act. 
When the Congress enacted the IGRA in 1988, states were invited, for the first time ever, to play a significant role in the regulation of activities that take place on Indian lands. The statute required tribes to seek to negotiate a gaming compact with a state before commencing any casino-style gaming. Though there were bumps along the way, this was a major concession by Indian tribes and one that worked reasonably well for 8 years, and which will continue to be available if it is chosen by both a state and a tribe. 
Under IGRA, before a tribe may commence casino-style gaming, it must seek to negotiate a gaming compact with the state where the gaming will occur. Up until 1996, if a federal court determined that the state was negotiating in bad faith or if the state decided simply not to negotiate, the tribe had the option of filing a lawsuit to bring about good faith negotiations. 
In 1996, the Supreme Court turned this process upside down when it handed down its decision in Seminole Tribe of Indians v. State of Florida. This decision said that a state may assert its Eleventh Amendment immunity from lawsuits to preclude tribes from suing it in order to conclude a gaming agreement. Also, some states have asserted that the IGRA may force them to regulate reservation-based gaming in violation of their 10th Amendment rights. My bill will allow tribes and states to continue to use the existing process to negotiate compacts if that is their desire. 
As I believe the Act should respect each state's sovereign right to absent itself from this process if it chooses to, we must also respect the Supreme Court's decision that Indian tribes have the sovereign right to offer gaming activities that do not violate the public policy of the state where those activities are offered. This approach is consistent with what the Congress intended in 1988. 
Finally, there are ongoing Congressional investigations of the so-called `Hudson Dog Track' matter involving whether the Interior Department denied an application by certain Indian tribes to acquire off-reservation lands for gaming purposes because of campaign contributions by a rival group of tribes. Even before these allegations surfaced, I expressed strong concerns about the acquisition of off-reservation lands for gaming purposes. 
The IGRA requires the Interior Secretary to consult with local officials, local communities, and nearby tribes in evaluating the tribe's application to take lands into trust. The Act also provides State governors with an absolute veto over such applications. In my opinion, federal laws and regulations already make it very difficult for the Secretary to take land into trust for a tribe if it is located away from a tribe's reservation or previous homeland. As a result, few tribes apply to have off-reservation lands taken into trust, and even fewer are successful. 
The IGRA imposes additional requirements on such acquisitions if there is any possibility that the lands will be used for gaming purposes. As a result of these requirements, I am aware of only two or three such acquisitions. Yet the opposition to Indian gaming that results from the mere possibility of such acquisitions is significant. This opposition far exceeds that speculative possibility that the Secretary, a local community, and a state's governor will all concur with such an acquisition. Thus, my bill will preclude off-reservation acquisitions unless the tribe and the state reach agreement to allow those lands to be used for gaming purposes. This provision will therefore encourage tribal-state cooperation rather than tribal-state conflict when it comes to gaming matters. 
My bill will also remove the argument that those Indian groups that are laboring to achieve federal recognition as tribes are doing so only to develop gaming. Achieving federal recognition is difficult enough, I do not believe it should be further complicated by squabbles over gaming. 
My bill will eliminate any appearance that federal officials and employees who are responsible for making decisions about Indian gaming are `cashing in' on their activities when they leave government service. By closing an existing loophole, my bill will establish that those federal employees who have made decisions concerning a tribe's gaming activities are bound by the same policies, procedures, and criminal laws that prevent other federal employees from profiting from decisions they made when working for the government. But it also preserves those provisions in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, which have dramatically reduced the number of federal employees by encouraging their employment by the tribes that contract to provide federal services under self-governance compacts and self-determination act contracts. 
I believe this bill addresses the most pressing concerns raised by states, local governments, and Indian tribes. Like all attempts at compromise, few parties will be completely satisfied. The legislation I am introducing will both please and disappoint the states as well as the tribes. Nonetheless, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, demonstrating a willingness to serve as an honest broker will, in my opinion, do more to foster genuine and lasting reform than simply becoming an advocate for one side or one point of view. Let there be no question of my commitment to ensure that Indian gaming be operated fairly and consistently with all relevant laws, and that the goals and objectives of the IGRA are fully achieved. 
As I have indicated, the Committee will address these and related issues in the coming weeks. By introducing this legislation, it is my hope that those with concerns with the regulation of Indian gaming work with me in the Committee to fully and fairly debate the issues before any actions are taken to amend the Act.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the `Reduction in Tobacco Use and Regulation of Tobacco Products in Indian Country Act of 1998'. 
After many hard months of negotiations between the states Attorneys General, class action plaintiffs, and the tobacco representatives, in June, 1997, a proposed settlement was agreed to. 
The proposed agreement tries to accomplish a number of goals: avoiding costly and lengthy lawsuits that will enrich the trial lawyers; creating a multi-billion pot of money to be used by the states and the tribes for tobacco-related health problems; and implementing a comprehensive set of advertising limits that the companies would agree to voluntarily. 
In reviewing the proposed settlement agreement, the objective of the Committee on Indian Affairs was to review the matters under its jurisdiction and make recommendations on how to implement that agreement on Indian lands. 
After two Committee hearings I am confident that as to the Indian issues, we have crafted a bill that addresses the concerns of both the tribes and the parties that seek enactment of the proposed agreement. 
In its hearings the Committee heard testimony on the use of tobacco products by Native Americans and how the proposed tobacco settlement would impact tobacco-related activities on Indian lands. 
Even though smoking is on the decline in other segments of American society, available statistics show that smoking and use of smokeless tobacco in Native American communities is at crisis levels. The percentage of Native American kids who use tobacco is breathtaking--in some parts of the country 80% of Indian high school students use tobacco products. 
Further, the health problems Native Americans face such as alcoholism and diabetes are compounded by the use of tobacco products. Vigorous efforts need to be made at the federal and tribal levels to prohibit access to tobacco and reduce youth smoking in Native communities. 
After hearing the concerns and recommendations regarding the proposed settlement by Indian tribal leaders, state Attorneys General, federal health and legal experts, and Indian legal scholars, a bill was crafted which addresses the major issues involved in tobacco regulation on Indian lands. 
The legislation I am introducing today includes legal protections for traditional and ceremonial uses of tobacco by tribal members; respects tribal sovereignty and authority to make and enforce laws on Indian lands; includes a commitment to provide the necessary licensing and enforcement funding to tribal governments that is consistent with allocations the states will receive; and a commitment to ensure sufficient funding to treat tobacco-related illnesses and reduce the epidemic of tobacco abuse in Indian country. 
I am hopeful that if a comprehensive agreement is enacted, the principles and provisions contained in this bill are included to make the agreement applicable to tobacco-related activities on Indian lands, to protect the traditional use of tobacco by Native Americans, and preserve tribal authority to make and enforce laws to govern themselves.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today not only as a concerned citizen but also as a concerned lawmaker. As the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee which oversees the White House budget, I have some serious concerns about the taxpayer funds being used to pay for the President's personal legal defense. 
In addition, I have to also state that I am concerned about the lack of response to committee requests. Specifically, on March 3, a request was made to the White House from this committee to provide responses to two simple questions: First, has the size of the legal staff within the Executive Office of the President, funded by appropriated money, changed significantly between fiscal year 1997 and fiscal year 1998? And, second, what is the current specific number of lawyers detailed to the Executive Office, and has that number changed significantly during this time? 
In a recent report, Mr. President, it appears that the cadre of attorneys at the White House has ballooned from 4 to 39 in just the last year and a half or 2 years. Fully one-tenth, according to that newspaper article, one-tenth of the White House budget now goes to pay those attorneys. A number of them were transferred from other agencies. And in this year's budget request from those agencies, they are asking for a full FTE for those attorneys. 
It appeared at the time that this information was both readily available and easy to provide, yet the White House has not given us any specifics. As of about a half an hour ago, we did get some partial answers but not nearly clear enough. 
During this same time, I continued to get Members and constituents asking me, as the chairman of the Treasury Subcommittee which appropriated the White House's budget, to provide them with some answers. 
Finally, on this past Friday, March 13, I wrote a letter in an attempt to get a response from the White House. In that letter I requested that I receive the information by them by 12 o'clock yesterday, March 18. In that letter, I also asked the White House to provide me with a list of the total number of attorneys detailed to all of the Executive Office and from which agency they came. Yesterday, the subcommittee received a call from the General Counsel's Office stating that we would receive that information by 9 o'clock this morning. And as I have mentioned, we did receive a partial answer. 
So now it is March 19, Mr. President, exactly 16 days after the initial request for information was made, and we still do not have the full answer. We are now preparing to do a hearing, as many of my colleagues know, Mr. President. I believe the American taxpayers have the right to ask some specific questions. 
The 12 attorneys that were so-called `borrowed' from the other agencies to help the President with his personal legal problems command very good salaries for which we expect them to do work in keeping with the mission of their agency and for what they were hired to do. 
What I would like to ask the Executive Office is, was the work of those attorneys in their agencies important? If it was important, then who is doing their work while they are temporarily borrowed or reassigned to the Executive Office? And if it was not important enough to keep them at their job, why did we hire them in the first place in the agencies? 
What concerns me here is that as an appropriator I have the responsibility to follow up on these matters, and I take that very seriously. I do not think we are asking anything unreasonable and certainly do not want to just pile on the President. But this is taxpayer money and we have a right to make sure it is being spent wisely. We need to verify that the White House is not using appropriated funds for the President's personal legal defense. It is already illegal for any Government entity to use appropriated funds for anything other than what Congress appropriated the money. 
In addition, there are many Government regulations from the Office of Government Ethics and the Justice Department which support the position that Government attorneys are to provide their services for Government interests only and not personal ones. That seems pretty clear and pretty well cut and dry to me. I do not request the answers to the questions that I believe are unnecessary. And I do not make frivolous requests. These are very important questions, plain and simple. 
Finally, Mr. President, I announce that our committee intends to hold a hearing on the Executive Office's fiscal year 1999 request before the Easter recess and fully expect their response to this inquiry prior to that hearing.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to amend the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my colleague Senator Allard. 
This bill represents our Nation's last opportunity to live up to an agreement we made with the two Indian Tribes in the State of Colorado. 
In 1976, the United States filed a claim asserting the historic rights of these Tribes to much of the water in the rivers in Southwestern Colorado. Rather than continue this disruptive and divisive litigation, the two Ute Tribes were parties to a Settlement Agreement in 1986, which was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President Reagan in 1988. 
So far, we have failed to construct any of the facilities promised in this agreement; even though Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton have consistently supported full funding for this Project. 
I was reluctant to introduce this measure because I still believe that this country, this Congress, and especially the United States Senate can be trusted to fulfill the solemn commitment that was made to these Tribes in 1988, when I was a member of the House of Representatives. Of course the United States Senate has consistently and without exception, voted to abide by every term of this agreement. 
But the Ute Tribes point to the 472 treaties broken by the United States. Rather than allowing their 1988 Settlement to become the 473rd, they are willing to modify the terms of this agreement 
to move it forward. The original agreement called for construction to start in 1990. Here it is 8 years later and we have not even started. 
These tribes have provided the United States with their last chance to honorably live up to the promises we have made to them. 
If the United States fails to provide these tribes with a water supply through the Animas-La Plata Project, the tribes will have no choice but to go back to court. Millions of dollars will then have to be spent in needless, expensive, and divisive litigation. 
One of our distinguished former colleagues, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, was fond of saying that in Arizona it is so dry that the trees chase the dogs. Mark Twain said that the West is so dry that we can't afford to drink water, we are too busy fighting over it. What he said was, `Whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting.' 
Throughout the history of this region, the need for water has dominated and dictated our development. About 85% of the water used in the West is stored in mountain reservoirs during spring run-off so it can be used during the hot summers. For thousands of years this has been a fact of life for those who live in the arid West. We are following the example of the Anasazi Indians who also knew the need to collect and store water for dry spells 2,000 years ago in the same area proposed for the Animas-La Plata. 
In fact, when the Animas-La Plata Project was authorized in 1968, a number of other projects were authorized along with it, including the Central Arizona Project in the Lower Colorado Basin and projects in the Upper Basin. These facilities have already been constructed. We constructed these projects to meet the pressing needs of people and development. Only the Animas-La Plata languishes. 
The 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act was a fair and honest agreement with the two Indian tribes in my state. Furthermore, it was a compromise. The parties participating in these Settlement discussions and negotiations included a number of water conservancy districts, the states of Colorado and New Mexico, and numerous federal agencies. Congress and the President made this Agreement the law of the land. 
The two Tribes have every legal and moral right to hold the United States to the terms of the 1988 Agreement we enacted. Like any party to a binding agreement, they have the right to continue to demand that the United States live up to its commitment to build the entire Animas-La Plata Project. But the Tribes have made what one of the largest newspapers in my state refers to as a `generous offer.' This bill is that offer. If Congress passes these amendments, we will be paying for our obligations under the 1988 agreement with a few cents on the dollar. It was once estimated that it would cost almost $700 million to fulfill our obligations to these two tribes. Now we can do it for $257 million. These two tribes have provided us with the opportunity to fulfill our legal obligations to them under the 1988 Act at a bargain basement price. 
Under the terms of the bill I introduce today, the legal claims raised by the Ute Mountain Ute and the Southern Ute tribes will be resolved once the Interior Department constructs the following facilities: 
A pumping plant to divert no more than 57,100 acre-fee of water per year from the Animas River; a facility to convey this water to an off-river reservoir; and a reservoir to hold this water until it is needed for municipal, industrial, instream flow or other authorized and approved uses. 
Mr. President, the quantity of water that will be diverted and used by this project was not set by the project's beneficiaries, it was not set by the Bureau of Reclamation, it was not set by me; rather, it was set by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. I quote the Service's recent Biological Opinion:  
An initial depletion not to exceed 57,100 acre feet for the Project is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Colorado squafish or razorback sucker nor adversely modify or destroy their critical habitat. 
The Service then goes on to agree that this level of depletion is consistent with the construction of the facilities that I have just mentioned. 
In addition: Two-thirds of water made available from these project components will be available to the two Ute tribes, with most of the balance available for municipal and industrial water, small irrigators in Colorado and New Mexico, and the Navajo Nation. 
The facilities to be constructed have been on the drawing board for decades. I think I can safely say that no project components in the history 
of developing water projects have gone through more environmental changes and more environmental regulations than this. In fact, here on the desk, I brought just the final supplement that was done after 1986, and it stands about half a foot high. If we stacked all of the different regulations that we have compiled end on end, we would have a stack over 3 feet high. I did not even bother bringing all of it to the Floor. But we have done virtually everything required to get this project developed. 
This represents only a portion of the environmental studies of this project conducted by just one of the Federal agencies involved. 
Those who have opposed this project in the past have had their own agendas: None of these agendas was concerned with this Nation's obligations to these two Indian tribes. 
Some complained about the price of the project while they conspired to inflate the cost by insisting upon wasteful study after study of this project. 
I think the tribes feel that they know there are certain interests who oppose the project and that they are the same interest groups that have opposed every project. They know that by driving the price up too much, it makes it much more difficult to build. But I think the United States' claim on being a trustee for tribes can only be fulfilled when we realize that our obligations under this original Water Rights Settlement Act must be complied with. 
The State of Colorado has done its part. It has expended $35 million to construct the pipeline needed to supply domestic water. 
The tribes have received their development funded of $57 million and derailed their water rights lawsuit in anticipation of the United States fulfilling its obligations. 
This Settlement proposal is the absolute minimum that we can ask these tribes to accept. More important, the most expensive part of this Project is the delay in constructing it. When I first became involved with the A-LP, about 15 years ago, the entire project could be built for around $315 million. 
When I think of the promises that were made to the Ute Tribes in my State, I am reminded of the words of Chief Joseph, the great Indian leader of the Nez Perce Tribe. When Chief Joseph came here to Washington he had this to say about the promises and assurances he received: 
I have heard talk and talk, but nothing is done. Good words do not last long unless they amount to something. Good words will not give my people good health and stop them from dying. Good words will not give my people a home where they can take care of themselves. I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. It makes my heart sick when I remember all of the good words and broken promises. 
As this bill is presently drafted, it enjoys widespread support among the people of Colorado, especially the people, local governments, and Indian tribes in Southwestern Colorado. 
State government, and literally all of our major newspapers. It is a significant attempt to compromise and make concessions by all parties involved. I believe we have come a long way. 
This bill is the product of significant attempts at compromise and concessions by all of the parties involved. I am pleased that the bill begins its legislative journey this far along. I know that not all of the parties who are affected by this bill agree with every one of its terms. While I can not respond to all of the concerns that have been raised, I can assure everyone that we will continue to work to address any legitimate concern raised about this legislation through the committee process. 
I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important legislation and meet the solemn commitments made to the Ute tribes in 1988.

Mr. President, I want to clarify the intent and effect of our amendment. It will not prohibit NHTSA from lobbying on behalf of tougher drunk driving laws, seat belt laws, or air bag requirements. In each of those cases, there are federal mandates or incentive programs designed and in place. It would also not prohibit NHTSA from lobbying on behalf of improved motorcycle safety. In fact, we would hope that NHTSA would engage in more activities designed to improve motorcycle safety and education programs.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, today I introduce legislation that is very, very special to me, and which in my opinion is a long time in coming to this Nation, to the State of Colorado, and particularly to my own ancestors. This bill is entitled the Sand Creek Massacre Site Historic Preservation Act of 1998. This legislation would authorize the Federal acquisition of property located within Kiowa County, CO, designated as a point of interest on virtually every map in this Nation and infamously known as the site of the `Sand Creek Massacre.' 
Today, this property is owned by a private individual, who has strong interest in selling the land. The bill I introduce today would authorize the National Park Service to acquire this land for fair market value in compliance with the agency's standard rules and regulations. My bill would permit full public access to this hallowed site to the public, and more importantly to the descendants of those who lost their lives at Sand Creek. 
To provide some perspective, I would like to briefly explain the historical facts surrounding one of the most disgraceful events in American history--the Sand Creek Massacre. 
During the early morning hours on the shameful day of November 29, 1864, a Colonel in the Colorado Militia, religious zealot, by the name of John Chivington, led a regiment of Colorado Volunteers to the Cheyenne's Sand Creek campsite, where a band of Cheyenne led by Black Kettle, a well-known `peace' chief, was encamped and unsuspecting of his fate forthcoming on this date. Federal army officers had promised Black Kettle safe passage if he would stay at his campsite and fly the American flag along with a white flag of truce over his lodge, but Colonel Chivington disregarded that flag, and ordered an attack anyway on the unsuspecting village. After many hours of brutal and cowardly fighting, the Colorado volunteers lost only nine men in the fight but managed to murder over 200 Cheyenne, most of them innocent and unarmed women and children. Most men were out hunting and were not in camp. When the skirmish ended, the Colorado volunteers scalped and sexually mutilated many of the bodies of my people, proudly displaying their trophies to cheering crowds in the streets of Denver while desecrating the Cheyenne Heritage. 
One report said that Colonel Chivington admonished his soldiers to kill the babies in the camp because, according to him, `nits make lice.' 
Many of these facts are not disputed. Congress held an inquiry, in fact, after that fatal date and heard extensive testimony on the actions of Colonel Chivington, resulting in a discharge of both him and then territorial Governor Evans. But since Colonel Chivington's unit was not a regular Army unit but rather a Colorado militia which soon disbanded after the fateful day, not one of the people were ever brought to justice. 
Mr. President, this description of the events cannot begin to describe the horror that must have taken place on that day. But this bill authorizes our Government to preserve a significant piece of history that I believe is needed to remind us not just of the horrible deeds that took place in this country to many people in our history, but to the Native Americans, and to honor that memory. In fact, at Bent Fort, a national historic site just about 30 miles from the location of the massacre, National Park officials tell me that the single most asked question at the fort is, Where was the Sand Creek massacre located? 
I believe that with this property being considered for sale, a rare opportunity exists for us to save an important piece of American history. We should move forward and try, through whatever means we can, to acquire this very sacred site. This action will provide remembrance of the event, allow present and future generations of Americans to learn from our history, which includes much more glory than disgrace. 
In closing, I do not know of anybody of my own ancestry who did not have a relative at that terrible place. 
I urge my colleagues to support this very important preservation piece.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take the time today to announce my support for the upcoming vote to override the President's veto of the Military Construction Line-Item Veto bill. This bill would have restored the funding to several very important construction projects in twenty-four states, one of which is my own. 
I voted for the line-item veto law. This law has recently been adjudged unconstitutional. We could simply wait for the Supreme Court to strike this law down. But I want to be on record reaffirming my belief that the President should have the authority to strike certain portions of congressional appropriation bills. However, I also want to be on record affirming the error in the President's line item in this instance of a certain Colorado project, as well as many others which my colleagues will attest. 
In vetoing the restoration of funding to these projects, the President commented, `the projects in this bill would not substantially improve the quality of life of service members and their families, and most would not likely use funds for construction in FY 1998.' Mr. President, I can assure you that this assumption is certainly not the case for the appropriation for work on the Army railyard expansion at Fort Carson. It is not, as the President seems to imply, a `pork project.' In fact, the Army itself stated it needs this project. It is included in the Army's 5-year development plan. 
This project is necessary to expand Ft. Carson's rail capacity to meet the minimum requirements to deploy several assigned units and potentially very large number of reserve units. Let me repeat that: this project is necessary to enable Ft. Carson meet the minimum requirements of deployment. In other words, Ft. Carson currently does not meet the minimum deployment requirements. 
In addition, the project would add several basic infrastructure components, including rail spurs, an operations support building and a maintenance shop. If these improvements are not made, the railyard's ability to deploy units, as a member of the `contingency force pool,' will be severely limited. 
As you can see, the project's completion is necessary in the Army's opinion. I urge my colleagues to vote to override this veto.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that gives our National Park Service the authority to require fee-based permits for the use of the parks in the making of motion pictures, television programs, advertisements or other commercial purposes. 
Our national parks are among our nation's most valuable resources. My `National Park Service Image Fee Permit Act' would help us to protect them and ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy their beauty by making sure the parks are reimbursed for their commercial use. 
The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service already have a similar permit and fee system for commercial filming on public lands. Rocky Mountain National Park in my home state of Colorado has had twenty-five commercial filming operations take place between 1996-1997. According to park supervisors many individuals in the entertainment business are shocked at the fact that they are not currently charged for the use of our great national parks. 
It makes no sense that our national parks' lands, that have been deemed to be even more precious by their designation, should be used commercially for free. This is especially important now when taxpayers are facing increased fees to enter the national parks and more and more people are enjoying our natural wonders every year in record numbers. 
As the Vice-Chairman of the Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation Subcommittee of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I am concerned about the maintenance backlog that exists in most of our national parks. It is also no secret that the amount of federal tax dollars available for that maintenance has been dwindling for some time now. 
I offer this bill as a funding vehicle for our parks to reimburse them for the administrative costs they incur by allowing the images of our precious national parks to be used in commercial ventures. This bill will not provide all of the funds needed to address the maintenance backlog in our parks, nor do I intend it to, but it will defray the real costs associated with making our parks available for commercial enterprises such as the motion picture industry. 
We can all understand why Hollywood or book publishers want to use the spectacular beauty of our national parks as backdrops for their productions. My bill simply allows the National Park Service to recover the real costs of allowing such use and devoting those fees to the parks for their preservation. Common sense directs us to do this, and I believe this bill is fair for the commercial users of our parks and more importantly, for the American taxpayers. 
This bill is similar to legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by my friend and colleague from Colorado, Congressman Hefley. 
Mr. President, I have a letter from the National Parks and Conservation Association that has reviewed and endorsed this legislation. I look forward to working with the Association, other interested parties and, of course, the Committee, to deal with the maintenance backlog at our national parks.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I are introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998, a bill to establish a matching grant program to help State, Tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for the use by law enforcement officers. We are pleased to be joined in this effort by the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and Senators D'Amato, Faircloth, Hollings, Johnson, Kennedy, Reid, Torricelli and Dodd. This bill expands on legislation I introduced last month to help law enforcement. 
There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our streets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against violent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our communities. 
Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and deadly weapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of Justice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--or 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and local officers--do not have access to bulletproof vests. 
The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most important pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can have. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives of more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers who do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed by a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, bulletproof vests save lives. 
Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to purchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 would form a partnership with state and local law enforcement agencies in order to make sure that every police officer who needs a bulletproof gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $25 million per year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. The program would provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law enforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing bulletproof vests and body armor. To make sure that no police department is left out of the program, the matching requirement could be waived for those jurisdictions that cannot afford it. 
While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a career in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure that officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a vest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an officer can have and often means the difference between life and death.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues today to recognize an organization that has been very valuable not only to the hard working ranchers and farmers that I represent in Colorado, but to everyone in America whose livelihood depends upon the cattle industry. 
Founded in 1898, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association is the marketing and trade association for America's one million cattle farmers and ranchers. 
Small businesses, like cattle farms and ranches, are the heart of the American economy. The U.S. cattle industry is comprised of more than one million individual farms or ranches that provide our nation with a steady supply of safe, nutritious beef. Living on a small ranch in Ignacio, Colorado, I know the vast majority of U.S. cattlemen are family farmers and ranchers who are skilled stewards of their natural resources and trained caretakers of the animals under their care. Eighty percent of cattle businesses have been in the same family for more than 25 years and 10 percent for more than 100 years. 
Cattle ranchers form the largest part of the U.S. food and fiber industry, which, in turn, is the largest segment of the U.S. economy--nearly 17.5 percent of the gross national product. Doing business in all 50 states, cattlemen contribute to thousands of rural economies and, directly and indirectly, add $153 billion to the national economy. It is also important to recognize that the beef industry provides 1.6 million American jobs, and the U.S. annually produces nearly 25 percent of the world's beef supply with less than 10 percent of the world's cattle inventory. 
In Denver, where the industry is commemorating 100 years of the cattlemen's association history, we have a unique opportunity for people all across America to join in celebrating the labor of generations of America's cattlemen and women. 
Since this historic event is taking place in my home state of Colorado, I would like to take this time also to recognize the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, which is one of the nation's oldest cattlemen's associations, founded in 1867, even before Colorado became a state. I am proud to say that with hard working grass-roots organizations like the National Cattlemen's Association and the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, issues that directly affect the West and across this country can be addressed in Washington with great success. 
In 1996, I joined Senator Domenici on the Senate floor in support of the grazing reform bill in the 104th Congress. It was a moving sight to see so many cattlemen and women in the Senate gallery and the halls of Congress working with their senators to help ensure passage of this vital legislation. Currently, grazing legislation is pending in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on which I serve. With endorsements from strong grass-roots organizations like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association and the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, we will continue to fight to get this legislation enacted into law. 
Once again I commend the National Cattlemen's Beef Association for 100 years of dedicated service to America's ranchers and farmers.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I honor Mr. Steven Chotin, one of Colorado's leading citizens, for his many contributions and outstanding dedication to our great state. 
On the heels of his 50th birthday, I would like to take this opportunity to formally recognize my friend, a long-time motorcycling partner, for his philanthropic and civic activities of the past few decades. Steven has been a legend in a variety of charitable causes in Colorado, giving of his time and energy generously, as well as financially, to The Denver Center for the Performing Arts, The Colorado Symphony, The Allied Jewish Federation of Denver, National Jewish Hospital, Shalom Park and many other worthy endeavors. 
Mr. Chotin has served on the boards of numerous community and charitable organizations, including Fresh Start, a program committed to paving a way out for Denver's inner-city youth. Equally renowned are Steven's activities in civic and business affairs. As head of The Chotin Group Corporation, National Mortgage Corporation and Merchants Mortgage Corporation, he has succeeded in providing gainful employment to a significant number of Denver area residents. 
I am sure I speak for all Coloradans in extending Steven my congratulations and appreciation for leaving such an indelible mark on our state by the young age of 50. I wish him many more years of happiness and fruition as a Colorado resident. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States will outline some important issues for our consideration during the second half of this Congress, and, as I have sat here for the last 40 minutes listening to some of my colleagues, they have spoken with great emphasis on the importance of the points on which they are going to agree and disagree with him. But today I rise, with my friend Senator Allard, to submit two resolutions that are on a happier note. These resolutions are to honor the outstanding achievement of the Denver Broncos in their winning of Super Bowl XXXII. 
The first resolution recognizes the entire Broncos organization and the other honors John Elway, the team's veteran leader, who happens to be a personal friend of both Senator Allard and myself. For the first time in 13 years, an AFC team has won the Super Bowl, and it is only the second time a wild-card team has won since 1980. Indeed, they were the underdog in the betting from Las Vegas to Atlantic City and all points in between. 
As those football fans among us might know, the Broncos have glimpsed victory on four prior occasions, but had victory elude them each time. All of that changed this past Sunday. With an inspiring team effort, they beat the odds and the legendary Green Bay Packers, a team as talented and formidable as any of the championship Packer teams before it. 
So sure were some people that the Broncos would lose, one electric appliance merchant in Farmington, NM, and Durango, CO, offered unlimited free appliances to customers on the day before the game if the Broncos won. Under the agreement, the customers would have only had to pay if the Broncos lost. Lucky for him, he had the foresight to take out a $300,000 insurance policy, which barely covered his losses to jubilant customers as the unexpected happened and they showed up yesterday at both of his stores to collect on their free appliances. 
In a brilliant athletic and strategic contest, both the Denver Broncos and the Green Bay Packers reflected qualities that we all value and admire: hard work, teamwork, preparation, dedication, and sportsmanship above all things. For that, and a beautiful display of terrific physical talent, both teams must be commended and applauded. 
I want to highlight the Denver team, of course, because I am from Colorado and because they displayed a resilience and perseverance in overcoming four previous Super Bowl losses, qualities which any one of us must cheer who, in any type of endeavor, has ever tried and failed. 
The Denver team succeeded with the leadership of John Elway, the MVP performance of Terrell Davis, a skilled offensive line that proved confidence and heart can compete with size, and a defense that proved as strong as it was fearless against a formidable offense. 
Our second resolution specifically honors John Elway for his outstanding accomplishment in leading the Broncos to its fourth Super Bowl appearance and its first Super Bowl victory. In bringing his team a national championship, Mr. Elway has given us lessons in the game of football for years to come, and Sunday he gave us a new lesson in perseverance, dedication and true sportsmanship. He is certainly a hero.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to prohibit the cloning of humans. This act would further extend last year's efforts by last year's law which banned federal funding of human cloning. Under my bill, there would be an outright ban on human cloning, whether publicly or privately funded. 
The scientific term for human cloning is `human somatic cell nuclear transfer.' That is what my bill would ban. My bill would not undermine or stifle scientific research in the area of genetics that promises to combat and cure disease in humans. This research includes the cloning of animals and human cells other than embryo cells. 
I am not a scientist and do not wish to insert myself in the process of scientific research and advances, from which we all benefit. However, when science crosses over the boundary of what is ethically and morally appropriate research, I have an obligation to respond on behalf of myself and my constituents. Congress--and its law-making authority--is the only mechanism available to address the issue of human cloning and assert the will of the American people that it not go forward. 
We have a responsibility to protect the moral and ethical foundation upon which this country was built. In recognizing that responsibility, both the Senate and House committees with jurisdiction have carefully looked at the implications of moving forward with legislation to ban human cloning. They have tapped the experts in the science of genetics and have confirmed what we as laymen believe--the cloning of humans is morally unacceptable and scientifically dangerous. 
During a March 12, 1997, House Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Technology hearing, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission testified that there is sufficient cause to warrant legislation because a developing child would be subject to undue harm as a result of current unscientifically plausible technology. In summarizing the Commission's report before the Subcommittee, its Chairman, Dr. Harold T. Shapiro, noted that this deficiency in the technology was coupled with far-reaching concern that human cloning is not deemed morally acceptable by society as a whole. 
A final hearing was held July 22, 1997, during which Dr. Hessell Bouma, a professor of biology, said it best. The transcript states that `he stressed the uniqueness, freedom, and respect intrinsic to human life. Cloning, Dr. Bouma testified, is in direct violation of all three, and therefore should be prohibited by law.' 
Mr. President, I don't think any of us can argue with that. 
I would like to urge my colleagues to take swift action and impose a ban on human cloning. We are all aware of the activities in Chicago to move forward with a human cloning experiment, so time is of the essence. I would ask that we work together over the coming weeks to pass a bill to prevent this and future efforts to wrongly clone humans.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, by way of legislation, I offer my support to the city of La Junta, Colorado, for its innovative and impressive response to the challenges facing the Lower Arkansas Valley. City officials have seized a unique opportunity to alleviate La Junta's housing crisis, expand the local Head Start program and increase access to child care, and solve Otero Junior College's dormitory problems. 
The city of La Junta, in conjunction with Otero Junior College, has proposed to take over the recently closed La Junta Air Base family housing site. Until one year ago, when it was farmed out to a civilian defense contractor, the Air Force's test range for its bomber pilots was housed in La Junta. Since then, several federal agencies have expressed interest in the site, but none has asserted their formal desire to reuse the facility. 
Further, taxpayers are spending nearly $100,000 annually to maintain an empty facility, while the city and residents of La Junta are losing out on a significant supplement to the local tax base. The reuse plan I am endorsing provides for a self-sustaining and revenue generating housing and local services site, which is a well developed and cooperative solution to some very real local concerns. 
Given the lack of any formal initiative on the part of a federal agency, which would be given priority consideration, I support the efforts of the city. Our college, Congressman Bob Schaffer, representing Colorado's 4th congressional district, has introduced legislation in the House of Representatives to convey the unused Air Force housing facility to the city of La Junta. Today, I am introducing a companion measure in the Senate. 
It is my hope that this bill will be referred to the appropriate committee and receive expedited consideration through next year's authorizing and appropriations process.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I intend to vote in favor of the Defense Department authorization conference report which contains critical funding for our Armed Forces. This legislation authorizes $268.2 billion in budget authority, the spending level recommended in the concurrent resolution on the budget. 
I also am pleased that the Senate and House conferees agreed to include provisions from two bills I introduced earlier this year. Section 1082 of the DOD conference report authorizes the flying of the POW/MIA flag over military installations, memorials and post offices around the nation and at other appropriate places of significance on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, and National POW/MIA Recognition Day. This provision reflects in large part the language of S.528 which I introduced on April 9, 1997. 
The United States has fought in many wars, and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by the enemy or listed missing in action. In 20th century wars alone, more than 147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners of war; of that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to this number those who are still missing in action, we realize that more can be done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country. 
The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but for their families who personally carry with them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they remember the loyalty and devotion of those who served. This section provides that support. 
The DOD conference report also contains important provisions to strengthen how the Defense Department tracks and accounts for our missing in action. 
To address this issue, the DOD Conference Report includes the following provisions. These provisions are based on S. 755, which I introduced on May 15, 1997. 
Civilian contract employees who accompany armed forces in the field are now covered under all DOD POW/MIA search and recovery policies. 
The theater component commander is now involved in the initial assessment of a missing person's status, where as before, the initial handling of the situation originated with the Secretary of Defense in Washington, DC. 
A new file must be opened and reviewed if any new information surfaces concerning the status, living or dead, of an MIA. 
A status review board, when making a determination of death must now provide a description of the location of the body, if recovered, and if the body is not identifiable, a certification by a forensic pathologist. DOD may also have input by other specialists of appropriate medical sciences. 
Personnel files will now be established for Korean conflict cases upon receipt of new information. 
Families of MIAs will now have more open communication with counsel appointed to investigate the missing person. 
Last summer, a United States forensics team returned what are believed to be the remains of four American Korean war soldiers who have been missing for nearly half a century. The following day, news reports then indicated that recently declassified Air Force documents show that the Department of Defense had knowledge of POW's in Korea after the Korean war. These events clearly reinforce the necessity for these provisions as thousands of POW and MIA's still remain unaccounted for. I believe that the provisions adopted by the Senate-House conference and included in the legislation we consider today will go a long way to help the families of our servicemen and women missing in action and will strengthen Defense Department policies for the future.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today, along with many of my colleagues, a Senate resolution that designates the month of November 1997, as `American Indian Heritage Month.' I feel it is appropriate and deserving to honor American Indians and Alaska Natives, as the original inhabitants of the land that now constitutes the United States, with this November designation as Congress has done for the past 7 years. 
American Indians and Alaska Natives have left an indelible imprint on many aspects of our everyday life that we often take for granted. The arts, education, science, medicine, industry, and government are areas that have been influenced by American Indian and Alaska Native people. Many of the healing remedies that we use today were obtained from practices already in use by Indian people. 
Mr. President, many of the basic principles of democracy in our Constitution can be traced to ideologies already in use by Indian tribal governments including such doctrines of freedom of speech and separation of powers. Our Founding Fathers benefited greatly from assistance given to them by Indian tribes in the early stages of establishing our Nation. 
Our respect for the preservation of natural resources, reverence for our elders, and adherence to tradition, were developed, in part, through contact with American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
American Indian and Alaska Native people have proudly served and dedicated their lives in the military defense of our country in wartime and in peace. In fact, their participation rate in the Armed Forces far outstrips the rates of all other groups in this Nation. They gave their lives in defense of this Nation even before they were allowed to be citizens in 1924. 
Many of the words in our language have been borrowed from native languages, including many of the names of the rivers, cities, and States across our Nation. Indian arts and crafts have also made a distinct impression on our heritage. 
It is my hope that by designating the month of November 1997, as `American Indian Heritage Month,' it will encourage self-esteem, pride, and self awareness in American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages. Many schools, organizations, Federal, State, and local governments also plan activities and programs to celebrate the achievements of American Indians and Alaska Natives. 
November is a special time in the history of the United States; we celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday by remembering the American Indians and English settlers as they enjoyed the bounty of their harvest and the promise of new kinships. That is why, this is an appropriate time of the year for this designation. 
Therefore, I ask for the support of my colleagues for this special tribute of this country, and urge the Senate to pass this resolution.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as we debate whether to proceed to the consideration of S. 1269, and on the larger question whether to provide the administration with fast-track authority, we have heard a number of arguments for and against this issue. As the debate continues, I suppose we will hear some things repeated over and over from different colleagues. I don't know a Senator, though--I think I can honestly say I don't know a Senator in this body who does not want to do what is best for American workers, American families, American farmers, American consumers, and the Nation at large. 
I think most of us, certainly me, certainly Senator Dorgan, believe that we are protrade. We believe that international trade is important. We know that we would like to see a time when there are very few barriers, very few tariffs, very few quotas--if any. I know, as many of my colleagues do, that if we had no barriers whatsoever, American manufacturers, farmers, producers could compete with anyone and in fact win in that competition on a level playing field. It seems ironic to me that we will go through this effort on legislation that, if it ultimately does pass both the House and Senate, will limit the deliberative and representative processes that are now at the heart of the legislative branch of Government. 
Essentially, fast track provides the administration with the assurance that any trade agreement it negotiates will come to Congress as a privileged piece of legislation. That means Congress must consider a trade agreement within 90 days of when the administration formally submits it to this body. In addition, there will be no hearings, no markups. The enacting bill will go to the floors of both the House and the Senate where debate is limited to 20 hours and no amendments are allowed. 
Mr. President, 20 hours of debate is not very long for an important issue such as international trade, when you consider there are 100 Senators whose States are heavily impacted by an extensive agreement, such as NAFTA was. It seems even more ludicrous to believe that the 20 hours of debate in the other body, the House, with 435 Members, would provide a fair hearing. That would come out to about 3 minutes per Member, as I understand it. Finally, after the debate is finished, the House and the Senate would only be able to vote `yes' or `no' on the entire agreement. For such an agreement, such as NAFTA, that translates into a vote on a document of about 1,000 pages long with no public input whatsoever. 
Fast-track authority is truly a unique procedure. If this authority is granted to the administration, Congress is essentially giving the President powers that I believe are supposed to be reserved for this body in our Constitution. First, it allows the President to control the agenda and determine when trade agreements are considered. More important, and second, it gives the President the authority to actually write the legislation upon which Congress will act. Added on top of this is the fact that I, as just one Member of the Senate, would not be allowed to offer any amendments on the final enacting bill, whether I liked it or disliked it. I am sure many of our colleagues have not yet decided how they will vote, and I certainly can count as well as anybody, and I think probably the tide might be going against us. But I for one do not believe we were elected to be rubber stamps for the administration, and on fast track that simply reduces this body to rubberstamp status. 
Article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States of America provides Congress with the authority to regulate commerce with foreign nations. The Constitution also gives the President the authority to negotiate with foreign countries. So let's not be misled when people say the President needs fast-track authority in order to negotiate. He can do that at any time. This is simply not true. Fast-track authority gives the President additional powers which our Founding Fathers had reserved solely for the Congress. 
I don't believe most of us are isolationists. I believe in free trade. In fact, in this day and age I think we all understand and agree that free trade is an important direction to go. But, quite frankly, I think many us do not support these pell-mell rushes to judgment. We get tired of the old argument that anyone who opposes fast track must be a protectionist and that the opponents of fast track are trying to hinder free trade. 
I have to tell you, if it got right down to who we are supposed to protect, whether it's the CEO's of multinational corporations or foreign-owned corporations or American corporations and American jobs, I would have to plead guilty that I prefer to protect our jobs and our corporations and our country. But these kinds of claims sound like something from a tabloid, designed to stir the emotions of the American public. 
I think, more important, when we talk about free trade we also have to link it to what is fair. We often hear that bandied around--fair trade. Like many of my colleagues, I am sorely disappointed in some of our past trade agreements that this country has entered into because I don't think they were, basically, fair to us. Before we continue to offer this extraordinary power to the administration, I think Congress has a responsibility to review past policies. Senator Dorgan has done a marvelous job. I think he has done it very well, pointing out the trade deficit, as an example. With every trade agreement we have made under fast track in the past, the trade deficit has actually gone up for America and not down. We got the worst end of every single agreement that was negotiated under fast track. 
For those who argue that if we fail to grant fast-track authority to the President, other countries will refuse to negotiate with the United States and the United States won't even be allowed to sit at the negotiating table, that is absolutely ludicrous. This is the largest economy in the world. There will always be a place at the table for any international agreements. 
Let's consider that fast track has been used only five times. Yet without it, the Clinton administration, as an example, has successfully negotiated 198 agreements. I think that speaks for itself whether fast track is needed. We are an economic powerhouse. The world knows that. It is in the best interests of other countries throughout the world to negotiate with us. That is evidenced by the 198 agreements that our trade representatives are so proud of that did not need fast track. So we really ought to do away with these scare tactics that are kind of designed to stampede us like sheep to voting for something in the last waning days of Congress without giving it a slow, deliberative understanding of what we are going to do and what we are going to put in place. 
Supporters say we need the agreements so we don't get 
bogged down in Congress and load it with amendments. I understand this is a slow process, and we are often accused of taking too much time. We often do add many things to the amendments. But I think most of those amendments are done in good faith. But if we are sent here to try to deal with good, fair trade agreements, I don't think there is a big problem. I don't think we should have to worry about it that much without fast track. The bottom line is we are here to represent this Nation and our own constituents from the States from which we were elected. 
I know my constituents did not vote for me to send me here to this great institution to give away their voice, to not let them be involved in it. I think most Senators feel the same way. We didn't get elected to represent Mexico or Chile or Japan or some other country. We got elected primarily to represent this Nation and our own States. 
I realize that this debate over granting fast-track authority to the administration is not to be a critique of NAFTA. But if fast track has been used only five times, then we have no choice but to bring up NAFTA if we are going to consider the merits of fast track. Just about 4 years ago, Congress passed NAFTA implementing legislation, and that was an over-1,000-page document. It was hailed as a major achievement that would create jobs and not cost jobs in America. I concede that NAFTA has benefited several segments of our society. There is no question about that. But I think, looking at it in toto, it has cost more than it has gained. 
Jobs is the perfect example. In October, 1993, I sent a letter with several other Senators to the U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, in which I asked about the potential loss of jobs and what the administration planned to do about displaced workers. 
In his response to me in November, 1993, Mr. Kantor replied that `NAFTA would account for no more than 400,000 jobs lost over 15 years.' I quote that directly from his letter. Perhaps those 400,000 jobs aren't important to some people--unless it's your job or unless it's the breadwinner of your household. Then it becomes very important. 
While I heard a whole number of figures on the number of jobs created by NAFTA used as evidence of NAFTA's success, many of those figures seem to discuss jobs that have been created basically as a result of increased U.S. growth that would have happened with or without NAFTA. Many of them dealt with the service industry jobs, too, but not hard, well-paying manufacturing jobs. I know that we need to increase our exports, and I think that we are trying to do that. We need to look at that in balance, about our imports, too. 
The Economic Policy Institute did just that. According to the Institute's recently released study, 394,835 jobs have been lost as a result of NAFTA. That was a net loss of jobs. I don't hardly consider that a success in our negotiating deals with foreign countries. I believe we simply cannot have a strong nation if we do not have a strong manufacturing base. Those jobs that left primarily were manufacturing jobs. If, Heaven forbid, we should get into some major international conflict, there is simply no way we are going to field strong military might from America if we have to import all of our parts for our apparatus from foreign countries. 
In effect, we might ask the question: Did it help workers anywhere? In my opinion it certainly didn't help the workers in Mexico under the NAFTA that we did pass. The maquiladora factories that sprang up overnight across the border are still paying poor wages, a dollar an hour or less in most jobs. Many of the workers live in substandard housing. Their children drink contaminated water. There is still a high incidence of sickness among those children. So it didn't help workers on our side of the border, and it didn't help workers on the other side of the border either. 
The problem is, we are coming close, now, to our targeted adjournment date, perhaps this Friday. And to meet that date, we may be forced to consider fast track within a more limited amount of time than we should to be dealing with this issue. 
But I think Senators will do the right thing. They will do what they can. Those of us who disagree with it, as he does, certainly commend Senator Dorgan for the leadership role he has taken. I believe it is time America stopped being referred to around the world as `Uncle Sucker' and return to that status that we had at one time being Uncle Sam, a nation of proud workers, manufacturing good-quality material for the rest of the world. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in supporting the Kyl-Archer `Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom To Contract Act.' 
When I first discovered that the version of this summer's Balanced Budget Act that was signed into law included such a drastic deviation from Congress' intent, which was to allow Medicare beneficiaries the choice to go outside the Medicare system for care, I was outraged. We agreed to ensure this freedom, not strangle it by kicking doctors out of the Medicare system for seeing Medicare patients on a private contract basis. By excluding physicians from Medicare for 2 years as a punishment for entering into a private contract, the law offers seniors a choice in one breath and takes it away in the next. 
If beneficiaries choose to pay for care out of their own pocket, that is their right. In no way does that constitute a criminal act. It is not an appropriate role for the Federal Government to be telling people how they can spend the money in their wallet--we already do enough of that with their tax dollars. 
The claims made for instituting such a restrictive law are unfounded. The assertion that seniors of significant means will be siphoned out of the system, creating an increased burden on the Medicare trust fund, makes several false assumptions. First, income and population statistics produced by the Social Security Administration indicate that nearly two-thirds of this country's over-65 population live at or near the poverty level, with less than 20 percent seniors earning more than $75,000 a year. Given that, it is doubtful that we'll see a wave of seniors rushing to contract privately and disrupting the Medicare system. Those same statistics also deflate the argument that droves of doctors will begin denying care unless patients agree to privately contract at a higher rate. The patients aren't there, leaving physicians strongly dependent--as they are now--on Medicare clients. Therefore, there is no threat of a two-tiered system of care, with only the wealthy having access to the best care. It is just not economically sound or feasible for a significant number of doctors to establish a `new tier' of medicine. 
The concerns about rampant fraud and abuse resulting from private contracting seem to disregard some very compelling facts. For example, over the last 2 years, Congress has implemented strict penalties for Medicare fraud and abuse, including thousands of dollars in fines and jail time. We have seen people go to jail for committing Medicare fraud. I have medical professionals contacting me regularly because they are so fearful of inadvertently misbilling Medicare and winding up in jail or out of business. More importantly, however, Medicare beneficiaries are copied on all bills that Medicare pays for services they've received. If a doctor double-bills Medicare for services that a beneficiary has already paid for out of their pocket, that senior would be dialing Medicare's 1-800 fraud number faster than you or I could blink. 
Finally, Senator Kyl's bill would allow patients to terminate contracts at virtually anytime, which will force physicians who are interested in private contracting to offer services at reasonable and competitive rates. Consumers would finally be playing a role in the Medicare market. 
Choice and competition have emerged as the most viable and fair solutions for saving the Medicare Program and ensuring quality, affordable healthcare for generations of Medicare beneficiaries to come. This bill embodies those very concepts. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, held an important hearing on the topic of NATO expansion. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified at this hearing. 
I feel that it is fitting at this time to keep in mind one of our recently retired colleagues who has played such a pivotal role in advancing the cause of NATO expansion. I am referring to my good friend from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown. 
Few people have played a more crucial or steadfast role for the cause of NATO expansion than Senator Brown. He started his efforts after Stalin's notorious Iron Curtain crumbled and never let up. His devotion and successes in advancing NATO expansion has made Hank Brown a warmly regarded household name throughout Central Europe, including the three countries that have been invited to join NATO in this first round of expansion, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
In fact, in the fall of 1996, the people of Poland showed their highest regards for Senator Brown by awarding him Honorary Polish citizenship in the name of the historic capital of Poland, Krakow. This is one of Poland's most prestigious honors. To this day, only two other Americans have received this honor, President Ronald Reagan and President George Bush. 
I recall a moving speech that Senator Mikulski--who sits on the Appropriations Committee with me--gave right here on the Senate Floor just after the Brown NATO Expansion Amendment passed last fall. Senator Mikulski said that her mother had just placed a picture of Hank Brown in a place of honor on her fireplace mantle at home. I hope it is still there. This is but one illustration of how the debate over NATO expansion transcends party lines. 
Senator Hank Brown has been one of the most effective advocates of securing freedom and peace for the people of Europe. We appreciated his valuable leadership in the Senate on the cause of NATO expansion. His legacy continues as the Senate proceeds with its consideration of this issue of great importance to the national security interests of the United States.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation which amends the Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-477). The current Act has proven successful and represents one of the few programs that works for Indian country. I want to thank Senator Murkowski for his work on his own `477' bill that takes aim at the specific problems experienced by Alaska natives in administering the 477 program. I am pleased to co-sponsor his and that he is co-sponsoring my legislation. 
It is my hope that together we can develop amendments that will clarify and strengthen the program for American Indians and Alaska natives and lead to better training programs and higher job placements. The main reason for the success of the 477 program is that it relies on the tribes themselves to make the key decisions involving the design and implementation of employment training and related matters. This program puts tribes, not federal bureaucrats, in the driver's seat. 
The Act empowers tribal governments to consolidate formula funds they receive for employment training and education services into one program--which in turn enables tribes to streamline services provided, while cutting administrative time and costs. The Act does contain certain limitations and in practice tribes have faced a few roadblocks. 
This bill removes these limitations, expands programs affected by the Act, and broadens permissible job creation activities. The unemployment problem in Indian country is well-documented. Tribes currently suffer from a national unemployment rate of approximately 52%, with some like the Oglala Sioux Tribe suffer from a rate of 95%. In comparison, the national unemployment rate is 6%. The lack of employment opportunities in Indian country has exacerbated an already-poor health situation, and has lead to grinding social problems such as crime, domestic abuse, and alcohol and drug abuse. While gaming has aided a few tribal economies over the past decade, the great majority of tribes continue to struggle with joblessness and poverty. Gaming is not the long term solution to the goal of tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency. Diverse job creation is. 
The Indian Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act provides tribes with a valuable tool in combating reservation unemployment. Indian tribes, like many American communities, are struggling to comply with the work requirements of the new welfare reform law. By focusing on job creation as a necessary component to any employment training program, tribes can add a new weapon in their battle against joblessness and poverty. 
One of the more consistent obstacles to greater success with the Act is the Bureau of Indian Affairs management of the program. To remedy this problem, the bill transfers lead agency responsibilities from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to the Office of Self-Governance (OSG), both agencies contained within the Department of the Interior. On May 13, 1997, the Committee on Indian Affairs conducted an oversight hearing to discuss the progress made by tribes under the Act. Tribe after tribe testified and revealed that this program is working, and working well. Tribes participating in the program testified that the program has reduced the federal paperwork burden associated with applying for related programs by as much as 96%, reduced administration time and costs of delivering job training services to tribal customers while enhancing the quality of services rendered. 
Most importantly, witnesses indicated great increases in job placements for tribal members. One of the reasons for the success of this program is that it is voluntary. It is not another imposition, by the federal government, of what we think will work for them. I would like to highlight the fact that this Demonstration Act has cost the federal government nothing--- the attraction of the program is in streamlining paperwork and other administrative burdens and operating primarily at the local level. The philosophy of the program is similar to that of the Self-Governance model under which tribes, under contract with the United States, manage services and programs formerly provided by the federal government. 
The witnesses at the May hearing discussed problems that they have had with the lead agency, the BIA. Of the four tribal participants testifying, all expressed dissatisfaction with the BIA. One testified that `the Bureau of Indian Affairs has been the biggest obstacle to the implementation of P.L. 102-477.' 20 tribal applicants representing more than 175 tribes currently participate in this demonstration, yet the BIA states that it has only two full-time employees committed to working on this program, and that number is in dispute. Additionally, all tribal witnesses reported significant delays in receiving programs funds consolidated under their approved plans. 
Reasons for the delays ranged from deliberate withholding to poor accounting procedures on the part of the BIA. The May hearing, as well as subsequent meetings held with the Tribal Working Group for the Demonstration Act, have made clear that there is a consensus among participating tribes that the OSG should undertake this program. The bill proposes to transfer authority to the OSG because that office has a proven track record in working with tribes to consolidate programs and services and to achieve more effective delivery to tribal members. 
If this Congress is serious about encouraging self-determination and self-sufficiency, we must provide tribes with the tools they need to further these goals. Reservation economic development and job creation go hand-in-hand and we cannot ignore this basic fact. 
The current Act has gone far in permitting tribes to do more with less, as the quality of training and education services has risen with increased job placements. These amendments take the next logical step, which is to encourage job creation and make the promise of the program a reality for those that want to work and want to be productive and want to improve their lives and the lives of their families.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1996 the Congress enacted historic legislation involving the financing, construction, and maintenance of housing for Indian people. With the enactment of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA), Indian housing is no longer solely in the province of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
With NAHASDA tribes have the opportunity to develop and implement housing plans that meet their needs and values, and can do so in a way that is more efficient. I am hopeful that the success achieved by tribes participating in the Indian Self-Determination and Education Act and the Self- Governance Act programs can be duplicated in the housing arena with the implementation of NAHASDA. 
The Act requires that funds for Indian housing be provided to Indian tribes in block grants with monitoring and oversight appropriately provided by HUD. By empowering the tribes themselves and decreasing tribal reliance on the federal bureaucracy, this Act is consistent with principles of tribal self-determination and self-sufficiency that have been the hallmark of federal Indian policy for nearly thirty years. 
By the terms of the Act, NAHASDA becomes effective October 1, 1997. This will mean sweeping changes in the way housing is built and financed in Indian country. It is my hope that we can build on the NAHASDA model and encourage related initiatives such as banking, business development, and infrastructure construction. 
Even though NAHASDA has yet to be implemented, both HUD and the tribes agree that there are sections in the Act that need clarification. The bill I am introducing, the `Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act Amendments of 1997', provides the required clarification and changes that will help tribes and HUD in achieving a smoother transition from the old housing regime to the new framework of NAHASDA. 
The proposed amendments contained in this bill are partly the result of a hearing held by the Committee on Indian Affairs in March, 1997, which focused on the management of Indian housing under the old HUD-dominated regime. 
Tribal leaders, Indian housing experts, and federal officials testified about funding problems and other matters, including the proper level of oversight and monitoring. The focus of the hearing was constructive and with an eye toward encouraging a better managed and more efficient Indian housing system. 
After auditing Indian housing programs from around the nation, and after reviewing HUD's monitoring and enforcement provisions, HUD's Inspector General testified as to perceived problems in the old housing regime and the NAHASDA framework. The IG's testimony included her opinion that clarifications were needed in the NAHASDA including minor changes to the Act's enforcement provisions. 
My goal as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs is to ensure that housing funds are used properly and within the bounds permitted by law. I also want to ensure that, consistent with federal obligations to Indian tribes, tribal members are properly housed and living in decent conditions. 
I am confident that with the implementation of NAHASDA, tribes will be able to better design and implement their own housing plans and in the process will be able to provide better housing to their members. In making the transition from dominating the housing realm to monitoring the activities of the tribes, HUD needs guidance from the Committee as to its proper role and responsibilities under the Act. 
The Act, and the amendments I am proposing today, will go a long way in making sure that the management problems that were associated with the old, HUD-dominated housing system will not be part of NAHASDA.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the Treasury and general Government appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. Included in the final conference report to that bill was language regarding the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment Program [TRAC]. 
TRAC is a voluntary agreement entered into by the Internal Revenue Service and restaurant employers across the country. Under TRAC, employers agree to better educate their employees on tip reporting and also to monitor the tips received by employees. Developed just a few short years ago, TRAC is seen as a way to combat the instances of underreporting and nonreporting of tips. 
However, it has come to the attention of many in Congress that the IRS may be using the threat of an audit to compel restaurant owners to enter into this agreement. While the IRS does have the authority to perform audits, I do not feel it is appropriate for this agency to be utilizing this right as a means of intimidation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, my colleague and I, Senator Kohl, are bringing before the Senate today the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill of the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Postal Service, and the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies. 
This bill contains $25.6 billion in mandatory and discretionary funding for fiscal year 1998. Reaching this level of funding has not been an easy task, and I would like at this time to publicly thank the ranking member, Senator Kohl, for his cooperation and continued effort in supporting this bill. We have tried our best to be supportive of the requests of individual Senators, and I think our bill reflects that. 
This bill funds 40 percent of all Federal law enforcement. Adequate funding for this activity has been a top priority for both Senator Kohl and myself. In addition to providing sufficient funding for law enforcement, this bill goes a long way in encouraging the IRS to stay on track with modernization while at the same time addressing their needs for the year 2000 computer program. 
Also, this bill provides for a new $195 million antidrug campaign for the Office of National Drug Control Policy targeted at our Nation's youth. This is $20 million above what the administration has requested. 
In addition, this bill provides $10 million for the Drug Free Communities Act, a program which 27 Members of the Senate cosponsored. These funds will be used for the establishment of local counterdrug efforts focusing on successful local initiatives. 
The bill also includes $159 million for the high intensity drug trafficking areas, or HIDTA's, as they are known. This provides funding for the existing HIDTA's, which are in Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, the southwest border, Washington/Baltimore, Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands, Atlanta, Chicago, Philadelphia/Camden, Cascade, the gulf coast, Lake County, the Midwest, the Rocky Mountains, San Francisco, and Detroit. In addition, funding is provided for the new HIDTA's in West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, central Florida and Wisconsin. 
The bill also provides $10 million for the ATF's Gang Resistance Education And Training Program, or GREAT, as it is known, which many of my colleagues also support. This program provides grants to local law enforcement agencies. 
There is also $13 million for an antidrug technology transfer program targeted at State and local law enforcement. This new program aims at getting much-needed counterdrug technology currently used by Federal law enforcement out to those in the State and local communities in their efforts to help them in their efforts in fighting the drug war. 
These are just a few of the items funded in this bill, Mr. President. This bill has taken lots of very, very hard work to stay within the budget agreement and still fund many important programs within the jurisdiction of the bill. I think this bill takes a strong stand for law enforcement while at the same time meeting the needs of many non-law enforcement agencies within the bill. 
Therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to support this bill. I believe it goes a long way in supporting what we all believe is important, primarily to continue to do what we can to reduce crime in the Nation. 
Mr. President, this bill is the result of lots of hard work on behalf of Members and staff, too. I wish to thank all of them for that effort. I believe it deserves our support. 
I now yield to Senator Kohl, our ranking minority member.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback, I commend Senator Wellstone for personally taking the lead on many of our children's issues in the U.S. Senate. I have always admired him for that. He knows my background from a home for orphans as a youngster, and I have always really appreciated his willingness to fight the battles for so many children in Congress who do not have a voice themselves. 
In this bill there are many dollars, in fact, many tens of thousands of dollars, that are going to eventually help youngsters. The GREAT Program is a good example, the Youth Crime Awareness Program is a good example. Just because we fund money through the Federal agencies doesn't mean that some of it has not gone to help reduce gang violence or trying to get youngsters away from a life of crime. 
I point out that I think in the other bills that have come before the Senate we have tried to at least keep the baseline steady, in fact, increased funding for many children programs in other areas of the national budget.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleagues from Kansas and Minnesota. 
I point out a couple of things: It has been 5 years in which most of the Members voted down a cost-of-living increase for themselves; also, as they both remember when we were here on the floor with this bill a month or so ago, it was Senator Brownback's amendment and cosponsored by Senator Wellstone and me to delete that COLA increase from the original bill. 
So I think I have a pretty strong record. In fact, I have never voted for a pay increase in the U.S. Senate. And in fact when we did go to conference, as the Senator probably knows, both Senators probably know, there was a vote. It was a tie vote. It was not deleted. But Senator Kohl and I both voted against a pay raise in conference, if you want to use that phrase, but some people have a disagreement. However, we lost. 
The question here is, should we sink a $26 billion bill because we didn't get our way in conference or we didn't get our way on the floor? I have been torn with this myself, too. It is a difficult decision for all of us, but frankly I just think there is so much good in this bill that there are other options. Certainly we can return it to the Treasury. If Members do not want it, certainly they can give it to charity as I have done in the past. They can give it to scholarships. 
From my perspective, Mr. President, this bill is extremely important. Today is the date that funding runs out. It seems to me we need to pass the bill even if we don't agree with the various parts of it.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will consider the Treasury-Postal appropriations conference report. Under the order, there will be 60 minutes of debate followed by a vote on the adoption of the conference report. Therefore, Senators can expect a rollcall vote at approximately 11 a.m. or earlier if debate time is yielded back. 
Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the D.C. appropriations bill. It is the intention of the majority leader to finish action on this measure today. 
As a reminder to all Members, in observance of Rosh Hashanah, no rollcall votes will occur this week after 1 p.m. today. All Senators' cooperation will be appreciated in allowing the Senate to conclude action on the D.C. appropriations bill and any available appropriations conference reports.

Mr. CAMPBELL. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will provide for a much needed clinical trial for the benefit of women's health. My bill would provide $20 million to the Nation's Office of Women's Health to conduct a large-scale clinical trial of digital mammography, involving 50,000 women and 20 sites, which could yield hard data in as little as a year regarding the potential of this technology. 
Digital mammography is our best bet for bringing the fight against breast cancer into the 21st century. This technology could answer the question of what age a woman should begin seeking annual mammograms. It could prevent unnecessary biopsies, as well as catch the countless breast masses undetected by conventional mammography. Dr. Martin Yaffe, a senior cancer-imaging researcher from Canada, is quoted in the Wall Street Journal of March 20, 1997, as drawing this comparison, `Using a conventional x ray mammography to find a tumor in dense breast tissue is like trying to find a cotton ball in a cloud. Digital technology allows us to improve the quality of the image and avoid missing the cancer.' 
While conventional mammography invokes the usual procedure for x rays, which views the film of a breast image on a light box, digital mammography takes advantage of an advanced x ray source for digital image capture, allowing image enhancement, feature recognition, and the ability to adjust the display contrast to highlight shadows and otherwise undetected signs of breast cancer. Mammography is the only means for detecting breast micro-calcifications, typically the earliest indicator of nonpalpable breast cancers. 
Many of my Senate colleagues have taken a personal and avid interest in combating breast cancer. With good reason. More than 40,000 women will lose their battle with breast cancer this year alone, while another 2.6 million will continue to live with the disease. Further, the rate of diagnosis has been steadily increasing for the last 50 years. For women aged 40 to 45, breast cancer is the leading cause of death. Given these staggering statistics and the fact that women are literally defenseless against this disease, it is imperative that we do everything possible to promote early detection and treatment. 
On June 3 of this year, 62 U.S. Senators sent a letter to the Appropriations Committee, urging funding for the Department of Defense Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. This program is world renowned and responsible for many of the most important advances in breast cancer research. It has even facilitated several small-scale trials in digital mammography. 
However, this program has, to date, proven unable to conduct a large-scale clinical trial of digital mammography. And yet, it is only a large-scale trial that can determine definitively the efficacy of this technology in saving women's lives. There are two bottom lines here. First, the trial would tell women at what age and with what frequency they should receive mammograms. Second, the trial would provide the Health Care Financing Administration with the data it needs to set a reasonable and appropriate cost for a digital mammography. We are all familiar with the role HCFA plays in setting not just rates of reimbursement but standards for reimbursement of healthcare services; the private sector takes its lead from HCFA. Once HCFA acts to make digital mammographies available to women, private pay insurers will follow suit. Therefore, in the interest of public health, the onus is on us to move these trials forward. 
The NIH has an appropriation from the Senate for next year that reflects almost a billion dollar boost. Rightly so. But despite that, the National Cancer Institute simply does not have the resources to fund a clinical trial of this size. Grant dollars are still scarce relative to the number of compelling grant applications. The reality that NCI is simply unable to dedicate the necessary resources to conduct a large-scale trial of digital mammography is unfortunate yet understandable. The Senate is aware of this dilemma, and shares the frustration of the Nation's breast cancer victims. In explaining its fiscal year 1998 allocation for the National Cancer Institute, the Appropriations Committee report for Labor, Health and Human Services and Education noted that `the national investment in cancer research remains the key to bringing down spiraling heath care costs, as treatment, cures, and prevention remain much cheaper than chronic and catastrophic diseases, like cancer.' 
As Congress is well aware, the financial cost of breast cancer is indeed staggering. We spend over $5 billion annually on healthcare for women fighting breast cancer, a figure that is matched in the cost of lost productivity to our overall economy. Further, the human cost of this disease is felt tenfold by the families and communities whose lives it touches. 
I realize this bill breaks with convention, to a certain degree. I am not assuming a level of scientific expertise that supplants that of the true experts at NIH. I am a firm believer in letting science drive where our research dollars are spent. However, I am willing to force the issue for the sake of women's health. We have available to us cutting edge technology that could yield us a remarkable return in the form of women's lives. My bill provides a modest sum to ensure that a large-scale clinical trial of digital mammography does not go unfunded any longer.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many of my colleagues and I have received complaints from constituent companies, or from constituents who are affiliated with companies, which are encountering unfair and illegal business practices in other countries. What is especially disturbing is that many of these countries are receiving significant amounts of U.S. foreign assistance. 
Ukraine, for example, is the fourth largest recipient of United States foreign aid, receiving approximately $228 million in 1997. Yet, despite this generous U.S. assistance, corrupt government officials cheat and threaten U.S. businesses and investors. 
In March of this year, the Motorola Corp. pulled out of a $500 million investment because of arbitrary decisions made by powerful bureaucrats. News reports indicated that Motorola's decision came less than 2 weeks after the consortium it was leading was selected as one of three winners in a tight competition to install cellular phone networks in that country. As reported, the government kept changing the rules up to the last minute which drove Motorola to its startling decision to pull out. The Wall Street Journal called Motorola's experience `a case study of the pitfalls faced by investors in Ukraine. 
The Foreign Operations Subcommittee of which I am a member held a hearing on May 6 regarding the Ukraine, Russia, and the New Independent States. The hearing considered the administration's request for millions of dollars in new funding for these countries. A number of subcommittee members and I raised with the witnesses specific examples of United States companies and American investors who are victims of corruption and dishonesty by the Ukrainian Government. 
I would like to take a minute and highlight some statements made by AID Assistant Administrator Thomas Dine at that hearing which underscore how serious the situation is in the Ukraine. Mr. Dine testified that `there are real problems in the Ukraine. The perceived level of official and unofficial corruption is pervasive and deep.' He also testified that `the Deputy Prime Minister, the country's leading reformer, recently resigned.' And, `major and small U.S. companies, faced with harassment, intimidation, and bribery are leaving the country.' Mr. Dine further testified that `we cannot expect American investors to do business in Ukraine or any of the NIS countries if they are not going to be treated fairly.' I fully agree with this last statement, and believe we in Congress should act to ensure American investors are treated fairly, especially in those countries which are receiving millions in American tax dollars. 
Corruption is a major problem for companies around the world. The World Bank recently surveyed international executives who identified corruption as the biggest problem they face in doing business in Latin America, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa. 
And, we have seen disturbing news reports of the extent of corruption and illegal practices which are adversely affecting U.S. businesses abroad. A New York Times article of May 24, 1997, cited a Commerce Department finding that U.S. companies lost approximately $11 billion in contracts since mid-1994 because of bribery by their foreign competitors of foreign officials. And, this staggering loss is attributed only to those high-profile cases which were identified. Another report cited in the June 2, 1997, 
Economist Intelligence Unit, cited a loss of $45 billion to American companies because of corruption. 
How many more millions of dollars have U.S. companies lost because of corrupt practices by foreign officials? 
Mr. President, corruption in foreign countries hurts the U.S. economy. Trade with foreign countries creates and supports American jobs. Trade helps keep prices low, provides a greater selection of goods, and creates a larger market in which American companies can sell their products. Corruption limits the possibilities for U.S. investment and exports. It increases the risk and costs of doing business to the detriment of U.S. businesses and consumers. 
Some important steps are being taken on the international scene. In May 1997, the 29 member nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], which is composed of the world's largest industrialized nations, reached an agreement to fight corruption. This agreement is the first international accord which makes it a crime to bribe foreign officials. 
And, on July 31, the International Monetary Fund decided to end its $216 million loan agreement with Kenya because of corruption and governmental mismanagement in that country. 
But, more needs to be done. 
The United States, in effect, is subsidizing other countries which are harassing U.S. companies and American investors abroad. This is unfair to U.S. businesses and unfair to U.S. taxpayers. And, this practice should stop. 
That is why I am introducing today the International Anti-Corruption Act of 1997. This legislation requires the State Department to submit a report and the President to certify by March 1 of each year that countries which are receiving U.S. foreign aid are, in fact, conducive to American businesses and investors. If a country is found to be hostile to American businesses, its aid from the United States would be cut off. 
The certification would be based on whether a country is making significant progress in, and is committed to, economic reform aimed at stemming corruption. The specific factors of economic reform which the State Department would consider include: market principles, private ownership, equitable treatment of foreign private investment, adoption of a legal and policy framework necessary for such reform, protection of intellectual property rights, and respect for contracts. The certification also would determine whether that country is making significant progress to eliminate corrupt trade practices and become integrated into the world economy. 
Based on the State Department's findings, the countries would be assigned to one of three categories regarding their business climate: Conducive for U.S. business; not conducive to U.S. business; or hostile to U.S. business. 
If the President certifies that a country is hostile to U.S. businesses and investors, the U.S. Government would immediately cut off foreign aid to that country. The United States also would vote against any loans to this country in the multilateral development banks. The aid would remain suspended until the President certifies the country is making significant progress in implementing the specified economic indicators and is no longer hostile to U.S. business. 
If the President certifies that a country's business climate is not conducive for U.S. businesses, that country will, in effect, be put on probation. The country would continue to receive U.S. foreign aid through the end of the fiscal year, but aid would be cut 
off on the first day of the next fiscal year unless the President certifies the country is making significant progress in implementing the specified economic indicators and is committed to being conducive to U.S. business. 
This probationary period is similar to the one in S. 457, which I introduced on March 19, 1997, regarding the drug certification process. This new approach would provide a specific time period during which the country on probationary certification would be expected to comply with certain conditions stipulated by the administration. If these conditions were not met at the end of this period, the United States would act firmly and cut off aid. 
I initially designed this alternative to put countries on notice that the United States had serious concerns about their lack of cooperation. But, I also wanted to provide a fair period of time during which those countries could address U.S. concerns. 
I included the probationary period in the bill I am introducing today for those countries which fall in the `not conducive for U.S. businesses' category, because I believe it is important to provide adequate notice to these countries which may have important ties to the United States. And, access to more timely and specific information during this probationary period would assist Congress in exercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities. 
The third category applies when the President certifies a country is conducive to U.S. businesses. Foreign aid continues without interruption. 
My bill includes the customary waiver authority where the national interests of the United States are at stake. For countries certified as hostile to or not conducive for U.S. business, aid can continue if the President determines it is in the national security interest of the United States. However, the determination expires after 6 months unless the President determines its continuation is important to our national security interest. 
The bill also contains a provision which would allow aid to continue to meet urgent humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, disaster and refugee relief; to support democratic political reform and rule of law activities; to create private sector and nongovernmental organizations that are independent of government control; or to develop a free market economic system. 
Finally, the bill directs the Commerce Department to establish a corruption hotline. Through this toll-free number, U.S. businesses and investors will be able to report unfair and illegal practices they are encountering in foreign countries. The Commerce Department would use that information in its investigations and would pass the information along to the State Department to be included in its annual report. 
At a time when we are working to balance the Federal budget and make tough spending choices here at home, we can no longer tolerate or afford to have our Government misdirect U.S. foreign assistance to corrupt countries, especially countries harassing American investors. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill I am introducing today to fight corruption, protect American investors and businesses abroad, and improve the allocation of U.S. foreign aid.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to support my friend and colleague from Arizona in his efforts to address the needs of law enforcement in Indian country. Tribal governments are in desperate need of these funds, which will help them to combat the cancer of gang activity growing throughout the country. 
I listened very carefully to my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan from New York, and I have to say that we are not trying to kill the Woodrow Wilson Center; we are just trying to prevent some young Americans from being killed. We are not trying to destroy it. We are trying to prevent a culture from being destroyed. I know, as all of my colleagues know, that we have to make some very tough choices if we are truly going to get our deficit under control and balance the budget. I don't know much about the Woodrow Wilson Center, but I suppose it is very important from a scholarly standpoint. The lives of people that are affected on Indian reservations with our youngsters going into gang activity, I think, is equally as important. I don't think we can put a price tag on their lives. 
The Senator talked about the memorial being a living memorial. I simply believe that Senator Kyl is on the right track when he wants to keep more youngsters on the Indian reservations also in that State--an alive State. They tell me that the scholars at the Wilson Center get about $43,000 a year to study different projects. I was looking at some of the projects. Very frankly, they may be very important, but some of them I don't quite understand. 
Let me read into the Record a few of the projects that have been done. Here is one: popular mystical sectarianism and models of rationality in prerevolutionary Russia; family and society in 
greater Syria; making China perfectly equal; creating language for westernization in early Meiji, Japan. I went to Meiji University in Japan and I don't remember that one. The rise and fall of childrearing experts in 20th century America. I would like to see somebody do a little more study on the rise and fall of children in America and where we have to go to prevent them from getting more involved in gangs. One that I almost can't pronounce is the malediction of malpractice medicine and misfortune in post-colonial Zimbabwe. 
That may be very important. I am not going to disagree with the Senator from New York. Maybe it is. I think that we have to recognize, though, that writing about starvation and starving are two different things. Doing studies about youngsters at risk who may be dying from gang violence and then talking to their families who have watched their youngsters die in gang violence are two different things. 
I wanted to reaffirm to the Senator from New York that we are not trying to destroy the Woodrow Wilson Center. I am sure it is very important. We just know that there are some things that we face that demand immediate attention, and we think this is one of the ways we can do it. 
As my colleague noted, over the past 5 years, homicide rates across America decreased by 22 percent. But on Indian reservations, it went up by 87 percent during the same 5 years. 
Yesterday, we had a joint hearing of the Indian Affairs and the Judiciary Committees. Testimony in that hearing revealed that gang violence poses a very special threat to America's Indian tribes that they are simply not equipped to deal with. Those tribes, we noted with interest through the testimony, that have a closer proximity to metropolitan areas, like Phoenix and Detroit, or any large metropolitan areas, that adds more and more pressure on inner-city gangs, like the Crips or Bloods, whatever, and they tend to migrate out and go to a path of least resistance--in this case, the Indian reservations. 
Studies conducted by Federal agencies, universities, and tribal governments reveal that gang activity within Indian country has steadily increased over the past decade. A study in 1997, as an example, of 132 tribes conducted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Law Enforcement Division estimated there were 375 active gangs with approximately 4,600 members. In Arizona alone, as Senator Kyl stated, a recent FBI study identified 177 gangs on 14 different reservations. 
Juvenile gang activities poses a unique threat to all jurisdictions. And, since there are multiple jurisdictions on Indian reservations, there are often people who should be prosecuted that simply fall through the cracks because of the time consumed in defining who is in charge, who has the jurisdiction for the person. In Indian country, the potential growth is even greater in this jurisdictional maze than it is from any downtown community that faces gang activities. 
These limitations on tribal courts and law enforcement authority are imposed by the Federal Government. We can't continue to tie the hands of the tribal justice systems, refuse to adequately fund their law enforcement, and then expect them to do an adequate job in protecting their citizens against gangs. 
The Office of Tribal Justice within the Department of the Interior recently stated that `* * * it is twice as likely that a reported crime will be violent'--on the reservation--`as compared with the rest of the United States, yet there are only half as many law enforcement officers on Indian lands per capita.' 
It is absolutely a problem that is just virtually out of control. 
The complexity and severity of youth violence and criminal gang activity within Indian country demands immediate attention. These funds will enable tribal governments to protect their citizens, and they will go far in fulfilling our obligation to protect and preserve the health and welfare of our Indian communities--and the people who are non-Indian who happen to live in those Indian communities. 
I know that the Woodrow Wilson Center is important. They get a great deal of private money from well-meaning and good-hearted Americans who contribute regularly to that center--unlike Indian reservations. You rarely have people who are going to donate money to the Indian people who are trying to reduce gang violence. They depend almost totally on Federal money to do this. 
With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl amendment, and I yield the floor. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the time, and my colleague from Kansas allowing me to speak to this a little bit today. 
Yesterday, we had a very extended debate here on the floor of the Senate, and several of us took the opportunity to address this Nation's shameful history in its dealings with American Indians. One of the areas that is the most shameful is the history of failing to abide by its treaties and agreements with native tribes. 
This country, as you know, Mr. President, coming from a State that has so many Indian tribes, has had very little respect for the lands and rights of aboriginal people, including the rights of the Wyandotte Tribe in question today. 
For example, in 1966 the Congress enacted a law requiring the Wyandotte cemetery be transferred and sold. That law is still on the books, fortunately. The tribe, however, opposed the action and the cemetery was not sold. In this respect, the tribe was seeking to preserve its burial site, culture, and history at a time when the United States was ignoring the tribe's rights. 
Frankly, Mr. President, being the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I find nothing more distasteful to me than to referee intertribal fights. Those disagreements often pit family against family, brother against brother, sister against sister. But I feel compelled to speak out in support of the Brownback amendment today. 
Let me try and ferret through this as I understand it. We have two tribes linked by culture, linked by history, linked genetically, probably linguistically, too. The Oklahoma Wyandottes have trust title, although this is being contested as I understand in Federal court and also being dealt with in the Department of the Interior. 
The focal point is a cemetery. The Indians that have control of the cemetery, i.e., they have kept it up and taken care of it, are the Kansas Wyandottes. This cemetery, as Senator Brownback has said, has been a burial place for predominantly Indians ever since 1855, 140 years. 
Now, the Oklahoma Wyandottes want to build a casino on this cemetery. That in itself is very interesting to me, Mr. President, because those of us who live on reservations, who come from Indian country, we have known literally since childhood the reverence, the feeling that Indians have about burial places. Most of the time, regardless of years, they don't call them cemeteries. They call them holy places or burial places. They consider them places that should be undisturbed, treated with reverence, and very seriously. I pity the construction company that would ever try to build a high rise or a roadway or something of that nature through an Indian burial ground because they do have laws on the books, we have laws on the books right now dealing with Indian burial places that prevent construction in those areas. 
Well, very simply, Mr. President, just because they are Indian, they can't have it both ways, and it would seem to me there are many questions that are left unanswered if we try to make a policy change on an appropriations bill. For instance, we have not, to my knowledge, heard from the State of Kansas. Under the 1988 IGRA any tribe that wants to build a casino or open a casino within a State has to reach some kind of understanding with the State, not to exceed the State law in non-Indian owned casinos. To my knowledge, they have not done this. We have not heard, to my knowledge, from anybody at Huron who would be affected. We have haven't heard from people in the local communities, the citizens who are going to be affected or the mayor of Kansas City. We simply do not know, if we do pass this into law, how it would affect the ongoing litigation. I simply think it is the wrong vehicle. 
Now, I am not familiar beyond that with the circumstances of this case, but I think that we could be doing ourselves a disservice by not having the supporters of this, that is, the opponents of the Brownback amendment, bring it forward as a legislative piece of paper where we can deal with it in legislative committees. I am not aware of any bill being introduced to that effect either. 
So I would go on record, Mr. President, as saying that my feeling from a historical and cultural standpoint is this should continue to be used what it was originally used for, and that's basically what the Brownback amendment does. But no Congress is bound by the action of a previous Congress. We all know that. So if at later date a future Congress, whether it is the 106th, the 108th or whatever, feels it should reverse that because of something we don't know and do it by legislative action, then that's the way it should be done. 
Now, they tell me that the Wyandottes of Oklahoma were only informed as late as last week of the Brownback amendment, but by the same token many supporters of the Brownback amendment didn't know of the original language in this bill until the last couple of days. So I think they are on a level playing field from that standpoint. 
With that, Mr. President, I simply say I hope my colleagues would support the Brownback amendment. I yield the floor. I thank you.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I have an amendment, but before I send it to the desk, I want to make a few remarks on H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior spending bill. I certainly want to commend the managers, Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd, for their efforts in constructing a spending bill that balances the competing interests of the approximately 27 different agencies and programs included under the jurisdiction of this committee. As the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I want to acknowledge both Senator Gorton's and Senator Byrd's efforts in funding Indian programs that are administered through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Service at the levels that meet or exceed the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request. 
Overall, the funding for these two agencies, which accounts for the great bulk of Federal spending on Indian-related programs, is significantly increased over fiscal year 1997 enacted levels to the tune of about $150 million. The committee has given priority to funding basic services that are provided to Indian communities through tribal priority allocation [TPA] of the BIA and through direct services provided by the Indian Health Service, while also funding several important construction initiatives, of which there is currently a tremendous backlog. 
While I have supported the priorities given to funding Indian programs, I have shared my concern with many colleagues over two provisions that remain in the bill. Senator Gorton has alluded to those two sections, section 118 relating to the means testing of TPA funding, and section 120 relating to the broad waiver of immunity imposed on tribal governments. Both are broad policy-related items that I felt should not be included in this spending measure. 
I am happy to announce that after several meetings--and Senator Gorton alluded to one we had yesterday afternoon--with concerned Members on these provisions, an acceptable accommodation has been made with regard to both of these provisions. At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment that will reflect this agreement. 
I want to speak briefly to each of these provisions and why, as presently written, they would adversely impact tribal government activity to a degree that is all but unknown. 
As I informed my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee prior to markup, these two provisions constitute a dramatic departure from existing Federal Indian policy, which is based on promoting tribal economic development, tribal self-sufficiency, and 
strong tribal governments. Sections 118 and 120 would seek to condition the receipt of TPA funding, requiring in section 120 that Indian tribal governments unilaterally waive their immunity from any and all lawsuits. Further, section 118 would require all tribal governments that receive TPA funding to be subjected to a form of means testing analysis of all the available tribal resources as a determining factor in future TPA funding allocations. 
The nature of these provisions would suggest that because TPA funding constitutes approximately $760 million, or over half of the overall BIA operating budget, there needs to be some higher level of accountability to the Congress and to the taxpayer over how these funds are allocated and that the appropriate means to this end is the proposed blanket waiver of immunity and an imposed means testing formula allocation. 
I want to be very clear and try to inform my colleagues that the impacts of these provisions, if enacted, have yet to be fully contemplated. We can't begin to contemplate what effect they would have on the native American people. 
For example, with regard to a broad waiver of immunity, as proposed in section 120, we could ask several questions: 
What are the potential liabilities that would be incurred by the executive branch agencies who serve as the Federal trustees to Indian tribal governments and, therefore, would have to defend the tribal governments in lawsuits? 
What specific actions would become the purview of the Federal courts under a broad waiver of immunity? Is it limited to non-Indian disputes with Indian tribes, or could any and all intertribal disputes also be heard in Federal court? 
More importantly, what will be the impact on the Federal courts as a result of section 120? Would it simply clog the courts with more litigation? 
Further, regarding section 118, we should ask: 
What resources should be included in any analysis of how to better allocate TPA funding? 
Could the BIA begin to implement any alternative allocation method beginning in fiscal year 1998, which begins in just 2 weeks, without any public input or hearings? 
These are very practical problems that arise when addressing both of these provisions. It is for these reasons that I have strongly advocated that the appropriate authorizing committees be involved in finding practical solutions to these very complex issues. As the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I have made it very clear that I am committed to examining these issues through the hearing process. I have told that to Senator Gorton and have followed it with a letter to him guaranteeing that we would hear a bill and we would also attempt to have a markup by April 30, 1998. 
Madam President, I want to thank my colleagues for their wisdom in supporting this accommodation. 
I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set aside.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I am very pleased to offer this substitute amendment that our colleagues have worked on, which accomplishes several things. 
First of all, it holds the tribes harmless to the fiscal year 1997 TPA levels; it follows the recommendations of the 1994 Joint Tribal/DOI/BIA Task Force report by providing funding to the 309 small and needy Indian tribes; it provides $15.5 million for fixed costs and internal transfers; it provides for $17.1 million in increases to formula-driven programs; instead of having the BIA or the Congress allocate the remainder, it creates a mechanism comprised of Interior and BIA officials and tribal representatives from around the country to distribute the remaining $27.8 million. 
I think that is probably all we need for an explanation. 
With that, I move the amendment.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank Senator Inouye for those very thoughtful comments. Until he introduced a bill just a few years ago that established a museum of the American Indians as part of the Smithsonian--and I was a House sponsor when I was on the House side--until that happened, there was a common saying here in Washington, DC, by Indians throughout the Nation. That saying was, `There are more dead Indians in Washington than live ones.' It was because at that time there were over 16,000 remains, mostly skulls, but other body parts, housed by the Smithsonian. 
Senator Domenici, when he was here, I think put it in a good and proper perspective. We are dealing with a couple of sections. My primary opposition was not that I was trying to lock anybody out from debate, but I felt it was the wrong vehicle for putting these very, very important policy changes on an appropriations bill. But Senator Domenici put it in a proper perspective. Since he did, I will make a point of that, too. 
Senator Inouye mentioned the number of treaties that were dealt with. It is my understanding that 374 were ratified by the U.S. Senate and 374 broken--every single one--but not by the Indians. That is something that ought to be in a historical perspective when we talk about section 120 or 118. 
Most of the things that the Indians lost in the centuries past were done through two manners: either at gunpoint or through some subterfuge. Certainly if they had known the value 
of Long Island, they would never have sold it for $27 worth of beads. In the case of the Black Hills, they did not have a choice; it was at gunpoint, as many other lands were, too. 
Some authorities, including Herman Viola, head of the National Archives and a prominent author on American Indians, has written about 14 thoughtful books on American Indians, and he says in some writings that estimates are as high as 30 million aborigine people--30 million--died in North and Central America between 1492 and 1992--30 million. It was not like this place wasn't inhabited. There were complete nations. 
If you go back in history and you look at the great cities of Cahokia, which disappeared 400 years before the landing of Columbus, which had 20,000 acres in cultivated crops and astronomers, doctors, artists, and every imaginable kind of profession in their own way--gone, 400 years before anybody landed on a boat here from any of the European countries. 
The great city of Tenochtitlan, which the modern city of Mexico City is built on top of, had thousands of years of their own history before the coming of post-Columbian people. I live about half an hour from Mesa Verde, called the Cliff Dwellings. They were there before Christ walked the Earth, the people living on the mesas, planting their corn, raising their kids, praying to their Lord, passing on generation to generation. They left there almost 400 years before Columbus even got here. 
So when we talk about who owes what to whom around here, I think it is very important that we remember that Senator Domenici and Senator Inouye have tried to put this in a proper perspective. They were a culture. They did not have prostitution. They did not have jails. They did not have communicable diseases. They did not have unemployment. They did not have taxes, by the way, Mr. President. They did not have welfare, mental institutions, literally all of the social problems that we now think are consuming America, eating up America. They did not have those. They could not even swear. They could not even swear. They had no swear words in the Indian language. 
They were a pretty good culture. We could learn a lot from them. We did not learn very much because we found it was easier to take things at gunpoint or to get one to sell out another. That was common in those days. If the negotiators with the Federal Government could not talk some of the chiefs out of the land, they would simply say, `OK, we will set up our own chiefs. We will set up these guys over here. They belong to the tribe. We will say they are the guys that have the authority to sign the agreements and the treaties.' That is the way some of the land disappeared. 
If we decided we could not deal with the Government of France or Great Britain or any other foreign country, we would simply say, we will set up our own puppet leaders in your country and then we will sign an agreement with them and that will become the law of the land. That is how a lot of the land disappeared. 
They had none of these problems. It was not in their nature and it was not in their culture. They inherited it all. Many, many tribes are still trying to find their center, find their way, and make a better life for themselves and their kids. It is an uphill battle all the way because this Government, by and large, has never been very sensitive of their needs. 
If you remember, historically, in fact, the Bureau of Indian Affairs was not part of the Department of the Interior 
when it was set up. It was part of the Department of War. Do you think anybody that sets up a framework to try to find fairness after fighting decades of battle, where some of their own people were lost in their battles, do you think they will be fair? Probably not. 
That is what led to the rise of the Surgeon General in the 1800's asking the War Department to send out a request to collect body parts from American Indians. If they were already dead, that was OK, dig them up and send them in. If they were not, kill them and then send them in. The point of that whole study is a matter of historical record. It was to do one thing: They took measurements of the skulls, the bones; they measured how far apart were the eyes, and the cranial cavity and so on, and in their infinite wisdom decided, because those measurements were different from the Anglo majority of this country, they could not have had the intelligence to own land. That was one of the reasons and one of the driving forces of westward expansionism. 
I didn't want to get into a big history lesson here, but that is all a matter of record. 
It seems to me that if Senator Domenici and Senator Inouye did anything, they tried to put this in a proper perspective. There have been many, many bills and many laws passed dealing with American Indians where they have had very little input and no voice in this body. All they are asking now is to have a voice in this body by having these bills introduced in a legislative forum so they can speak to them, too, and not just slipped in in an appropriations bill. 
In the past, there have been many devastating laws passed by this Congress. Certainly one was simply called relocation. That was not so long ago, it just happened in the 1950's, in which Congress decided Indians had lived on reservations long enough and they could be assimilated, and they uprooted families and sent them to the city and taught them to be electricians, plumbers, automobile mechanics, and after they finished school, they dumped them on the streets of Los Angeles, New York, Fresno, and all over this country with no jobs and no skills or ability to get the jobs with which they could make a living doing the things they had been taught under relocation. 
That is the reason why we have such high alcoholism rates among urban Indians now, still to this day, 40 years after the relocation act. 
In its infinite wisdom, this body decided, through the Termination Acts of the 1950's, they would arbitrarily say the Indians have been living around the city long enough, therefore we will not call them Indians now but terminate them as a legal body. The heck with the whole treaties, the heck with what we agreed to, our word is no good, we will terminate them. I have never understood that. It is like telling a black American you have been around the cities long enough, you are no longer black. I don't know how they could have even done that, but they did it. 
To this day, many of those tribes that were terminated and left in limbo, not quite in the Anglo world and certainly not in the Indian world because they were no longer legally Indians, and they have been trying to find their center. That is why in the last few years we have allowed more and more tribes to go through the Bureau's procedure to be reinstated as tribes. 
I guess in closing I should say we do an awful lot around here based on the law book. It seems to me we ought to do a 
little more based on the Good Book. You can be legally right and morally wrong. Everybody in this body knows that. I think we can put something in place that might be legally right and stand up in any court of law, but we have to ask ourselves, was that the right thing to do? Was that a fair thing to do to 2 million people without their input, without them knowing, without them having a voice? I don't think so. 
If you look at the unemployment rate on the charts that Senator Gorton showed, it was 95 percent on the reservation in Pine Ridge, SD. When you talk about a 9 percent unemployment nationwide, this country comes unglued. We think we are in a major catastrophe if we have a 9 percent unemployment. Try 40, 50, 80, 90, or 95 percent, like in Pine Ridge, SD, and all the dysfunctional problems, including fetal alcohol syndrome. One out of five or six babies born is destined to lead a life in an institution because his mother drank too much because she didn't know the difference or did not know it would hurt her unborn baby. Try to apply those statistics to the outside world. 
Half of our high school kids don't finish high school. We have kids sniffing glue, eating paint, blowing spray paint in their face, burning our their mind. They don't know what they are doing because they have not had proper education or training. We have a suicide rate on some reservations where one out of every two girls, one out of every two, tries suicide before she is out of her teenage years, and one out of every three boys, and too many of them succeed. 
That is the historical perspective that I try to put this in when I say we went the wrong way in trying to add this to an appropriations bill with no input. I am delighted and honored that so many Senators came forward and spoke to this, and at least for this year, we got it right 
and we are telling people this Nation is no better than a human being when we give our word. We are now in the process of dealing with fast-track for NAFTA, expanding that; we dealt with the Chemical Weapons Ban Treaty, and we are dealing with another treaty dealing with landmines. They are all going to affect millions of people. It just seems to me that if this Nation can give their word in treaties to everybody else in the world that live halfway around the world, we can darn sure give our word to the first Americans and keep it. 
With that, Mr. President, I would like to get back to the amendment and clarify that. I did ask unanimous consent on the pending question that is now referred to as section 118, beginning on page 52, line 16; is that correct?

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I wasn't going to speak to that, but I might make one comment. As I read the language of the bill, there were so many unanswered questions. One that came to mind was this. As I understand section 120, tribes who did not want to give up their sovereign immunity would be denied Federal funds. If they did willingly give up Federal funds, then they would not have had to give up their sovereign immunity, which seemed strange to me because the tribes that are the most destitute and therefore the most dependent on Federal help, would have been the ones who would have had to give up immunity and therefore would have been sued more, where the very few, perhaps 1 out of 100, who do have a casino and have some money, simply would have said we don't want Federal money, we have enough; therefore, their immunity would have been intact. It seems that paradox should be the thing that we discuss in a proper forum, which is the committee legislation. 
With that, I have no further comments, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and other colleagues in recognition of Hispanic Heritage Month and to offer a few remarks regarding the Hispanic tradition in my home State of Colorado and their many contributions to our great country. 
To begin with, Colorado is the Spanish word for red, thus we owe the name of our State to Hispanics. The town where I live is Ignacio which is Spanish for Ignatius, and the county I live in is La Plata which is Spanish for silver. To the east you will find Alamosa, San Luis, Monte Vista, Antonio, Las Animas and La Junta, to name but a few towns in Colorado. 
As you can see, Mr. President, in my State it is next to impossible to look in any direction without being reminded of Hispanic heritage and influence. More than two thirds of the territory of the 48 contiguous States was discovered, settled or governed by Spanish speaking people. The Hispanic tradition in the United States is as new as the families who enter every year in search of a better life and as old as 1513 when Ponce de Leon landed on the east coast of the peninsula he called La Florida. 
Hispanics have enriched us with their cultural traditions and their commitment to la familia, the family. Their language, art, music, literature and food are today very much part of the American landscape. These contributions help make America stronger. 
Let us not forget their contributions in defense of our country. Hispanic blood has been spilled in every conflict and war since the Civil War when John Ortega of the U.S. Navy was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor on December 31, 1864, and as late as May 24, 1970 when it was awarded to Louis Rocco of Albuquerque, NM, for service in Vietnam. In between these two distinguished soldiers, Hispanics have been awarded 36 more medals making them the most decorated minority in our history proportionate to their numbers. Jose P. Martinez of Ault, CO, is also a past recipient of this highest honor we can bestow on our fighting men and women. 
Equality is a value central to the promise of America, and we must be conscious and proactive in insuring that equal opportunity is available to all who serve and contribute to the betterment of our country. Hispanics have fought for the idea and ideals of America and are deserving of an equal share of all of its rewards, not more, not less, but equal. That is the promise of America, and it is the promise we must make, and keep, to America's Hispanics. 
Mr. President, throughout my life, both personal and public, Hispanics have honored me with their friendship and support. It is with great pleasure I honor them here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in recognition of Hispanic Heritage Month.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, because the concept of nonacquiescence is so often mired and hidden in the bureaucratic processes of our Government agencies, few realize the magnitude of its true implications. I am extremely concerned that so many Federal agencies currently fail to comply with established case law when dealing with American's rights and legal claims. Instead, the very agencies whose function it is to serve the people of this country have been ignoring the law through the policy of nonacquiescence. Specifically, nonacquiescence occurs when an agency refuses to comply with judicial precedent and instead, relies on agency policy to determine the outcome of a claim. For example, if a beneficiary has a social security claim, the agency can rule against the claimant even if the judicial precedent in that circuit is entirely in favor of the beneficiary. Agency wins--claimant loses--end of story. The only recourse that beneficiary has is to relitigate that same issue in court. The beneficiary can't bypass the agency and go directly to court, because he or she must first exhaust all administrative remedies. This is an extremely expensive burden on any person with a claim against an agency. In fact, it is a financial burden on the entire judicial system and on the American taxpayer who eventually pays the cost of relitigation. 
Stare decisis--`let the decision stand'--is the fundamental doctrine of law upon which our entire judicial system is based. It is a concept of fairness and equity that has withstood the test of time. We require the American people and courts to adhere to judicial precedent. This policy of nonacquiescence completely undermines that principle. It allows the agency to completely ignore judicial precedent and instead rely solely on agency interpretation. The most glaring examples of nonacquiescence have surfaced in a select few agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Internal Revenue Service. This year alone, the Social Security Administration itself indicates that tens of thousands of claims involving nonacquiescence may be litigated. In a recent judicial opinion, the appellate judge stated that `if a [social security] claimant has the determination and financial and physical strength and lives long enough to make it through the administrative process he can turn to the courts * * *' and ultimately prevail. Similarly, the NLRB and the IRS have invoked this policy and were the subject of inquiry during a recent House hearing which investigated the alarming rise of agency nonacquiescence. 
The true residual dangers of the nonacquiescence policy, however, lie in its more far-reaching implications. Theoretically, any agency can invoke this policy to avoid the law. When the Bureau of Land Management recently proposed reform regulations for grazing permits, ranchers challenged the new provisions. After exhausting all administrative remedies, the ranchers took their case to court. Following lengthy and costly litigation, the appellate court ruled in favor of the ranchers. However, under the nonacquiescence policy, the BLM could refuse to abide by this ruling each and every time this issue arises. Now grazing permits may not seem like a big deal to people here in Washington, but like many Western States, more than 30 percent of all the land in my home State of Colorado is Government-owned and under the control of a Federal agency. In western Colorado, almost 60 percent of the land falls into this arrangement. A rancher waiting for a grazing permit may be unable to get a loan or conduct necessary planning, which could force that rancher out of the livestock industry altogether. At the very least, each time a claim is relitigated, it involves tens of thousands of dollars and years of financial uncertainty for the claimant. Such a refusal to adhere to judicial precedent sends a clear message to the American people--a message of unfairness and inequality which in turn breeds mistrust against the Government. If the people must adhere to judicial precedent, we should require no less of Government agencies. 
This problem has been around for decades, but Congress first addressed this issue when it was considering the Social Security Act of 1984. The conference report for that legislation highlighted the magnitude of concern over this policy when it stated: 
By refusing to apply circuit court interpretations and by not promptly seeking review by the Supreme Court, the Secretary forces beneficiaries to re-litigate the same issue over and over again in the circuit, at a substantial expense to both beneficiaries and the federal government. This is clearly an undesirable consequence. 
At that time, Congress allowed the agencies to address this problem internally rather than by statute. Now in 1997, 13 years later, nonacquiescence is alive and well and it would be a gross understatement to say that this problem continues to be an undesirable consequence. In fact, Congress' failure to act 13 years ago has allowed the nonacquiescence policy to grow into a bureaucratic nightmare. This is nothing less than bureaucracy run amuck. It is now our duty to address this situation before any more time and money is wasted. 
Because I believe it is important to hold Federal agencies accountable, today I am introducing legislation which would require a Federal agency to comply with Federal court precedents within the circuit where a claim is filed. However, this bill also allows an agency to deviate from such precedent under certain circumstances, thus giving the agency additional avenues when there is a conflict between judicial precedent and agency regulations. In contrast to the present policy of nonacquiescence, in which the general public has no additional avenue except to relitigate an issue at personal expense, my bill upholds the fundamental concept of stare decisis and will in turn provide stability, economy and equality for all Americans. 
The House version of this legislation was introduced earlier in this Congress by Congressman Gekas and Congressman Frank and has been reported favorably out of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. This bill is supported by the Judicial Conference of the United States, Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of Administrative Law Judges, and the American Bar Association. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. The amendment would dedicate an additional $100 million to research on Parkinson's disease, an effort driven by my accomplished mentor and dear friend, Morris K. Udall. 
The statistics are staggering. While over a million Americans battle Parkinson's at a cost of $26 billion annually, the Federal commitment to Parkinson's research is only $27 million. While it is not only impossible but unfair to try and determine what disease should get more funding for research while another gets less, these statistics say unequivocally that Parkinson's deserves more. 
While I have many fond memories of Mo, his thirty years of unparalleled service to this country, his ever present wit and his statesmanship, one of my fondest memories is of a circumstance in which he exhibited rarely matched courage and integrity. While both in the House of Representatives, I had the honor of crusading with Mo to remove a painting from a wall in the Capitol that was both offensive and demeaning to Native Americans. That painting, that symbol of dominance, hung for years. Mo Udall took it down. He took down many such injustices during his tenure in Congress. 
Parkinson's has robbed us of too many valuable people. I feel very strongly that the 64 Members of the Senate who cosponsored this bill should follow through on their initial--overwhelming--show of support and adopt the amendment.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to express my deep sorrow over the loss of Mother Teresa. At the age of 87, she had made infinite strides in promoting peace and goodwill throughout the world. In a long overdue gesture, the Senate recently bestowed upon Mother Teresa the Congressional Gold Medal for her role as head of the Missionaries of Charity. For a woman of her stature, it was a humble honor. 
As I listened this weekend to the many replays of interviews with Mother Teresa, I could not help but be stunned by endless depths of her compassion. Her desire to hug and touch people otherwise reviled by society, the strength of her hands and enormity of her presence despite her diminutive size, are just a few images which come to mind. Mother Teresa was a woman who measured and understood the rest of humanity in a way few, if any, others do. In recognizing her today, it is with reverence and the utmost respect for a person who labored as a living saint on behalf of mankind. 
She will never be forgotten. Her charitable mission will be carried on in her adopted home of India, as well as the dozens of countries where her works have been taken up by others. While Mother Teresa is irreplaceable, we can only hope to learn and live by her example in the future.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, back in May of this year, the leadership and the administration reached a historic agreement. That agreement was then supported overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate when the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998 came before the two bodies for consideration, putting forth the blueprint by which the Federal Government could reach a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
This week the Congress and the administration have reached yet another monumental agreement, ensuring passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and its companion, the Taxpayer Fairness Act. These two bills, together, put forth the spending and revenue changes for the next 5 years. And, the passage of these measures and their subsequent enactment into law will signify the first balanced budget since 1969. For 28 years, the Federal Government has run a deficit and has talked about the need to balance the budget. Finally, due to the extraordinary leadership of the House and Senate, as well as the incredible amount of bipartisanship and cooperation, Americans are witnessing the Federal Government take the necessary action to get its fiscal house in order. 
The tax portion of this agreement will provide Americans with the first major tax cut in 16 years. This bill provides for a net tax cut of more than $90 billion over the next 5 years. This is slightly more than the $85 billion agreed upon in the budget agreement of earlier this year, and I am delighted that the budget negotiators were able to provide a little extra for this country's hard-working families and individuals. 
Specifically, this bill is an investment in our children. After years of trying to get a child tax credit enacted, the Taxpayer Fairness Act will provide families with a $500 per child tax credit for children under the age of 17. Over the years I have received many a letter from Coloradans who are supportive of this tax credit, and finally, they are going to be able to take advantage of it. Imagine what a family of four can do with a $1,000 credit. They can use the money to invest in their two children's education. They can put the money toward a downpayment on a house or simply use the money to ease their financial burdens. This child tax credit will mean different things to each of the millions of families that is eligible for it. But what it means to me is that this Government cares enough about this country's children and the hard-working parents struggling to raise their children to offer them some much-needed and well-deserved tax relief. 
And the benefits for families and their children do not stop there. Once a child is ready to go on to higher education, millions of taxpayers will benefit from the tuition tax credit and millions more will benefit from the student loan interest deductions. 
Equally important to my home State of Colorado are the benefits from capital gains and estate tax relief. I cannot begin to quantify how many Coloradans--homeowners, small business owners, farmers, ranchers--have written or spoken with me over the years urging the Federal Government to ease the burden from these taxes, and while I would have liked to see these provisions go a little farther, I am pleased about the benefits this bill will bring to the many farmers, ranchers, and small business owners in my State. Capital gains and estate tax relief, in combination with other tax provisions in this bill including IRA expansion, will contribute to economic growth and create jobs, thereby once again assisting America's families. 
In all, the tax bill represents a major step forward for the economy as a whole and for the pocketbooks of taxpayers. Out of every dollar earned by an individual today, roughly 25 cents of that goes toward the individual's Federal tax burden--this is just the Federal taxes. And, today, we are going to do some truly significant by passing a bill which will provide major tax cuts, benefiting Americans at every stage of life. 
While the accompanying spending bill is more contentious by nature, it provides for several important and necessary reforms to our Nation's largest entitlement programs. The Medicare Program, which was facing certain insolvency within the next 5-year span of the balanced budget agreement, is now actuarially sound for the next decade. Most importantly, the savings achieved in the program are not unfairly achieved on the backs of beneficiaries, but rather through expanded choice, competition and a curbing of the rampant fraud and abuse. The Department of Health and Human Services cites $23 billion in fraud and waste under the current Medicare structure. This bill finally provides us with a mechanism to protect those taxpayer dollars. 
Further reforms in Medicaid, the section 8 assisted housing program, and improvements to the welfare to work legislation of last year have resulted in a historic starting point for meaningful and fair reform. I make no bones about my dissatisfaction with certain provisions included in the bill, as well as the exclusion of others, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address these concerns. However, the benefits and the great need for the reforms this legislation precipitates have won it my support. 
On a larger scale, this tax bill and the Balanced Budget Act, taken together, will finally get the budget balanced. Since first coming to Congress in 1987 as a Member of the House of Representatives, I have been a proponent of a balanced budget and have supported efforts to achieve this goal. And, I am pleased to be here today to be a part of this historic moment. I would be completely remiss if I did not acknowledge the hard work of the House and Senate leadership, including the chairmen and ranking members of the Budget and Ways and Means committees. In 10 years in Congress, I have never before witnessed a budget bill, and a balanced one at that, which has passed with such ease and cooperation. With that, Mr. President, I will vote for these two bills, and I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Indian Gaming Enforcement and Integrity Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation is to reform the current regulatory fee structure administered by the National Indian Gaming Commission [NIGC], the regulatory agency responsible for monitoring and regulating Indian tribal government gaming. The essence of any regulatory agency is in its ability to monitor activities within its purview and to act decisively in enforcing violations of the law. The NIGC is no different and it has depended on regulatory assessments and Federal appropriations to carry out these vital roles. 
When Congress enacted and the President signed into law, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act [IGRA], two principal goals were sought: To provide a statutory basis for the operation of Indian gaming as a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments; and, second, to provide a statutory basis for the regulation of the Indian gaming industry to shield it from corrupting influences. 
Since its enactment in 1988, the Indian gaming industry has grown tremendously, where today it is a multibillion dollar industry. As a result, the IGRA is beginning to provide many tribal governments with the wherewithal to provide basic services to their members. Where poverty once reigned on Indian reservations, economic opportunity now abounds. In many cases, tribal governments are able to employ large numbers of their own members, as well as non-Indians from surrounding communities. Further, it is no coincidence that in many communities around the Nation, welfare rolls have dropped and employment has risen as a direct result of tribal gaming. 
The second objective of the IGRA is to provide adequate regulation to shield Indian gaming from corruption influences and to ensure the games are fair, and conducted in accordance with all applicable laws. IGRA established the National Indian Gaming Commission and empowered it to monitor Indian gaming and to regulate certain aspects of Indian gaming. The act authorizes the Commission to assess regualtory fees on these gaming activities. In addition to these assessed fees, the act authorizes an annual Federal appropriation to complement the funds available for the efficient operation of the Commission. 
To date, the Commission is responsible for monitoring and regulating 273 Indian gaming establishments operated by 184 tribes in 28 States. While it attempts to keep up with this tremendous growth, the Commission is currently statutorily constrained from securing the level of funding it needs to fulfill its mandates under the law. 
Current law authorizes the NIGC to assess fees on class II gaming activities at a level not to exceed $1.5 million per year. In addition to Federal appropriations of $1 million over the last 3 fiscal years, and other fees collected, the NIGC has been operating on a budget that slightly exceeds $3 million. 
To further illustrate the funding dilemma of the NIGC, the Committee on Indian Affairs conducted an oversight hearing on July 10, 1997 to review the current Indian gaming regulatory fee structure. Testimony provided to the committee indicated that for fiscal year 1997, the Commission has an overall operating budget of $4.3 million which consists of, a $1 million direct appropriation, $1.5 million in fees assessed on class II tribal gaming revenue, and $1.8 million in unobligated funds from prior years. However, for fiscal year 1998 it is indicated that funds from prior year unobligated balances would be nearly depleted, resulting in a projected operational budget of $2.5 million to $3.0 million for fiscal year 1998. According to the NIGC, without additional funding reductions in staff would take place, with a commensurate decrease in its regulatory, compliance and enforcement efforts. 
Further, testimony indicated that greater resources need to be available to the NIGC in order to meet their statutorily mandated responsibilities. To accomplish this the NIGC proposed expanding their collection to class III gaming activities 
As a result of the hearing, I have developed legislation that reflects testimony provided by the NIGC and tribal interest. This legislation will require the NIGC to assess minimum mandatory fees on each gaming operation that conducts a gaming activity regulated under the act. In addition to these minimum fees, the Commission is authorized to assess fees on class II gaming and on class III gaming. In order to provide a reasonable fee assessment approach, the legislation provides for maximum rates of not more than 2.5 percent on the gross revenues of class II activities; and not more than .5 percent on the gross revenues of class III activities. 
In addition to these maximum rates, the bill provides for a phased in approach so that fees collected on class II activities shall not exceed $5 million in fiscal year 1998, $8 million in fiscal year 1999, and $10 million in fiscal year 2000. Similarly, fees collected on class III activities shall not exceed $3 million in fiscal year 1998, $4 million in fiscal year 1999, and $5 million in fiscal year 2000. 
The Commission is required to take into account its duties and the services it provides to Indian tribal gaming in setting the annual fees under the act. The legislation creates a special fund in the U.S. Treasury for amounts equal to the fees paid by the gaming operations, and requires that all amounts deposited into the special fund shall be used only to fund the activities of the Commission under the IGRA. Because the United States maintains a special relationship with the Indian tribes, and given its legitimate role in providing services to the tribes, the bill I am introducing retains a Federal appropriation to defray the costs incurred by the Commission in carrying out its duties under the IGRA. 
As I have stated before, it is our obligation to make sure that we protect the interests of Native Americans and, at the same time, protect the interest of those who participate in Indian Gaming. 
This legislation seeks to ensure the integrity of the Indian gaming industry by providing the tools necessary to the agency responsible for regulating this industry. That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it gives me great personal pleasure to introduce the Buffalo Nickel Commemorative Coin Act of 1997. I am also pleased to add Senators Inouye, Conrad, and Wellstone as cosponsors of this legislation. 
For those of us old enough to remember or for those who have seen one, the buffalo nickel holds a special place in history. This coin was in general circulation from 1913 to 1938, and it featured an Indian head design on one side with a buffalo design on the reverse. 
The coin's history is an interesting one, and I would like to share it with my colleagues. The artist who designed this coin, James Earle Fraser, wanted to produce a coin which was truly unique and American. I believe Mr. Fraser put it best himself when he said, 
In designing the buffalo nickel, my first object was to produce a coin which was truly American, and that could not be confused with the currency of any other country. I made sure, therefore, to use none of the attributes that other nations had used in the past. And, in my search for symbols, I found no motif within the boundaries of the United States so distinctive as the American buffalo or bison. 
According to historical sources, the Indian head on the nickel was created by Mr. Fraser based upon three models: Iron Tail, an Oglala Sioux; Two Moons, a Northern Cheyenne; and Big Tree, a Seneca Iroquois. Supposedly all three Indians were performers appearing in wild-west shows in New York City at the time they posed for Mr. Fraser. 
As for the buffalo, historians generally agree that the model was Black Diamond, a bull bison residing in the Central Park Zoo. Unfortunately, after being immortalized on the buffalo nickel, Black Diamond was slaughtered. 
The end result was a coin which was, indeed, truly unique. It has been roughly 60 years since the U.S. Bureau of the Mint ended production of the buffalo nickel. The bill I am offering today would direct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a limited-edition commemorative buffalo nickel coin to begin in the year 2000. I believe it is fitting to reintroduce this beloved coin to new generations of Americans. 
These coins will also serve another important purpose appropriate to its heritage. Profits from the sale of the coins will go to the endowment and educational funds of the National Museum of the American Indian. Authorized in 1989 by the National Museum of the American Indian Act, Public Law 101-185, the museum is set to begin construction in order to meet its scheduled opening date in the year 2002. The facility, to be located on the Mall here in Washington, DC, will house over 1 million artifacts and is expected to draw millions of visitors each year. By contributing funds to the endowment and educational programs of the museum, the buffalo nickel will be assisting with the preservation of native artifacts and offer visitors to the museum the opportunity to appreciate and learn more about native cultures. 
The origins of this bill actually began some time ago when an individual contacted my office with this idea. Following that, my friend and former colleague, Tim Wirth, sent me a note saying he thought it was a great idea, and since then I have received hundreds of postcards from people across the country expressing their desire to see the return of the buffalo nickel. With that, I am pleased to be able to introduce this legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues, the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee, and the U.S. Treasury in order to make the buffalo nickel a success.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will address a significant consumer issue--the unauthorized change of telecommunications subscribers from one carrier to another, otherwise known as slamming. 
Consumers have the right to choose their primary long distance company and to change companies whenever they wish. Sometimes a consumer's telecommunications company is changed without the consumer's knowledge or consent, a practice known as slamming. As competition among telecommunications carriers has increased, so has the number of complaints arising from unauthorized or unknowingly authorized changes of consumers' telecommunications carriers. 
To give an idea of the scope of the problem, the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] reports that it received over 1,700 complaints during fiscal year 1993. By 1995, that number had escalated to over 38,000 consumer telephone complaints and over 25,000 written complaints. In fact, the FCC says slamming complaints are their fastest growing category of consumer complaint, and my home State of Colorado ranks among the top five States in 1996 slamming complaints per million customers. 
The FCC reports that a slammed consumer may lose important service features, get lower quality service, or be charged higher rates for his or her telephone calls. Slamming also distorts the telecommunications competitive market by rewarding companies that engage in deceptive and misleading marketing prices. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 includes provisions designed to reduce slamming, and it charges the FCC to adopt rules to implement these provisions. 
The bill I am introducing today will give teeth to the Commission's efforts to curb slamming. I firmly believe that enforcement, streamlined processing of slamming complaints, and consumer education will help stem the tide of unauthorized carrier changes. 
My bill, the Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997, imposes a deadline of April 30, 1998 for the completion of the FCC's rulemaking on slamming. 
Currently, the Telecommunications Act does not define a deadline for action, and one is needed to ensure that 
consumers are protected as soon as possible from companies that engage in deceptive marketing practices. Nine months is sufficient time for the FCC to build a full record, solicit input from all interested parties, and put forth new antislamming rules. 
My legislation directs the FCC, in its rulemaking, to develop rules and regulations regarding penalties and liabilities--including substantial fines or forfeitures under section 503 of the Communications Act--for the unauthorized switching of a customer's preferred telecommunications carrier. 
It also directs the FCC to consider whether telecommunications carriers should be required to set up toll-free numbers dedicated to reporting unauthorized long distance carrier switches, with the obligation for a customer service representative to answer incoming calls within 2 minutes. 
I support such a toll-free number with call answering standards. Requiring consumers to pay for a call to report a slamming incident or having them endure a long wait before speaking to a customer service representative, would pose real barriers to accurate reporting. 
My legislation further directs the Commission to consider a process that would secure facts and statistical data from telecommunications carriers related to the number of consumer complaints they receive regarding slamming. 
By October 31, 1998, the bill directs the FCC to report to Congress the identities of those telecommunications carriers that represent the 10 top slammers for 1997--based on the ratio of annual customer complaints regarding unauthorized carrier changes to the total number of customers served by such carriers. 
It is my hope that such a list will serve as an effective deterrent to companies contemplating deceptive marketing campaigns. Negative publicity could be the best defense in the fight against slamming. 
This report also should identify whether telecommunications carriers have been assessed fines or forfeitures by the Commission--including the amount of the fine or forfeiture, and whether the assessment was the result of a full prosecution or pursuant to a consent decree. 
After the first report in October 1998, the bill requires an annual report be submitted by the FCC to Congress each April 30. 
Before Congress takes more dramatic action in this regard, my bill would look to the FCC for its recommendations on the following issues: Whether consumers should be provided a private cause of action, with minimum statutory penalties, relating to unauthorized slamming; whether the FCC's current fine and forfeiture authority is sufficient to meaningfully address and curb actions of telecommunications carriers that engage in slamming; and what penalties should be applied to telecommunications carriers which switch a customer's preferred telecommunications carrier without a customer's 
authorization either willfully and knowingly or by means of a forged document? 
It is simply unfair for unsuspecting consumers, especially senior citizens, who in good faith select a long distance carrier only to have their long distance phone service changed without their knowledge. Slamming is unfair and against the law. My bill will help protect consumers from this unfair practice.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation to extend and improve the native American veteran direct loan pilot program. I am pleased to add Senators Johnson, Domenici, and Hatch as cosponsors of this legislation. 
America's most important resource has always been the individuals willing to lay down their lives for their country. Throughout our history we have been blessed with men and women willing to put themselves at risk for the greater good. 
Native Americans have been proud to be a part of this Nation's defense. From the revolutionary era to our ongoing peacekeeping missions around the globe, native Americans have served and continue to serve the United States honorably. It may surprise some members to know that native Americans served, suffered, and died in service to this Nation even though they were not allowed to be citizens until 1924. 
As a veteran I feel a special kinship with all those men and women who served this Nation in peacetime and in war. As an Indian veteran I am keenly aware of the dedicated service Indians, Alaskans, and Hawaiians have given--often without recognition of their sacrifice. 
How can we compensate these men and women for making the greatest sacrifice they could? There is no dollar value we can place on a life. At the very least, we must provide the basic benefits of health care, housing, and education to those that laid down their lives for America. 
Since 1992, the Department of Veterans Affairs has operated a direct housing loan program to help native America veterans build decent homes. I was amazed to find out that in the last 5 years, that program had provided eight Indian veterans with loans. 
That is not an indication that all Indian veterans have no housing needs. During a hearing on veterans issues, members of the Indian Affairs Committee saw videotape of the houses used by Navajo veterans. They looked like something you would see in a Third World nation, not America. Houses had holes in their roofs and walls and plastic sheets for windows. Many houses do not have working plumbing and water has to be carried from miles away. This is certainly not the appreciation and respect war veterans deserve. 
Native Americans seeking home loans face many obstacles unique to Indian country, including poor economic conditions and the fact that the land cannot be used as collateral. But the most surprising revelation at the committee's hearing was that the majority of Indian veterans seem to have little or no knowledge that the VA's direct loan program exists. If they do, many do not know how or where to apply. The Government has no problem finding these men and women when it is time to draft them to fight in a war. But when it is time to pay them back for their sacrifice, the effort just is not there. 
That is why the bill I introduce today does more than extend the direct loan program for 3 years. It includes measures to boost the Department of Veterans Affairs' efforts to implement the direct loan program for native American veterans. The bill places new requirements on the Department to consult with tribal organizations, native veterans organizations, and other groups prior to making decisions under the act. It also expresses Congress's desire that the Department carry out vigorous outreach and education efforts to inform potential beneficiaries of the housing assistance benefits under the act. The bill requires the Department to submit annual reports to the Committee on Indian Affairs, the House Resources Committee, and the Veterans' Committees of both Chambers containing a description of the outreach activities undertaken by the VA on a regional basis, with a second mandate that the VA conduct an assessment of how effective these efforts have been in encouraging greater use of the loan program. 
We must honor the service and sacrifice of our warriors. We must recognize the sacrifice they have made for all of us. The direct loan program is an ambitious idea designed to help our veterans with the most basic human need: a roof over their heads. It should not sit unused because of bureaucratic complacency. It is my hope that this reauthorization, with the appropriate changes, will jumpstart the Department's efforts to make the program available to native veterans and help them use it. I believe it is the least we can do. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Kohl, and I are bringing before the Senate today the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Department of the Treasury, U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, and certain independent agencies. The bill we are presenting today contains a total funding of $25,206,539,000. This is $1,104,116,000 more than the fiscal year 1997 level, and $455,866,000 less than the President's request. We are recommending a total of $12,321,339,000 in discretionary spending and $12,885,100,000 for mandatory programs over which this subcommittee has no control. 
Reaching this level has not been an easy task, and I certainly thank Senator Kohl, who has yet to arrive on the floor, for his hard work and continuing support and advice as we put this bill together. 
Mr. President, this bill includes $11,315,801,000 for the Department of the Treasury. As my colleagues are aware, the Department of the Treasury has a wide range of responsibilities directed not only at the revenues and expenditures of the Government, but law enforcement functions as well. 
The Treasury Department is responsible for 40 percent of all Federal law enforcement, and adequate funding for this function has been a priority for both Senator Kohl and myself. The subcommittee has done what we can to ensure that law enforcement agencies funded in this bill have the resources to do the job that we asked them to do in the so-called war against crime. In addition, we have provided a total of $131 million in the violent crime reduction trust fund. This is $12.7 million more than requested by the President and $34 million more than provided in fiscal year 1997. 
This bill includes $121,124,000 for payments to the U.S. Postal Service to reimburse them for providing free mail for the blind and for overseas voters and for payment to the Department of Labor for disability costs incurred by the old Post Office Department. 
The Executive Office of the President and funds appropriated to the President total $485,225,000. This includes the Office of Drug Control Policy. 
As many of our colleagues know, the bill includes the administration's proposal for a 1-year moratorium on new construction projects through the General Services Administration Federal Buildings Fund. It is unfortunate, when we need so many renovations on courthouses, that the GSA calculation of rent income to the Federal building fund has been so inaccurate in the past years that we are at a point where there is just barely enough money to continue ongoing projects. 
There is also $12.7 billion in mandatory payments through the Office of Personnel Management for annuitants' life and health insurance, as well as retirement benefits. 
There has been considerable discussion over the past couple of years about the funding level for the Internal Revenue Service. Many of us are very disturbed that significant amounts of money, over $4 billion, was wasted on the tax modernization system. As a result, we have very carefully reviewed the budget request from the IRS. We believe that the IRS should have sufficient resources to maintain and even increase customer service levels, and there must be enough to continue efforts to collect taxes due. As a result, we have proposed appropriations at the level requested by the President for the three permanent accounts. However, we did not agree to the President's request for an advance appropriation of $500 million to set up an account for future computer modernization efforts. 
Although the IRS has developed and circulated a modernization blueprint, that is only a first good step. It was the judgment of the subcommittee that there must be more detailed information before we agree to additional funds for future computer modernization. 
The most critical problem facing IRS is a century date change project. As a result, we have set aside $325 million for this effort, in addition to funds already appropriated in fiscal 
year 1997 and requested for fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, this bill is the result of long, hard hours of work on the part of the members and staff of this subcommittee. I want to thank them for all of their efforts. I believe we have put together a very worthwhile bill and hope we will have the support of the Senate. 
I now yield to our ranking member, my good friend, Senator Kohl.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, several Senators have said they wish to speak on this issue. Senator Byrd has indicated he would like to. He is in a meeting and will not be here for a short period of time. But those Senators who would like to make comments on that, we will do that. And we will take something else up if he does not get here in a reasonable time. 
I would like to point out to my colleague from Kansas that this issue of so-called pay raises has always interested me. As I looked up some of the figures, I am sure that most of my colleagues are aware that they do not have to take the cost-of-living increase allowance. They can turn it back to the Treasury if they do not want it. They can give it to charities. There are all kinds of things they can do with it. 
But to put it in some perspective, since it seems to get an awful lot of discussion, particularly in election years, about Congress people and Senators getting an increase in salaries, I thought I would contact the Congressional Research Service and find out just how much taxpayers' money goes into salaries for Congressmen and Senators. 
They tell me that one-tenth of one penny--one-tenth of one penny--is the average amount a taxpayer pays to congressional salaries. 
I know some people think we are not even worth that much, so we probably did a good thing by passing this amendment on a voice vote. But I would like to point out a couple of things that might put it in perspective. 
For example, in Senator D'Amato's and Senator Moynihan's State, the great State of New York, the mayor of New York City earns $31,400 more than they do, the Senators of that State. 
In Dade County, FL, Senator Mack's and Senator Graham's State, the superintendent of the county gets $51,400 more than the Senators of that State or the Congressmen. 
The sheriff of Los Angeles County receives $88,400 more than anybody in the congressional delegation from California. 
I guess my message to the average voter would be, if you are really concerned about elected officials, you ought to look 
at all of them, top to bottom, and not just because Congress gets so much media attention whenever they deal with this COLA or so-called pay raise. 
Many of the other areas of the country--I do not have the numbers right in front of me--but if you track the increases from 1970 to 1998, in fact, the amount that congressional salaries have increased has been less than postal workers, Social Security recipients, military wages, private-sector employees, Federal employees, most civilian employees, and literally everybody else. But I would like to put that in context. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves for her next appointment, I would like to make a couple of comments and ask her some questions. 
First of all, as I am sure she knows, I have always been a big supporter of increased money going into breast cancer research, as she has. And I commend her for the leadership she has taken on this issue. In fact, many of our colleagues have not only supported additional research money but have participated on our own time on Saturdays and Sundays in raising private funds for breast cancer research. The most common that we are aware of is the Susan Komen Foundation and The Run for the Cure, which is done all over the United States. 
Just a few weeks ago here in Washington, DC, we had something like 45,000 or 50,000 people that contributed money to run through the streets of Washington to help raise money for that very, very badly needed program. 
But I am a little concerned. She mentioned a few of the concerns already. But I am told that the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee, Senator Cochran, has some concerns about this proposal, as does Senator Stevens who will be here in about 25 minutes to make some comments on it, too. 
First, one of my concerns is certainly the administrative costs to the Postal Service. I think they would be significant, as I understand it. 
I would like to ask the Senator. Is there a provision that allows them to recoup their costs? Or does the whole profit of this additional cost of stamps just go to the program, and do they have to absorb the administrative costs for doing it? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-campbell-co-10-19970717</DOCNO>

Mr. CAMPBELL. A portion of 1 cent will go back to recover the cost. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-campbell-co-11-19970717</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I might also just comment that, as I understand it, if this 1-cent increase had been for the single best-selling stamp of all time--which was the Elvis Presley stamp that went on sale a couple of years ago, that stamp sold $500 million individual stamps--but if this 1-cent additional had been on that stamp, it would have raised only $5 million. Certainly that is an important amount but not as much as we need. As I also understand, only about 1.6 million breast cancer stamps have been sold so far. 
So the amount, I would tell my friend from California, that she would hope to realize from what I have heard and seen is probably going to be quite a bit less than she would hope to get into this account. 
The Senator already mentioned that there are some concerns by some of the Members that there are many, many programs that are equally important--muscular dystrophy, prostate cancer is important, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease--many things that we need to address some more. And I think, as some of my colleagues think, that we may be opening an avenue for all kinds of new groups to ask for the same kind of consideration. 
If that happens, then I think, No. 1, we are going to confuse the public and we will probably dilute the amount of money needed for any one of them. 
But I am not opposed to this amendment. I just wanted to make sure that my colleague understands that I am very supportive of her efforts. But I do have these concerns. 
I thank her, and I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair. I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
Mr. President, in the years I have been in the Senate, what has always interested me is the history of these desks. If you open these desks, as many of my colleagues have and most people who are students of history of the Senate know, inside the drawer literally every Senator who has served in the Senate has signed his name and noted the State from which he came. I often wonder, when I read the names of those Senators in the drawers and the little accompanying booklet that goes with it, how they voted on issues that affected the American Indian. 
In this particular desk, we will probably not know without extensive research how Senator Townsend or Senator Kean or Senator Goldsborough or Senator Brown or Senator Case or Senator Duff, to mention just a few who have used this desk, voted on American Indian issues. But during the days when `Manifest Destiny' was the national watchword, I wonder if they voted with the pack to take away the last remaining land and water possessions and freedom of the American Indian, or did at least a few show courage and stand up for fairness by protecting a people who could no longer defend themselves. I wonder, did they subscribe to Abraham Lincoln's creed that `all men are created equal,' or was the jingo of Andrew Jackson's day, `The only good Indian is a dead Indian,' their guiding principle? 
Today, I stand at the desk of my friend and colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, from New Mexico, who is managing this bill on the majority side. Senator Domenici is known nationwide in Indian country for his fairness and leadership in making sure that the lives of the American Indians are just a little better. And to my left, Senator Reid of Nevada, who is managing for the minority side, has the same reputation. I am very gratified that they are here in the Chamber with us today. I am hopeful that the attitude exemplified by these two outstanding senators, the new enlightened attitude, marks a change for the entire senate from that attitude of those forgotten Senators whom I mentioned earlier and upon which they made their decision concerning the first Americans. 
We do not intentionally kill Indians with bullets or disease anymore. But it seems clear that some of our brothers still want to kill their livelihood, kill their opportunity, kill their future, kill their culture, and kill their natural resources that we promised them in every one of the 472 treaties that we then broke as an arm of the U.S. Government. And, by the way, 
Mr. President, American Indians broke none of them. 
I guess what amazes me the most about those who advocate taking away what little American Indians have left are often Senators who neither have the institutional memory of the 1968 authorizing act of the Animas-La Plata or the 1988 bill that I carried 10 years ago which implemented a compromise agreement that was signed into law and has been supported by every President since 1988. These Senators are often ones who have never even seen an Indian reservation. 
To them, I would say go out and spend some time in an Indian community that has a 75-percent unemployment rate, as one reservation in Senator Reid's State, in Owyhee, NV, does have. Speak to families whose children have dropped out of school and then committed suicide as an escape from a hopeless, dark future. 
One out of every two teenage girls and one out of every three teenage boys try suicide in their teenage years in some reservations. This is not a Third World country I am speaking about. It is a daily experience for many American Indians in this, the greatest country on the face of the Earth. 
Go out and speak to the social workers inundated with problems of a depressed culture and little resources to help. Listen to the frustrated tribal council members who try to cope with fetal alcohol syndrome, a rate so bad that on some reservations one out of every four Indian babies born suffers from some degree of fetal alcohol syndrome, some to such a degree that they have to be institutionalized for life at the taxpayer's expense. 
All of those problems, Mr. President, were inherited as side effects of what was called `westward expansion,' and the ensuing lack of opportunity continues to this day. I would tell my colleagues to go out there and experience hunger and sickness that is a daily experience for all too many American Indians. And then come back here to this floor and tell their colleagues how we do not owe Indians anything. But do not tell us that you are doing it in their best interest or in the interest of saving taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, all they have to do is look at the amount we spend now in Federal programs, about $1.5 billion through the Bureau of Indian Affairs last year and about $2 billion through the Indian Health Service. Almost all of it is to help a people who have become dependent on Federal programs through no cause of their own. 
We will soon debate in this Chamber, Mr. President, the expansion of NATO and the billions of dollars that expansion will cost the American taxpayer, and as sure as I am standing here, some on this floor will support that expenditure of all those billions and still vote to take away the last best chance for economic independence for the Southern Utes and the Ute Mountain Utes right here in my State of Colorado. 
When we speak of spending taxpayers' money, where is it written that all those billions that go to foreign countries are justified when we cannot find a pittance to help American Indians? 
The Animas-La Plata is an agreement that must be honored. Not only did the tribes agree to the project but the States of Colorado and New Mexico did, too, a number of water conservancy districts did, and nine Federal agencies all agreed to the compromise of 1988. We are now being asked to compromise a compromise of the original 1968 authorization. Congress approved the settlement agreement in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Settlement Act of 1988 and President Reagan signed it into Public Law, and it has been supported by every President since. 
The only thing we are asking in this appropriations bill is what the President has in his budget. Too many people are dependent on this project, both Indian and non-Indian, to simply disregard it. Anyone from the American West can tell you, and particularly the American Indian, water is life. Water is the lifeblood of our future. This settlement fulfills the rights of tribes for water on the reservation. It settles disputes and removes causes for future litigation. It secures the tribes' opportunity to generate revenue from the use of reserve rights obtained under the agreement and authorizes them to sell or exchange or lease some of their water. 
Construction of the Animas-La Plata water project is essential to that settlement. If the project is not completed by the year 2000--and it is highly likely it may not be now, since the agreement was 1988 and the agreement stipulated they would start construction by 1990 and we are already behind by 7 years--the tribes have the option to go back to court to pursue their original claims in both the Animas and La Plata Rivers. Their victory in court would be certain and would trigger years of costly litigation among the United States, the State of Colorado, and water right holders throughout the region, wreaking havoc on the economies and water administration in Colorado. 
I might also point out that when we get into that expensive litigation at taxpayers' expense, it is going to be one Federal agency suing the other Federal agency, because the Bureau of Indian Affairs is responsible for protecting the Indian people, as you know. They will be suing the Bureau of Reclamation for noncompliance. Guess who pays for the expensive attorneys on both sides of the equation? 
The Supreme Court has held, in Winters versus the United States, that the United States, if the United States enters into a treaty with an Indian tribe creating a reservation, it impliedly reserves sufficient water to irrigate the reservation lands. Based on that doctrine, which mandates that Indian tribes get water, not money, the United States in 1976 filed reserved water right claims on behalf of both tribes. These reserved water rights would have preempted the vested water rights of non-Indian water users in the San Juan River Basin, drying up family farms and ranches that have existed in that area for years and years. 
You can imagine how the non-Indian people feel about tribes going back to court and exerting their rights. They have these priority rights because they were there first, and they rarely lose in courts. 
The Indian tribes do not want to go back to court. Their neighbors do not want them to go back in court. They, instead, chose to settle, and that is what the 1988 agreement was about. It is just lucky, I think, for the majority of the people in our area that the Ute Indians continue to give in the same generous spirit that they once gave their land and lives to build this great Nation. 
In looking at the Feingold amendment, it is simply divided into two parts. The first part is a diversion and the second part is a killer. 
Mr. President, let's not add to the dismal record of our treatment of the American Indians. Let's do the right thing and defeat the Feingold amendment. 
With that, Mr. President, I move to table the Feingold amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I appreciate that. Then I would like to make the record clear, Mr. President, that I have met with the tribal representatives today, and they are absolutely opposed to this amendment. They have `an alternative proposal,' but if it should be looked at, it should be done fully through the authorizing committee as a bill, open to public hearings, and not put into an appropriations bill where no one has the time to read it. I haven't even read the proposal myself, and I live there. 
So there will be no mistake, the tribes today, as of today, said they oppose this amendment.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I forgot to have printed in the Record earlier in my comments two editorials from our State's two major newspapers: one from the Rocky Mountain News dated Thursday, July 10, the headline saying: `The Utes' Generous Offer.' It is an editorial dealing with how fair and understanding and conciliatory the Utes have been in the whole question of building this project. The other editorial I would like to have printed in the Record is from the Denver Post, which is our State's largest newspaper, and the headline is very simply: `Double-crossing the Utes.' 
Let me read one paragraph from that very strong editorial: 
The real question now is simply: How many times do Animas-La Plata opponents think they can double-cross the Utes? 
When the Utes asked for a $714 million project, opponents said a $264 million project would do. When the Utes offered to accept a $257 million project, the opponents then dangled the vague hope of a $167 million handout. If Animas-La Plata opponents now succeed in killing even the Utes' own scaled-down plan, would they really have any incentive to keep even that promise? 
The answer is no.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many crimes in our country are being committed with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in a number of recent studies and news reports. Therefore, today I am introducing the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997 to increase the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws. 
Reports indicate almost half a million guns are stolen each year. As of March 1995, there were over 2 million reports in the stolen gun file of the FBI's National Crime Information Center including 7,700 reports of stolen machine guns and submachine guns. In a 5 year period between 1987 and 1992, the National Crime Victimization Survey notes that there were over 300,000 incidents of guns stolen from private citizens. 
 Studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms note that felons steal firearms to avoid background checks. A 1991 Bureau of Justice Statistics survey of State prison inmates notes that almost 10 percent had stolen a handgun, and over 10 percent of all inmates had traded or sold a stolen firearm. 
This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice Department study of juvenile inmates in four States shows that over 50 percent of those inmates had stolen a gun. 
In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation receives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this month, the Bureau has a total of 34,825 firearms on its unrecovered firearms list. 
All of these studies and statistics show the extent of the problem of stolen guns. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will increase the maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws. 
Specifically, my bill increases the maximum penalty for violating four provisions of the firearms laws. Under section 922(i) of title 18 of the United States Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. Under section 922(j) of title 18, it is illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, or otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. 
The penalty for violating either of these provisions, as provided by section 924(a)(2) of title 18, is a fine, a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, or both. My bill increases the maximum prison sentence to 15 years. 
The third provision, set forth in section 922(u) of title 18, makes it illegal to steal a firearm from a licensed dealer, importer, or manufacturer. For violating this provision, the maximum term of imprisonment set forth in 18 U.S.C. 924(i)(1) would be increased to a maximum 15 years under my bill. 
And the fourth provision, section 924(l) of title 18, makes it illegal to steal a firearm from any person, including a licensed firearms collector. This provision also imposes a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. As with the other three provisions, my bill increases this maximum penalty to 15 years. 
In addition to these amendments to title 18 of the United States Code, the bill I introduce today directs the United States Sentencing Commission to revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to these firearms offenses. 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding gun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the illegal use of firearms. 
The `Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997' will send a strong signal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. And, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank the distinguished managers of S. 936, the Department of Defense authorization bill, for incorporating my amendment to authorize the flying of the POW/MIA flag over certain Federal facilities and post offices. 
This amendment contains the text of S. 528, the bill I introduced on April 9, 1997. I am pleased that 23 of our colleagues joined in cosponsoring S. 528. These cosponsors include Senators Conrad, Cleland, Kempthorne, Warner, Collins, Moseley-Braun, Torricelli, Faircloth, D'Amato, Stevens, Hutchinson, Smith, DeWine, Lott, McConnell, Murkowski, Gregg, Lautenberg, Allard, Shelby, Craig, Grams, and Ashcroft. 
This amendment would authorize the POW/MIA flag to be displayed over military installations and memorials around the Nation and at other appropriate places of significance on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and on the last business day before each of the preceding holidays. A similar amendment was included in the House of Representatives Defense authorization bill. 
Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families POW/MIA flag. Displaying this flag would be a powerful symbol to all Americans that we have not forgotten--and will not forget. 
As you know, the United States has fought in many wars and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by enemy or listed missing in action. In 20th century wars alone, more than 147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners of war; of that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to this number, those who are still missing in action, we realize that more can be done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country. 
The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but for their families who personally carry with them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they remember the loyalty and devotion of those who served. 
As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the remembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and most noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and gratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom. 
I thank the managers of the DOD authorization bill for their assistance with this amendment and urge its immediate adoption. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I support a bill to correct a serious problem made apparent by the recent conviction of Timothy McVeigh for his cowardly act of terrorism. I was in the process of drafting a bill on this issue, but in light of the scope of the bill proposed by the Veteran's Committee chairman, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of this legislation to accomplish my goals. 
Our Nation remains outraged at that terrorist act and the individual who was convicted of committing it. We now are further outraged at the thought of that person being eligible for burial in a military cemetery beside our fallen brothers and sisters. 
As you well know, Mr. President, these military burials function to honor the brave men and women who have placed themselves in harm's way in order to defend our freedom and the system of government that has protected us for more than 200 years. As a Korean war veteran and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am personally aware of the sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform to serve and protect these freedoms. 
When anyone seeks to destroy our system of government by acts of terrorism, it is certainly a slap in the face to those who have served to protect freedom. Allowing that individual to be buried alongside truly honorable veterans is not only an injustice, it is disrespectful of the memory of those buried in our military cemeteries and to their families who sacrificed as well. 
This bill, introduced by Senator Specter, expands the criteria by which a veteran should be denied benefits and although I had planned to introduce such a bill, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 923 to be absolutely certain that any individual convicted of a crime as heinous as the Oklahoma City bombing will never be buried among our Nation's heroes. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, the Oklahoma City bombing trial of Timothy McVeigh has concluded in Denver. The jury found McVeigh guilty on all 11 counts against him, and he has been sentenced to death. 
Now that these proceedings are over, I take this opportunity to call to the attention of my colleagues the outstanding service of Chief Judge Richard Matsch who presided over the Oklahoma City bombing trial at a time when many of us here in this body are considering the appointment process for Federal judges. His leadership has provided many Americans a renewed faith in the judicial process. His example of fair, firm leadership is an outstanding model we should consider for future Federal judicial appointments. 
Many members of the legal profession and the media predicted that the Oklahoma City bombing trial would last 4 months. Under Judge Matsch's calm, competent direction, the trial concluded in only 2 months. 
Judge Matsch has an impressive legal career. He was associate editor of the law review at the University of Michigan School of Law. After law school, he joined the U.S. Army and became an intelligence officer. When he left the Army, he moved to Denver where he was in private practice. Judge Matsch went on to become a city attorney, a Federal prosecutor, and a bankruptcy judge before President Nixon nominated him to the Federal bench in 1974. In 1994 he was elevated to chief judge. 
Judge Richard Matsch has earned the admiration of his colleagues and lawyers who have appeared before him. Lawyers and colleagues from the bench praised the choice of Matsch to preside over the trial noting that he has the appropriate judicial temperament. One attorney who has argued before him said poetically, Judge Matsch `is better than indoor plumbing.' 
In light of the skillful and professional way Judge Matsch handled the proceedings of the McVeigh trial, I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the contributions of Judge Matsch to our justice system and commending him for his firm, swift justice in such a tragic case. He has touched the lives of many Americans with his outstanding service, and has renewed the faith in all of us that justice can be served. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today, I lend my support of the resolution my colleague Senator Domenici has introduced to bring the quality of Indian education on par with the rest of America. Increasing the quality of education available to our Native American youth will go far in solving many of the problems facing tribal governments and Indian people. 
This resolution acknowledges that the facts are discouraging. Indian youth lead all ethnic and racial groups in drop-out and poverty rates. Their juvenile delinquency rate continues to grow faster than the rest of young people in America. Both Indian reservation and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools are severely underfunded from a programmatic standpoint. These schools attempt to provide services to their children in spite of substandard facilities--facilities that no parent should have to send their child to and that no teacher should have to work in. These schools are understaffed and Indian educators are sorely underpaid. 
As this resolution makes clear, the United States has a moral and legal obligation to provide or aid tribal governments in providing quality education to American Indian and Alaskan Native youth. This responsibility is recognized in treaties, Executive orders, court decisions, and statutes. Yet, the disturbing facts that I have just mentioned make it clear that this obligation is not being met. It is my hope that this resolution will be the first step in building awareness of the current state of Indian education that will allow us to focus on a pragmatic solution. 
The importance of Indian education cannot be overstated. It holds the key to solving the most prevalent and devastating problems in Indian country: grinding poverty and the absence of opportunity for Indian youth. 
I am drafting legislation to address the unemployment problem on reservations by helping tribes create jobs and attract businesses. But in addition to a lack of capital and an abundance of regulatory obstacles, tribes face the challenge of filling jobs with trained people. Education and job creation must go hand-in-hand if tribes are to improve the standard of living for their members. Only through education will Indian tribes be able to solve problems such as unemployment, economic development, and achieving higher standards of living. 
At a recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, a member of the Office of Juvenile Justice stated in his testimony that `while violent crime is falling in American cities, it is rising on American Indian reservations.' Additionally, a report released by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center reveals that over the past 5 years gang related crimes, in the form of drive-by-shootings and homicides, have increased by more than 500 percent in some Indian communities. Mr. President, it must be understood that many of the problems facing Indian youth today center on the erosion of their culture. Too often, Indian children lack pride in who they are, where they live, and where they come from. This lack of self-esteem has caused consequences that ripple through the lives of Indian youth such as high drop-out rates and a growing juvenile delinquency and gang problem. As we resolve to better the quality of education for Indian children, we must strive to do so while acknowledging the importance of promoting Indian culture. 
Mr. President, as the 105th Congress proceeds, I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am voting in favor of the Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I commend our colleagues, the chairmen of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, Senator Stevens and Congressman Livingston, for their determination, hard work, and leadership on this important bill. 
And, as a member of the Senate-House Conference Committee, I appreciate the cooperative efforts of my counterpart, Congressman Kolbe, the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government. I also appreciate the valuable work of my colleague, Senator Kohl, who serves as the ranking member of the Treasury and General Government Subcommittee. 
This bill includes much needed assistance to our fellow Americans who have been hard hit by natural disasters. I am also pleased that the conferees agreed to include two of my provisions which are vital to my home State of Colorado. 
The first provision includes $1.95 million to support law enforcement efforts during the Denver Summit of Eight which is occurring later this month. This historic economic summit, which includes Russia for the first time as an active participant, will draw the leaders of the world's leading economies and thousands of other participants and guests. The funding which this supplemental includes will reimburse our police officers who are on the frontlines in providing the necessary security for the Summit of Eight. 
The second provision delays the implementation by the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] of a Medicare Competitive Pricing Demonstration project in Denver. The project, originally set to begin in January 1998, was ill-conceived in its design and had the potential to disrupt and reduce benefits for over 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries. My colleagues and I are all committed to successfully testing competitive pricing as an alternative reimbursement mechanism for Medicare risk contractors. It is for that very reason I sought a delay and appreciated the resounding support of my Senate and House colleagues. 
In light of the importance of this supplemental appropriations bill, I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. 
Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch and Senator Craig as original cosponsors of this legislation. 
This bill would both authorize States to recognize each other's concealed weapons laws and would exempt qualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms. This legislation is designed to support the rights of States and to facilitate the right of law-abiding citizens as well as law enforcement officers to protect themselves, their families, and their property. 
The language of this bill is similar to a provision in S. 3, the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1997, introduced earlier this year by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. In light of the importance of this provision to law-abiding gunowners and law enforcement officers, I am introducing this freestanding bill today for the Senate's consideration and prompt action. 
This bill allows States to enter into agreements known as compacts to recognize the concealed weapons laws of those States included in the compacts. This is not a Federal mandate; it is strictly voluntary for those States interested in this approach. States would also be allowed to include provisions which best meet their needs, such as special provisions for law enforcement personnel. 
This legislation would allow anyone possessing a valid permit to carry a concealed firearm in their respective State to also carry one in another State, provided that the States have entered into a compact agreement which recognizes the host State's right-to-carry laws. This is needed if you want to protect the security individuals enjoy in their own State when they travel or simply cross State lines to avoid a crazy quilt of differing laws. 
I use my own experience in Colorado as a former deputy sheriff and as a person who just lives 9 miles from the New Mexico border and within an hour's drive of both Arizona and Utah as a person who is caught in this kind of crazy quilt. I have always been a law-abiding citizen. I have a permit to carry a gun in Colorado, but if I go south just 5 minutes into New Mexico, I have to comply with a different standard, and this bill would correct this different standard. 
Currently, a Federal standard governs the conduct of nonresidents in those States that do not have a right-to-carry statute. Many of us in this body have always strived to protect the interests of States and communities by allowing them to make important decisions on how their affairs should be conducted. We are taking to the floor almost every day to talk about mandating certain things to the States. This bill would allow States to decide for themselves. 
Specifically, it allows that the law of each State govern conduct within that State where the State has a right-to-carry statute, and States determine through a compact agreement which out-of-State right-to-carry statute will be recognized. 
To date, 31 States have passed legislation making it legal to carry concealed weapons. These State laws enable citizens of those States to exercise their right to protect themselves, their families, and their property. 
Applicants, of course, must be law-abiding citizens and pass their State's firearm training requirements. In my State of Colorado, the State legislature has passed a bill which puts into place statewide uniform standards for concealed weapons permits. 
The second major provision of this bill would allow qualified current and former law enforcement officers who are carrying appropriate written identification of that status to be exempt from State laws that prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons. This provision sets forth a checklist of stringent criteria that law enforcement officers must meet in order to qualify for this exemption status. Exempting qualified current and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons, I believe, would add additional forces to our law enforcement community in our unwavering fight against crime.

Mr. CAMPBELL. This appeared this morning, and is a story about seven people slain in violence in the last 36 hours in Washington, DC, four or more wounded in just that same 36-hour period. And I would point out that this is a city that has the tightest gun control laws in the Nation, so tight in fact that not a Senator or Congressman, not a Supreme Court Justice, for that matter, can carry a concealed weapon. It seems like only the bad guys can carry them in this town.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am privileged to honor my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. Today we salute Senator Thurmond, who becomes the Senate's longest serving Member. 
It only seems fitting that I should be allowed to speak in his honor today. Several years ago our roles were reversed, and the distinguished Senator was thanking me. Now I would like to return the honor and thank him for his years of leadership. When Senator Thurmond was jostled in the subway 2 years ago, I used my years of police training to come to his aid and help the police to handcuff his assailant. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The incident led to a friendship between the Senator and me that I very much enjoy. 
Now we are all here to recognize the achievements of Senator Thurmond and commend his years of dedicated leadership and service. The senior Senator from South Carolina has used his skill and knowledge to serve the Senate and provide direction for over 43 years. 
Senator Thurmond has provided strong leadership in this institution, both on the floor and in committee. He has drawn from his own personal knowledge from his decorated service in World War II to contribute to and lead the Armed Services Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. 
In 1942, Senator Thurmond joined the U.S. Army, and was among those brave young men of the 82d Airborne Division who landed in Normandy on D-day. For this service, he was awarded 5 Battle Stars. After earning 18 decorations for outstanding service in World War II, Senator Thurmond has maintained his dedication to war veterans throughout his years in the Senate. Senator Thurmond represents a wealth of institutional knowledge and history. 
Senator Thurmond's tenure has spanned a number of tumultuous decades, from the end of World War II, through the turmoil of the Vietnam war, to the end of the cold war, to this year, when the Congress finally agreed to a balanced budget. Through it all he provided the strong leadership which we are here to honor today. 
It gives me great pleasure to recognize our esteemed colleague as he becomes our longest serving U.S. Senator. Congratulations, Strom Thurmond, on making history as well as being a major part of our Nation's history. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to call my colleagues' attention to a historic event which occurred today in Statuary Hall, just down the hall from this chamber--the unveiling of Colorado's statue of Jack Swigert. I commend and applaud the efforts of all those Coloradans who helped to bring the Jack Swigert statue to Washington and Statuary Hall. 
The inclusion of this statue would not be possible without the efforts of many Coloradans, who I would like to thank for their tireless efforts. 
Among the individuals who worked on this project, the members of the Jack Swigert Memorial Commission should be mentioned for their dedication. Holly Coors, Marleen Fish, Don Friedman, Dennis Gallagher, Virginia Swigert, and Carl Williams all worked tirelessly under the chairmanship of Hal Shroyer. Has has spent 10 years on this project, and I am happy that he can see his goal achieved today. 
The Arapahoe County Republican Men's Club also stands out for its large contribution. Members lobbied the State legislature and donated substantial amounts of time and money in an effort to commission the statue. 
Of equal importance to the effort was Veterans of Foreign Wars Chapter 11229. It was commissioned soley for the purpose of persuading the State legislature to create the statue of Mr. Swigert and put the initiative on the ballot. Mr. Swigert was a lifelong member of VFW Post No. 1, which is the oldest VFW in the Nation founded after the Spanish-American War. 
Due to the dedicated efforts of these individuals and the many others involved in this project, Jack Swigert will be remembered and honored as a true American hero with this statue we dedicate to him today. And, his statue will represent Colorado with honor and distinction here in the U.S. Capitol for generations to come. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I would like to co-sponsor the Indian Tribal Government Unemployment Compensation Act Tax Relief Amendments of 1997 introduced by Senator McCain. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act of 1935 [FUTA] is a joint Federal-State tax system which imposes on each employer a tax on wages paid to their employees. These taxes are used to provide unemployment insurance to out-of-work citizens. The Federal portion of the tax can range up to 6.2 percent on wages paid, and the State portion ranges from near zero to 9 percent of wages paid. 
Indian tribes from around the country have contacted me expressing a great deal of confusion with the FUTA tax system and the difficulties they are having in planning as a result of the varying interpretations given FUTA by the IRS and the Labor Department. This problem is national in scope and experienced by tribes in the Great Lakes region such as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, and by tribes in my own State of Colorado--the Ute Mountain Ute and the Souther Ute tribes. 
The FUTA encourages States to undertake their own unemployment insurance programs by permitting employers to take the State unemployment insurance taxes they have paid and use them to offset their Federal unemployment insurance tax bill. 
This legislation is necessary to clarify the status of tribal governments under the FUTA and the Internal Revenue Code. As independent sovereign entities, Indian tribal governments should be afforded the same tax treatment, in this instance with regard to FUTA, as other governments--Federal, State, and local. Indian tribal governments are legitimate governments and, in fact, are one in four sovereign governments mentioned in the U.S. Constitution; the others being foreign nations, the several states, and the Federal Government. This is critical because FUTA treats private, commercial employers differently than it does foreign, State and local government employers. Private employers are subject to both State and Federal unemployment insurance taxes. 
In brief, the FUTA exempts foreign, Federal, State, and local government employers from the 0.8 percent Federal unemployment tax; and exempts foreign and Federal Government employers from the State unemployment insurance tax. FUTA allows state and local government employers to pay a favorable, lower State unemployment insurance taxes, and for tax purposes treats tax-exempt charitable organizations the same as State and local governments. 
The problem is that the FUTA does not expressly include Indian tribal government within the `government employer' category it has created for State and local government employers. As a result tribal governments across the country have been subjected to widely differing interpretations of the FUTA statute, with inconsistent results. Some tribes's good faith interpretation of the statute led them to believe that they, as units of government, were immune from the Federal tax. These tribes face large tax liabilities as a direct result of the way the act is being applied. Other tribes, again in good faith, did not participate in State unemployment insurance programs. In these instances, employees of tribal governments, both Indian and non-Indian, have been denied unemployment insurance benefits, pointing to the lack of participation by the tribes. 
Not surprisingly, the agencies charged with administering the tax and labor laws have not arrived at a consensus on the FUTA issue. For the past several years, various Internal Revenue Service field offices have interpreted the FUTA in different ways. The varying interpretations have resulted in differences in benefits availability for tribal employees, Indians as well as non-Indians, and differing degrees of tax liability for tribal governments themselves. The bottom line is that for Federal FUTA tax purposes, the treatment for tribes often depends on where they are located. Absent explicit recognition from Congress clarifying the status of tribal governments, this is a problem that will go on. 
Because State governments, the IRS, and the U.S. Labor Department cannot seem to agree on the status of Indian tribal governments under the FUTA, the time is right for the Congress to act and to clarify this issue so that tribal members can secure benefits they are entitled to and the tribes will have certainty and predictability in their employment and hiring decisions. 
Tribal government employers will benefit from this measure by the uniform application of the FUTA statute. The increased certainty that it will provide to tribal employers, their employees, and separated employees will enhance the tribal work environment, reduce litigation, and provide assurances to all parties involved. This bill would require that Indian tribal government employers receive the same treatment as Federal, State, and local governments and tax-exempt organizations receive for FUTA purposes. 
The Joint Tax Committee has been requested to estimate the revenue impact of this measure. Similar estimates performed in 1995 indicated the impacts to be minor. The development of tribal economies is a critical element in encouraging tribal self-sufficiency and political self-determination. Increasing the ability of tribal government employers to attract and retain the best skilled employees is one of my main objectives as chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. If the confusion and lack of certainty that has plagued tribal governments continues, employment with an Indian tribe will be increasingly unattractive, and tribes will suffer. 
By providing equitable FUTA treatment to tribal government employers, this legislation will assist in the long-term growth and stability of tribal economies and tribal governments. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this crucial measure.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Native American Financial Services Organization Act of 1996 [NAFSO]. This bill, based on a similar measure I introduced in the last Congress, seeks to provide new opportunity and hope for native American families by addressing the serious lack of private capital on Indian reservations. 
Having access to banking services is more than just a convenience. It means being able to get a loan to fix a leaky roof. It means getting the money to buy computers to start a small business. It means having enough money to send your son or daughter to college. It means buying your own home. 
Too often, these dreams never become a reality for Indian families. Many opportunities and services most of America takes for granted are not available in Indian country. Native Americans can't simply walk into a local bank to open a checking account or get a loan for a new house because for the most part, these institutions are nowhere near Indian reservations. 
NAFSO is not about new Government programs or bureaucracy. NAFSO is about supporting private banks that will not only provide basic services, but take the time to educate people, to bring them into the mainstream of financial services and give them a chance to build a home or start a business. 
NAFSO gives native Americans the same kind of access to banking services that other Americans enjoy. By eliminating provisions dealing with the secondary mortgage market, this version of NAFSO allows the organization to focus where the rubber meets the road. Working in conjunction with the community development financial institutions fund, NAFSO's primary role is to expand the availability of basic banking services through the creation and support of Native American Financial Institutions [NAFI's]. This provides the services that families need the most--checking accounts, mortgages, and other basic banking services. 
NAFSO will also play a crucial role in assisting NAFI's by providing them with much-needed technical assistance and developing specialized assistance to overcome barriers to lending on reservations. The organization will also work with the secondary market and other important financial mechanisms to identify barriers to private lending and make recommendations about how banks, Tribes, and government can do more to help this process. 
NAFSO does more than support new lending institutions or existing Indian-oriented banks and begins to address the historical barriers to private banking in Indian country. The trust status of reservation land and the inability to transfer title are serious concerns of bankers that need to be overcome and understood. Equally as challenging is the need to overcome stereotypes about Indian families and their social or economic condition. Often, banks decide Indians are not a good credit risk without ever having gone to the reservation. 
By providing information and interested in becoming more involved in Indian country, NAFSO can foster a new understanding of the real challenges we face. It can eliminate some of these misconceptions and myths and bring the private market and Indian communities together in ways never thought possible before. 
I had hoped that we would be assisted in this process by a report by the community development financial institutions fund at the Department of Treasury on Indian banking issues. Regrettably, work on that report, which was due almost 9 months ago, has not yet begun. Nevertheless, I feel that we should not delay our work. We need to concentrate now on finding real solutions to the economic, social and cultural challenges facing tribes and native American families. 
Mr. President, most people agree that Government cannot be the solution to all of this great Nation's problems. We can fix the Government programs, we can make them more efficient, but now we need to get the private sector involved in the challenges facing Indian country. The road to economic independence for all native American communities is a long one, but this bill is a big step in the right direction.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to call my colleagues' attention to an important issue facing the Western Slope of my home State of Colorado; namely, the lack of quality and reliable air service. 
I have long been concerned about this problem facing the residents and the business community in western Colorado. I have received hundreds of complaints from constituents up and down the Western Slope and have experienced many of these problems myself. For example, on numerous occasions I have found myself waiting for a delayed flight for several hours only to find out later on that the flight had been canceled. On one occasion, the pilot showed up only to announce that he was not certified to fly the plane. 
To address this issue, I held a field hearing on Wednesday, April 2, in Grand Junction, CO, to hear testimony firsthand from citizens and representatives of the business community. Witnesses at the hearing included representatives from the airlines industry, consumers as well as the business community. 
The testimony presented reflected the deep concern among business leaders and consumers in western Colorado about the lack of adequate air service. Many of the witnesses testified to the lack of competition in air service in western Colorado after deregulation. They further stressed that their concerns center around late arrivals, canceled flights, discontinuation of service, over booked flights, inadequate aircraft that cannot handle passenger baggage, inadequate safety procedures, inconvenient schedules and costs and high turnover of pilots. 
Because of the importance of this testimony, I wrote to the acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mr. Barry Valentine, on April 18, requesting the FAA's review of this material and requested a report from the FAA on ways in which air service can be improved on the Western Slope and how the witnesses' concerns can be addressed. I also provided a complete set of this testimony to the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, so it can be used in future subcommittee work on commuter air service.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators Inouye and Domenici, introduce legislation which will reform the existing Native American Pass-Through Program administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention [OJJDP], within the Department of Justice, and will create a grant program that will provide direct funding to eligible tribes for the purpose of addressing juvenile justice needs in Indian country. 
Juvenile delinquency is an enormous problem faced by both State and tribal governments. A February 1997 report, issued by OJJDP, indicated that law enforcement agencies around the country made an estimated 2.7 million arrests in 1995 of persons under age 18. This accounted for 18 percent of all arrests made during that year. OJJDP also reported that while the total number of juvenile arrests for violent crimes decreased in 1995, the total number of arrests is considerably higher than they were in 1992 and 67 percent higher than the 1986 level. 
Unfortunately, there are no complete and accurate sets of statistics available on the rate of juvenile delinquency among the American Indian and Alaskan Native population as a whole. In spite of this, I think it is fair and accurate to say that the threat of an increased rate of juvenile delinquency is great in Indian country due to the large and growing population of Indian youth under the age of 18. 
In fact, in a hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on April 8, a representative of the Department of Justice stated that `while violent crime is falling in American cities, it is rising on American Indian reservations.' Despite this, there are still about half as many police officers in Indian country on a per capita basis. 
Currently, tribal governments which perform law enforcement functions are eligible to receive grants through the Native American Pass-Through Program, established through the 1988 amendments to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974. Under this program, States must make available to tribes a minimum amount of funding based, in part, upon the ratio of the number of Indian juveniles within a State's boundaries compared to the total number of juveniles within that State. This funding may go toward a variety of juvenile delinquency prevention, control, or reduction efforts. 
Based upon the comments of representatives of tribal governments, State advisory groups, the National Coalition for Juvenile Justice, and State governments, it has become clear to me that the Pass-Through Program is simply not meeting the needs of tribes. First, the minimum amount of funding each State must make available to tribes is, on average, so minimal that it fails to appropriately address the needs of the tribes. While many States do award grants in excess of the requirement, the amounts tribes receive are often too small to initiate a program of any magnitude. In addition, many tribes do not even apply for these grants, because the cost of preparing a grant application would exceed the amount of funds awarded. More importantly, the Pass-Through Program exists in conflict with the Federal-tribal government-to-government relationship, by 
requiring tribal governments to depend upon the States. If a State chooses not to participate in the program or does not meet certain requirements, tribes located within that State's boundaries will not receive funds under the act. Because of these and other concerns raised by tribes and juvenile justice officials, I am introducing the Indian Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Improvement Act. This proposal seeks to eliminate the Native American Pass-Through Program and replace it with a discretionary grant program that will provide direct Federal grants to Indian tribes. Consistent with the Pass-Through Program, these funds will be used to plan and develop programs to prevent and reduce juvenile crime as well as to improve the tribal government's juvenile justice system. 
More specifically, this legislation will require tribes to submit program plans as part of their grant application to the Administrator of OJJDP. Tribes must comply with certain core requirements in order to demonstrate an ability to administer and account for the quality of the juvenile justice programs. Finally, this legislation includes a reporting requirement similar to the one mandated in the Indian Self-Determination Act. 
On the administrative side, the legislation directs OJJDP to take into account certain important factors when awarding grants such as a tribe's available resources and the population of Indian youth who reside within the tribe's jurisdiction. It is also important to note that this legislation in no way prevents tribes from entering into cooperative agreements with States or units of local government. Tribes are still able to enter into these agreements and apply for State funding should they desire to do so. 
The prevention, control, and reduction of juvenile delinquency should be one of the top priorities of this Nation. With this legislation, we have the opportunity to provide a better mechanism to deliver funds to tribes for the purpose of addressing juvenile justice needs, a much better mechanism than we currently have.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, with the approach of Memorial Day, we are reminded of the millions of American men and women who have dedicated and sacrificed their lives in service to the U.S. Armed Forces. And for far too many, it is a day to remember those service members who have yet to return home from the wars they valiantly fought many years ago. 
During the last Congress, we passed the Missing Service Personnel Act. Specifically, this bill created a framework of accountability within the Department of Defense to establish the status and location of our missing Armed Forces personnel. Until this legislation was introduced in 1995, the procedures for handling missing service personnel had remained unchanged for more than 50 years. This legislation improved procedures for reviewing POW/MIA cases and protected the missing service member from being declared dead solely based on the passage of time. Gathering 47 cosponsors in the Senate and achieving unanimous passage in the House, the bill became law in February 1996. However, an amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization Conference Report repealed its strongest provisions. 
Today, I am introducing The Missing Persons Authorities Improvement Act of 1997 in an effort to restore not only those lost provisions but to also offer a sense of accountability for our missing service personnel and their loved ones. A companion bill has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ben Gilman of New York. 
One major provision to be restored requires that military unit commanders report and initiate a search within 48 hours from the time a person has been deemed missing. Right now, a soldier can be missing for up to ten days before a report and search must be made. 
Another restored provision protects civilian defense employees and contractors who become missing as a result of hostile action. These civilians who serve with, or accompany the Armed Forces in the field under orders and place their lives in danger, should be entitled to the same protection that is given to uniformed soldiers. 
This bill also includes a provision which requires that if remains are recovered and are not identifiable through visual means, certification must be made by a forensic scientist that the remains recovered are, in fact, the missing person. In the past, hasty and speculative conclusions have often lead to misidentification and ultimately, undue emotional hardship for MIA families. It is our obligation to take full advantage of our current technological capabilities and provide the families of missing service personnel with certain, respectful closure in every case possible. 
As a veteran who served in Korea, I am especially proud to also include an additional provision that calls for the establishment of personnel files for Korean conflict cases. Under this provision, if any new information is discovered that indicates that the soldier may not have been killed during the Korean War, a new case must be opened or an existing one must be reviewed. There are currently some 8,000 of my Korean war colleagues who have never been accounted for. The recent efforts by the many families of Korean War MIA's to learn the fate of their loved ones only reinforce the necessity for this provision. These families deserve our respect and attention. 
This legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service organizations such as the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Korean and Cold War Families Association, and the National League of POW/MIA Families. 
This bill asks the Department of Defense only to make the best possible effort to recover and return our missing personnel. It is the least we owe our soldiers, past and present, who endanger their lives in defense of our country. It is the very least we owe the families who have and will endure the pain and uncertainty of a loved one left unaccounted for at a time of war.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair. We in the Chamber may agree or not agree with our colleague from Pennsylvania, but, frankly, I know of no one who would ever question his commitment to his beliefs or the ability to take on a tough, difficult, emotional issue such as we face today. It is an issue to which there probably is no universal right answer in the eyes of our fellow Americans. 
I know that many people have very strong opinions, sometimes driven by religion, by culture, by their own experiences, and perhaps I am no different than they are, but I do wish to commend the Senator from Pennsylvania for bringing this to the floor. 
I wish to speak for a few moments about this extremely emotional and difficult issue of partial-birth abortion. As the Senators from California know--they are not on the floor. I had hoped they would be. But as they know, I have defined myself over the years as pro-choice and have supported their efforts in protecting the rights of women in almost every debate in the last 10 years which I have known Senator Boxer and in the last 5 that I have known Senator Feinstein. In fact, I, like them, have had a 100 percent voting record for NARAL. 
Last year, I voted with them in opposition to the ban, this ban. I have always believed that all the laws in the world will not prevent a woman from aborting an unwanted fetus. Efforts to prevent it I think simply drive it underground. In fact, I saw that in graphic results years ago on a couple of occasions when I was a policeman in California prior to Roe versus Wade. 
Last year, before the override of the President's veto of the bill came about, I listened very carefully to those who hold very strong views on both sides of the issue. I think I learned a great deal from conversations with the medical community about this procedure and its implications. I am certainly not an expert, not a doctor, as is our previous speaker, but I think like most Americans I respect doctors and listen to their views very carefully when it deals with health. 
Certainly I will never suffer the tragic decision a woman has to make when she decides whether to terminate or not to terminate a pregnancy. But it did become clear to me that the procedure which would be banned is inflicted on a fetus so far along in its development that it is an infant, not a fetus, in the eyes of a layman like me. 
We are subject, of course, to very emotional debate, charts and graphs that are very explicit and tragic when we look at them, but we have to make a decision based on conscience, and last year I thought I did. When the vote, however, to override came about, I found myself confined to a hospital bed in the little town of Cortez, CO, as a result of an injury I sustained in a vehicle accident. I was there for a week. I watched C-Span, as so many Americans do. I had a chance to talk to the doctors who were involved in operating on me when I was in the hospital. And in watching the dedicated health professionals in that hospital working so hard day and night to save lives, as the days went by, it became increasingly clear to me that a vote to override the veto also represented an effort to save lives and not take lives. 
I had the opportunity to speak candidly to several of the doctors in that hospital as well as our doctor colleague here and a number of others about how this procedure is done and how often it is used. 
Mr. President, each of us has to make our own decisions based on our own frame of reference with our own conscience as our guide, and so it was with me last year. And although I was in the hospital, I did send a statement to be read into the Record by Senator Dan Coats, our colleague from Indiana, that I would have, had I been here at the time, changed my position and voted to override the President's veto. 
In recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a key witness on this issue, Dr. Ron Fitzsimmons, another physician whose opinion I respect, stated that this procedure is performed more often than he had originally testified, which supports what other doctors had told me. In light of this evidence and the evidence indicating that this procedure is only one among several options that women may elect to protect the life and health of the mother, this year I intend to support my colleague from Pennsylvania and support this ban. 
Now, I probably will not be alone among my colleagues in changing my view on this, and I am certainly aware that any time a Senator changes his mind, even if it is based on new evidence, he opens the door to all kinds of accusations of flip-flopping, being in someone's pockets, selling out, and all the other ludicrous charges that are immediately levied against him or her when he finds new evidence and does change his mind. I can live with that. What I cannot live with is not voting my conscience and will, therefore, vote in support of the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take the time today to commend an amazing young woman from my home State of Colorado. 
Linda Espinosa is a very special person. Not only has she been named the valedictorian of her school in Colorado Springs, but she is also one of only six people each year to be awarded the Junior Achievement Award by Amway Corp. This achievement is even more significant because the award is given to outstanding individuals who have excelled in a particular area, despite suffering from hardship or disability. Linda's triumph has been overcoming deafness to lead her class at the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind. 
I admire Linda's determination and scholarship, and ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing her accomplishment. I wish Linda the best of luck in her future endeavors. We can all learn a lesson in perseverance from this courageous young woman. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Colorado, Senator Wayne Allard, in supporting adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 25, which authorizes the placement of the statue of Jack Swigert in Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol. This important resolution was submitted by our colleague, Congressman Dan Schaefer, in the House of Representatives, who is the dean of our delegation. 
The inclusion of this statue would not be possible without the efforts of many Coloradans, who I would like to thank for their dedicated efforts. Among these groups, the Arapahoe County Republican Men's Club stands out for its large contribution. Club members lobbied the state legislature and donated substantial amounts of money in an effort to commission the statue. 
Also a key supporter of this effort was Veterans of Foreign Wars Chapter 11229. This chapter was commissioned solely for the purpose of persuading the state legislature to create the statue of Mr. Swigert and put the initiative on the ballot. Mr. Swigert was a lifelong member of VFW Post #1, which is the oldest VFW in the nation, founded after the Spanish-American War. 
Among the many individuals who worked on this honor, Mr. Hal Schroyer, who lives north of Denver, should be mentioned for 10 years of work on this project. 
Mr. Swigert was an extraordinary individual, even before his flight in the Apollo 13 spacecraft, made famous by the movie in 1996 that my colleague mentioned. 
Jack learned to fly at age 16, while attending Denver East High School, and was on the move ever since. Jack served in the Air Force in Korea, where he flew jet fighters. Even after his plane crashed into a radar unit on a Korean airstrip, Jack continued to fly. After leaving the service, he was a test pilot to 10 years. He kept busy, earning two master's degrees as a followup to his 1953 mechanical engineering degree. 
What Jack is best remembered for though, is his fateful aborted trip to the moon in 1970, as part of the Apollo 13 mission. Jack joined the crew at the last minute, after his colleague, Thomas Mattingly, was exposed to German Measles and could not make the trip. He had no idea just how exciting this trip would become when he started. After an oxygen tank exploded, the three-member crew used all their knowledge and ingenuity to bring the disabled ship home safely. Because of their quick thinking and grace under extreme pressure, all three members, Jack Haise, James Lovell and Jack Swigert returned safely to Earth. 
Following his service with NASA, Swigert put his extensive aeronautical expertise to use as the executive director of the House Committee on Science and Technology. He held the position until 1977, when he decided to run for the U.S. Senate. He was defeated by his friend William Armstrong in the primary and returned to private industry as the vice president for two prominent Denver companies. 
In 1982, Jack made a successful bid for a House seat, even after learning that he had cancer. Jack's courageous battle was an effort to prove that, to use his words, `technology and commitment can overcome any challenge.' Unfortunately, Jack did not win his battle with bone cancer, and, in December 1982, a month after winning the election, Jack passed away. 
Jack Swigert will be remembered and honored with this statue we dedicate to him as a true American hero. And, his statue will represent Colorado with honor and distinction here in the U.S. Capitol for years to come. To my knowledge, this will be the first space age statue to be included. With my colleague from Colorado, I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important resolution. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I reintroduce legislation to transfer the Collbran project from the Federal Government back to the people it serves. The bill is designed with only one goal in mind, to guarantee the growing population in the Grand Valley of Colorado a supply of water that they have relied on for the last 30 years. 
At the same time, this legislation will be a model for transitioning the Federal Government out of the daily operations of facilities where its useful participation has ceased. This transfer will also be an important and symbolic step in downsizing the Federal Government, returning power to the States and localities, while contributing to our continuing efforts to balance the Federal budget. 
The Western slope of Colorado, like the rest of the Colorado Plateau, has a unique blend of rich natural resources and beautiful scenery. This fortunate combination attracts and sustains a strong economy of both industry and tourism. Much of this booming economic development and recreational opportunities would not exist if not for the water and electricity provided by the various Federal reclamation projects in the West. These projects were authorized in the Federal Reclamation Act in 1902 by a visionary Congress which saw the need and importance of water projects to the development of the West. Without such projects, there would be virtually no farming, mining, or ranching and little tourism. 
It is appropriate for the Federal Government to shed the Collbran project at this time because the goals of the project have been met. The project, completed in 1964, provides a reliable supply of irrigation water to the users on the arid west slope of Colorado. This project is the main water supplier for a growing population in the Grand Valley, currently serving over 55,000 people. It also provides electric power to the grid that serves several Western States. 
It is also time now to transfer the Collbran project because, as the Bureau of Reclamation has acknowledged, due to unanticipated circumstances this project has been a net-cash drain on the Treasury. The Ute Water Conservancy District, the public entity that will purchase the project, will pay the remaining debt on the project, reimbursing the Government completely, returning over $12 million to the Federal Treasury. It is time for the Government to stand aside. 
Let me stress that this transfer will not in any way jeopardize any of the recreation opportunities available in Vega Reservoir and related Collbran project reservoirs. In fact, this legislation will transfer the Vega Reservoir from the Federal Government to the State of Colorado, ensuring continued recreation opportunities there. This bill also preserves all water and power operations of the existing Collbran project. 
I also want to emphasize that we have striven to accommodate environmental groups' concerns. Although there is no reason to think that a mere transfer of ownership, without affecting the operations, should require the water district to perform an environmental impact statement under the National Environmental Policy Act, I have accommodated the environmental community's requests and eliminated any reference to NEPA. In this way, I have ensured that the transfer will fully comply with all environmental laws. 
Finally, as a symbol of the Ute Water Conservancy's good faith, this bill explicitly requires that the conservancy district contributes $600,000 to the Colorado River Endangered Fish Recovery Program and that the project itself will remain subject to future ESA-related obligations that could be imposed on similar projects. 
Again, the object of this legislation is merely to ensure a reliable supply of quality water for the residents of the Grand Valley who have depended upon this supply for the last 30 years. This bill proposes a fiscally and environmentally sound and sensible transfer of an existing Federal project to the people it serves. 
I look forward to working with all interested parties as this bill proceeds. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this bill.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which would provide for a 1-year extension of the work opportunity tax credit, authorizing the credit beyond this fiscal year through the end of fiscal year 1998. 
My colleagues know well the history behind the work opportunity tax credit. It is the successor to the targeted jobs tax credit which expired 2 years ago and which received some criticism that it was an ineffective incentive mechanism. However, Congress felt that there could be some type of worthwhile incentive which could encourage employers to hire individuals from economically disadvantaged groups, and as a result, the credit was revised, renamed the work opportunity tax credit, and incorporated into the Small Business Job Protection Act (P.L. 104-188), which the Congress passed and the President signed into law last year. 
The revised tax credit, with tougher standards, such as in the area of certification and retention requirements, was authorized for 1 fiscal year and is set to expire on September 30, 1997. The legislation I am introducing today would simply provide for an extension of the work opportunity tax credit for 1 additional fiscal year, through September 30, 1998. 
There are several reasons for the extension. First, employers now have a tax incentive to hire individuals from targeted economically disadvantaged groups, providing these individuals with jobs and valuable work experience. In the wake of the historic welfare reform legislation which was signed into law last year, I believe this incentive to put people to work is a vital one, and it should be given the opportunity to work. 
Second, Congress authorized this credit for 1 year to allow the Department of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and the Congress to study the costs and benefits of the credit. To date, there are no statistics available. And while we await a more complete set of statistics on how the revised tax credit is performing, I believe the Congress should begin consideration of an extension of this credit to allow more employers to take part in the program and to provide an assurance to employers and potential employees alike that there is an incentive which is available to stimulate job opportunities. The sooner we are able to provide an extension for the credit, the more secure both the employers and the employees who take part in this credit will be. 
In addition, authorizing the credit for an additional fiscal year will provide this Congress with a set of statistics available from multiple fiscal years, not just 1, allowing us to better assess the costs and benefits of the WOTC. 
I am hopeful that the revised tax credit will prove more successful than its predecessor. I have long been a supporter and advocate for the promotion of job opportunities and job training for at-risk youth and ex-offenders, in particular. Any incentive to put more Americans to work should be given the chance to succeed; 1 year is simply not enough. 
With that, I ask this bill be referred to the appropriate committee. During the 105th Congress, a number of tax proposals will be under consideration, and it is my hope that, by introducing this measure, the work opportunity tax credit does not get lost in the shuffle and expire prematurely.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate to recognize the historic importance of the Denver summit of eight, and the contributions made by my home State of Colorado and many Coloradans in hosting this historic summit. 
This meeting marks a historic change in the G-7 summit. For the first time in the 23-year history of these economic summits, Russia has been asked to participate to an unprecedented degree. At the Denver summit of eight, Russia will participate as a member, rather than as a passive observer who in the past were only allowed to engage in a post-summit dialog with the G-7. 
In this important substantive and symbolic step, President Yeltsin will join with the leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations of Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, and the United States to discuss monetary and economic policy. 
After this significant development was announced at the recent United States-Russia summit, the name of the meeting was changed from G-7 to the Denver summit of eight. 
As Coloradans, we are proud to have such a distinguished group of leaders coming to our State. And, as an honorary chairman, along with Senator Allard and Congresswoman DeGette, I am proud that Colorado was chosen to host this historically important meeting. 
The Denver area is symbolically important for being centrally located between our European partners to the east, our Japanese partner to the west, and the Canadian partner to the north. Furthermore, the thriving industries in Colorado and the robust economy of the Denver area reflect the growing economic importance of Colorado in the international arena. 
The Denver area is a recognized leader in aerospace, telecommunications, biotechnology, high technology, health care, education, recreation, and tourism. We are proud to share these achievements with the rest of the global community. 
I would also like to commend those dedicated Coloradans who serve as law enforcement officials, emergency medical technicians, firefighters, and health care providers, as well as the countless volunteers, who will provide invaluable services and contributions in support of the summit. Given the importance of this meeting, they have been working hard on their preparations to help ensure that the summit will proceed smoothly. This summit would not be possible without their donations of time, hospitality, and commitment. 
I urge my colleagues to support passage of this resolution.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce five pieces of legislation affecting Federal lands in my home State of Colorado. 
The purpose of these bills is to facilitate the process of consolidating our Federal lands into contiguous blocks which makes their management more efficient and less costly. 
Much of the land over which the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service has management authority contains numerous inholdings which may have been old mining claims or other privately owned parcels. This patchwork ownership often creates management problems. For example, a particular parcel may block the public's access to other Federal lands. The presence of an inholding may limit the tools which can be used by the Federal agency to manage the land. If a controlled fire is needed to clear underbrush or stop the spread of insects, the presence of private land in the midst of the area may well preclude the use of fire as a management tool. All these considerations require much more time, and adds to the expense of caring for Federal lands. 
Whenever an owner of these private parcels willingly offers to sell or exchange their lands, it is important that the Federal Government is able to accomplish these transactions to increase management efficiency and public use. The designated Federal agencies have reviewed these bills and the legislation reflects their input. 
The first bill, the Larson and Friends Creek exchange, directs the Secretary of the Interior to exchange lands of equal value for several small parcels within the Handies Peak Wilderness Study Area and Red Cloud Peak Wilderness Study Area in Hinsdale County, CO. This exchange will allow the study areas to better fit the definition of a wilderness area. 
The second bill, the Slate Creek addition to Eagles Nest Wilderness, provides for the expansion of the wilderness area in Summit County, CO. The 
current owners of this parcel are willing to convey it to the United States only if it is added to the existing wilderness area and permanently managed as wilderness. This addition will increase public access to the wilderness. 
The third bill, Raggeds Wilderness boundary adjustment, is necessary to correct the effects of earlier erroneous land surveys. Certain landowners in Gunnison County, CO, who own property adjacent to the Raggeds Wilderness have occupied or improved their property in good faith based upon a survey they reasonably believed to be accurate. This bill is necessary to accomplish an adjustment of the boundary between the private landowners and the wilderness area. The entire area involved in this adjustment is less than 1 acre. 
The fourth bill, Miles land exchange, authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to convey lands of equal value in exchange for the Miles parcel located adjacent to the Routt National Forest in Routt County, CO. The purpose of this exchange is to improve on-the-ground management of public lands which are now isolated and difficult to manage. It will eliminate the need for long standing special use permits and add riparian acres to the national forest. 
The final bill, the Dillon Ranger District transfer, allows for a boundary adjustment to transfer the Dillon Ranger District from the Arapaho National Forest to the White River National Forest. The Dillon District is already under the jurisdictional management of the White River National Forest. However, this technical correction is necessary because any official publications of the U.S. Forest Service references the district as a part of the Arapaho National Forest and confuses the public.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 522, legislation which would allow civil and criminal penalties to be imposed for the unauthorized access of tax returns and return information by employees of the Internal Revenue Service or other Federal employees. It is altogether appropriate that this issue should come before both the House and Senate on April 15, and I applaud the efforts of my colleagues, Senators Coverdell and Glenn, to work together on this bipartisan piece of legislation. 
Abuse by employees of the IRS has been of concern to Members of Congress for many years. Over the years numerous Coloradans have written me to express their concerns with this type of abuse as well. And with the recent release of the report by the General Accounting Office detailing its findings on security problems at the IRS, in addition to reports on browsing by IRS employees through private taxpayer files, this issue has once again come to the forefront. 
This morning, as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, I held a hearing to receive testimony on the issue of browsing. For the record, I would like to state the witnesses included: Senator John Glenn; Larry Summers, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury; Dr. Rona B. Stillman, Chief Scientist for Computers and Telecommunications with the GAO; Margaret Milner Richardson, Commissioner of the IRS; and Valerie Lau, inspector general of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. 
It became clear in all of the witnesses' testimonies this morning that currently it is not necessarily illegal for IRS employees to browse through taxpayer files. The law, as it exists, makes it difficult for the IRS to take effective action against those employees who are caught browsing taxpayer files. 
Those IRS employees who do access the computerized or paper records of celebrities, friends, or enemies most often do so just for the fun of it. However, let me tell you--taxpayers do not find this activity very funny. It is an invasion of privacy, and unauthorized browsing should be punishable with civil and criminal penalties. During this morning's hearing, Treasury officials kept referring to taxpayers as `customers'. Well, I would like to clarify that in my State Coloradans do not consider themselves customers. If anything, they consider themselves victims. Unfortunately, taxpayers have become victims of browsing, and they currently have no assurances that browsers will be held accountable for their actions.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, today I join Senator McCain in introducing the Indian Child Welfare Act Amendments of 1997. This legislation will amend the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA] and will serve the best interests of Indian children across the United States in the process. The ICWA is a procedural statute and this legislation clarifies and strengthens the procedures contained in it. The bill strengthens the statute by providing certainty, stability, and finality to adoptions and other placements involving Indian children. 
In the 104th Congress, this legislation received the support of parties affected by and knowledgeable of ICWA-related adoptions: tribal organizations, and non-Indian adoption attorneys. The bill I am cosponsoring today addresses the major concerns of these parties in a way that strengthens the existing ICWA, and provides certainty and finality to non-Indian adoptive families. Most important, this bill serves the best interests of Indian children and enhances the integrity of Indian families. 
Adoption and child custody proceedings are delicate and emotional matters for all involved: for the Indian child; for the birth parents; for the Indian tribe; and for the adoptive parents. My own experience as a youth is helpful in providing a context for ICWA and why it was enacted. I grew up in California, many miles from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana where my tribe and relatives lived. I am lucky in that even though I was not raised on the reservation, I still cling to my tribal identity, my culture, and the spiritual traditions that make me a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. Many Indian youth are not so lucky, and once removed from their Indian families, tribes and cultures, never regain what they have lost. 
The 1978 statute has worked well since its inception, and the reasons it was introduced are crucial to understanding the act and the legislation we introduce today. After exhaustive congressional testimony and many years of hard work the Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted in 1978. Prior to 1978 there were no available protections for Indian children, families, or tribes in situations involving the unwarranted and forced removal of Indian children from their families, tribes, and rich cultures. The cold fact is that prior to ICWA between 25 percent and 35 percent of all Indian children were separated from their families and given to adoptive families or placed in foster care or in institutions. 
Through exhaustive hearings prior to enactment of the 1978 act, the Congress realized that at the staggering rate of Indian child removal, it would have been simply a matter of time before Indian families and tribes would literally be sapped of their futures--their precious children. 
The ICWA is procedural in nature and is designed to protect the best interests of 
Indian children by reinforcing the strong interests Indian families and tribes have in maintaining their relationships with their children. The act also recognizes that tribal authorities and tribal courts are the appropriate authorities over Indian adoptions and placements. Just as we in the majority often speak of maintaining families and traditions and of respecting the rights of local governments, this act is one of the few Indian statutes that actually does both. 
Non-Indian institutions, including State courts, do not and cannot completely understand the unique culture and relationships that make up tribal life. Because they cannot know these facts and these relationships, they should not be given authority to make child custody decisions involving Indian children. Practically, State authorities are not in a position to make these decisions. Legally, they should not be allowed to make these decisions. The right of any sovereign nation, including Indian nations, includes the right to determine who is and who is not a member or citizen. The legislation we introduce today preserves those most basic rights of Indian tribes: tribal self-preservation and self-determination. 
Mr. President, I want to say a word about adoptive parents and families. The decision to adopt a child or children is one that is done out of the noblest motives, and with much love and affection. It is often a process fraught with many obstacles, both emotional and financial. I have nothing but the greatest respect and admiration for adoptive parents. This legislation will provide adoptive parents with the security they sometimes lack under current law. The bill will provide what many have complained of: finality and security in cases involving Indian children. For the past several years, there have been highly publicized cases involving Indian children and what some felt were late interventions by tribes in these proceedings. 
By strengthening the procedures of ICWA this bill will make cases like the ones we saw last year a thing of the past. Parties seeking placement of Indian children would be required to file detailed notices with the tribe that includes biographical information on the child, as well as information regarding the rights of the tribe in responding to the notice. With the notice in hand, the tribe must decide if it wants to intervene or not, and to inform the party seeking placement of its intentions. 
By requiring tribes to file written notice of intervention and providing time limits within which tribes can intervene in proceedings, adoptive parents can be assured that they will not face the prospect of having final or near final. These procedural demands are not unduly burdensome and fall equally on both the parties seeking placement and tribal governments. 
The truth is that many of these inflammatory and well-publicized cases involved unethical attorneys and other adoption professionals who advised their Indian clients to conceal or not reveal their Indian heritage in an effort to expedite the adoption. Because 
ICWA-related adoptions and proceedings involve procedural requirements, some attorneys and professionals seek to cut corners and save time and money. Not only is this shortsighted, but is damaging to all parties involved in an adoption or custody proceeding. 
By expediting these adoptions, the attorneys interests were served. But what about the Indian children, Indian families, Indian tribes, and non-Indian adoptive families? 
As we have seen, these people have had to endure long, bitter, and costly court battles some of which continue to this day. The legislation we introduce today will provide tough civil and criminal penalties to any person that willfully falsifies facts regarding whether a child is Indian or whether a parent is Indian; makes false or fraudulent statements; or falsifies documents containing facts related to the proceeding. 
These provisions are not radical notions. They simply provide that if you are involved in an ICWA-related proceeding, and if you do not want to lose your money and your freedom, follow the law. No good adoption attorney worth his salt will fear these penalties if he or she follows the law and is forthright with the facts. 
I urge my colleagues to join in enacting this crucial legislation to bring stability and certainty to adoptions and other proceedings involving Indian children.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I express my concern for the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. I first want to reiterate my firm belief that a permanent geological repository represents the most responsible solution for the ultimate disposition of spent commercial nuclear reactor fuel. 
Presently, this radioactive material sits in temporary storage at 70 or so sites around the country, including my State, Colorado. Colorado also has several tons of the much deadlier plutonium haunting Rocky Flats, less 20 miles from Denver. So, I am no stranger to nuclear material, the related hazards and costs. Nor is my view different from that of any other Coloradan, or citizen of any other State--I want safe, efficient, responsible solutions to the questions presented by nuclear technology. 
But S. 104 does not present a safe, responsible solution to the question of commercial spent fuel and I cannot vote for it. First, S. 104 would make Denver the crossroads of radioactive material on an almost daily basis for the next 30 years. S. 104 will send much of the spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste from eastern States traveling west through Denver on I-70, while trans-uranic waste from Idaho will travel south through Denver on I-25 to New Mexico. 
Therefore, my first point of concern is that Colorado would bear the brunt of the risks of truck and train accidents and the risks of radioactive releases almost every day, for the next 30 years. This gives me great pause. Only with the utmost confidence in the transportation details--the routing plans, the casks housing the spent fuel assemblies, the emergency response preparedness--would I feel comfortable subjecting the residents of Colorado to this great burden. I do not have that confidence yet. In fact, for example, the Colorado Highway Patrol has indicated that I-70 west of Denver is simply not suitable for the safe transportation of radioactive materials. Federal preemption through S. 104, however, threatens to override the CHP's designation and force the use of the I-70 corridor anyway. 
I do not mean to suggest that this is my only concern with S. 104, or that this concern in and of itself would be sufficient to cause my opposition. If the bulk of S. 104 represented a sound, responsible solution to an urgent national problem, then my analysis would be quite different. S. 104 is not such a bill, however. 
Although no one can deny the growing problem of spent nuclear fuel throughout our country, the problem is currently not one of safety, but one of cost. It costs the utilities and, therefore, the ratepayers a lot of money to store this material in temporary facilities. Again, Colorado is not immune. Many Colorado ratepayers contributed to the nuclear waste fund, which was established to finance the permanent disposal of this material, and must pay to maintain storage. But, by all accounts, safety is not an urgent issue for temporary, onsite storage in Colorado or any other State. Were safety an urgent 
consideration at this point, again, my analysis would be quite different. 
What concerns me most, however, is the chronology of disposal in S. 104. This bill requires that the Energy Department construct an interim storage site 100 miles north of Las Vegas, NV, and begin accepting spent fuel and high-level nuclear waste well before the permanent repository at nearby Yucca Mountain, NV, is licensed, or even found suitable for permanent disposal. 
Consequently, there is the very real danger that, even if the permanent site is for some reason deemed unsuitable for disposal of the spent fuel, it will be used anyway simply because the waste would already be nearby at the interim site. Worst yet, there is the danger that the material would remain at the interim site indefinitely. Finally, there is the haunting specter that if Yucca Mountain is not found suitable as a permanent repository, all the spent fuel then stored at the interim site would have to be shipped back across the country--through Colorado again--to some other site. 
I am sympathetic to the pressures bearing on the nuclear utilities and the ratepayers who have paid once already to have this material disposed of and who must pay again to store this waste while Yucca Mountain is prepared. I also understand that the Energy Department is contractually obligated to begin removing the spent fuel from the States by 1998. 
But, the safe, responsible disposition of material that will remain deadly for many tens of thousands of years is simply not like buying a car. If it takes some years longer than anticipated, if it costs more money than we thought at first, so be it. In finding a safe place in which to keep this material for a time longer in duration than all of recorded human history, 5, 10, even 20 additional years should not deter us. In the context of radioactive waste, truly, I would rather be safe, than sorry. These words point the way to a better approach to a daunting national problem. S. 104 does not.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to begin my statement today describing a powerful and emotional sight that moves us to the core of our faith and beliefs about America and about those who served in the Armed Forces of our Nation. 
Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that train our future military leaders. These academies have varied missions and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing leaders for their particular service. On the grounds of each academy is a chapel, a spectacular place that at once identifies itself as a place of worship. 
In each chapel, a place has been reserved for the prisoners of war and the missing in action from their particular service. A pew has been set aside and marked by a candle, a powerful symbol that not all have returned from battle. This hallowed place has been set aside so that all POW's and MIA's are remembered with dignity and honor. It is a moving and emotional moment to pause at this reserved pew, to be encouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of those soldiers, sailors, and pilots and to be inspired today by what they have done. 
We can do more to honor the memory of the POW's and MIA's who have served in our Nation's wars. 
Therefore, today I am introducing the National POW/MIA Recognition Act of 1997. This act would authorize the POW/MIA flag to be displayed over military installations, post offices, and memorials around the Nation and other appropriate places of significance on Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, National POW/MIA Recognition Day, and on the last business day before each of the preceding holidays. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Jane Harman from California. 
Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families POW/MIA flag. Displaying this flag would be a powerful symbol to all Americans that we have not forgotten--and will not forget. 
As you know, the United States has fought in many wars, and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by the enemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th century wars alone, more than 147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners of war; of that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to the number those who are still missing in action, we realize that more can be done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country. 
The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but also for their families who personally carry with them the burden on sacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they remember the loyalty and devotion of those who served. 
As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the remembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and most noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and gratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom. 
Just as those special reserved pews in the chapels of the military academies recall the spirit and presence of our POW's and MIA's, so too will the display of their flag over military installations and other Government offices be a special reminder that we have not forgotten--and will not forget. Before this coming Memorial Day I invite my Senate colleagues to please join me in passing this bill to display the POW/MIA flag on national days of celebration.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this month both Houses of Congress have been engaged in a difficult debate over whether to uphold or overturn the President's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States to fight drug trafficking. 
This debate has had a growing negative impact on U.S. relations with an important country and trading partner along our southern border. The debate also has shown how the certification process under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is not as effective as Congress originally intended it to be. 
Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too late and not specific enough to fix the problems. Moreover, access to more timely and specific information would assist Congress in exercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities. 
Therefore, on Tuesday of this week, I introduced S. 457, a bill to provide a new option to the President to place countries such as Mexico on a probationary status of 7 months, during the period of March 1 through September 30. If by the end of this probationary period, the target country complies with the specific conditions stipulated by the President, full certification would be granted. However, if these conditions are not met, the United States would act firmly by cutting off aid beginning on October 1 of this year. 
I am pleased that the compromise the Senate is considering today reflects to some extent the main components of my bill. The pending resolution recognizes that Mexico has taken insufficient steps to stop drug trafficking and it stipulates a 6-month period of time in which the President will review Mexico's progress in this area. The resolution also requires the President to submit a report to Congress by September 1 on Mexico's progress. 
However, the resolution we consider today does not nearly go far enough. Its findings regarding Mexico are not specific; it does not provide specific steps Mexico must take to continue receiving aid; and it does not amend the existing law to improve the certification process in the future, as my bill does. 
I am voting in favor of the pending resolution today because it is the only legislation the Senate will consider this week to address the certification of Mexico. Nevertheless, I urge my colleagues to support S. 457 to improve the certification process for the future. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, this month Congress has been considering the important issue of whether to uphold or overturn the President's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States to fight drug trafficking. I am concerned that without congressional action, the Senate must choose between two less than ideal options: First, to support the President's certification of Mexico and continue business as usual, thereby downplaying serious deficiencies in Mexico's efforts; or second, to decertify Mexico, with or without a waiver, which might destabilize an important country along our southern border. 
Under current law, notice provided to the target country is often too late and not specific enough to fix the problems. Moreover, access to more timely and specific information would assist Congress in exercising its legislative and oversight responsibilities. 
Therefore, today I propose a bill to provide an alternative approach. This legislation would provide the administration a new option to certify countries such as Mexico on probationary status for 7 months, which extends from March 1 through September 30, the end of the fiscal year. However, during this time period, the country on probationary certification is expected to comply with certain conditions stipulated by the President. If these conditions are not met at the end of this 7-month period, the United States will act firmly, such as by cutting off aid. 
This alternative would put countries on notice that the United States has serious concerns about their lack of cooperation. But, it would provide a fair period of time during which those countries could address U.S. concerns. 
This constructive notice period would be less disruptive to our bilateral relations. We saw last week some of the damage which could occur in our relationship with Mexico after the House voted to decertify Mexico within 90 days if certain criteria are not met. News reports quoted Mexico's President, Ernesto Zedillo, as stating: `This is where we draw the line. Our sovereignty and dignity as a nation are not negotiable.' 
My bill also provides better notice to Congress. Under this alternative, Congress would be informed about those specific concerns which the President identified regarding a country's lack of cooperation. Congress also would be able to track that country's progress during the 7-month probationary period and, of course, maintain its prerogative to pass legislation as it deems necessary. I believe this would help avoid the contentious battle in which the Congress and the administration currently are engaged this month over Mexico. 
It is no surprise that many Senators feel strongly about decertifying Mexico. Reports indicate that as much as 70 percent of the cocaine entering the United States comes through Mexico; up to 30 percent of the heroin used in the United States comes through Mexico; and 80 percent of imported 
marijuana comes through Mexico. 
Recent developments in that country have exacerbated what is already a serious flow of illegal drugs into the United States. For example, according to a news report in the March 2 San Diego Union Tribune, Mexican authorities are now preventing our DEA agents and law enforcement officers from carrying their weapons into Mexico. In response, the DEA reportedly pulled its agents out of cross-training and intelligence-gathering projects in Mexico along the border. Agents and officers now fear they will become targets for gangs and drug traffickers, especially if Mexico's certification is revoked. This is intolerable. 
Further motivating the push to decertify Mexico is the recent arrest of Mexico's drug czar, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, on allegations he was being paid to protect one of Mexico's top drug lords. The general is reported to have extensive drug ties, dating back to at least 1993, at the same time he was supposed to be fighting drug use and trade in his country. 
Any information that the general may have possessed has been compromised. Nor is he alone in being corrupt. According to a Los Angeles Times report on March 3, court documents from two drug gang assassins indicate that approximately 90 percent of the law enforcement officers in Tijuana and the State of Baja California in Mexico are corrupt. 
These developments raise serious concerns among DEA agents, who cannot adequately do their job if they do not receive the help of their Mexican counterparts. During his testimony before the House Subcommittee on National Security on February 27, 1997, Thomas Constantine, the Administrator of the DEA, called fighting drug trafficking without assistance from other countries nearly impossible. 
In light of these disturbing developments, I wrote to the President last Friday expressing my concern with his certification of Mexico. I also urged the administration to take all necessary steps to ensure Mexico does its fair share in controlling the flow of illicit drugs across its border into the United States. 
Decertifying Mexico will not make this process any easier. Yet, we cannot risk the implication that we condone Mexico's failed drug policy by fully certifying Mexico without certain conditions. Certification of Mexico in light of the compelling facts of that country's involvement in drug trafficking also makes a mockery of the certification provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act. 
In light of these facts, I am concerned that the President has certified Mexico as fully cooperating with the United States. However, I am also concerned that decertifying Mexico could destabilize a country important to us and cause a potential crisis on our southern border. Unfortunately, that is the choice the administration has under existing law. 
Therefore, the bill I introduce today would amend the existing law to avoid this type of problem in the future. The current certification process is set forth in section 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. It requires the President to submit to Congress by March 1 of each year a list of major illicit drug producing and transiting countries which he certifies are fully cooperating with the United States. This bill offers a good middleground--I urge support. 
Under existing law, the President has three options: One, certify a country which has cooperated fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts or has taken adequate steps on its own to comply with the 1988 U.N. anti- 
drug trafficking convention. Two, decertify a country for not fully cooperating. Or three, decertify a country but provide a waiver because it is in the national interests of the United States to continue to provide aid. 
Under this law, when a country is decertified, at least 50 percent of U.S. bilateral foreign aid is suspended in the current fiscal year. In fact, that county may lose more than 50 percent of its current funding if the State Department has not yet released the aid. Unless the country is recertified, all U.S. aid is suspended in subsequent fiscal years. And, the United States is required to vote against loans in the multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. 
Congress has 30 days from receipt of the President's certification to enact a joint resolution disapproving the President's action. If Congress passes such a resolution, the President can veto it and require a two-thirds majority vote in Congress to override the veto. 
Congress also has its prerogative to pass a resolution with other timeframes, which would be subject to a Presidential veto. We saw this last week when the House passed a resolution to decertify Mexico within 90 days if certain criteria are not met. 
On February 28, 1997, the President submitted his annual list to Congress. This report indicated that 23 countries, including Mexico, are certified as fully cooperating; three countries were determined not to be fully cooperating, but were deemed in the national interest--Belize, Lebanon, and Pakistan--and six countries were decertified (Afghanistan, Burma, Colombia, Iran, Nigeria, and Syria. 
The impact of this process on Mexico could be dramatic. If Congress were to pass a resolution of disapproval within the 30-day review period and the President does not exercise his waiver authority, the impact would include: Suspension of at least 50 percent of United States assistance for the current fiscal year; total suspension of aid in the next fiscal year, unless Mexico were recertified; and the United State would vote against loans to Mexico in the multilateral development banks. Mexico receives $17 million in bilateral aid from the United States and, according to the Export-Import Bank, 56 applications from Mexico could be affected which total $3.24 billion. 
The alternative that I am proposing today provides a middle ground because it revisits the certification issue more often during the course of the year. The President also is given more flexibility in labelling countries more accurately. 
I'm also concerned that under existing law, we are giving a free ride to countries which are decertified but then are granted a waiver and continue to receive aid because it is deemed in the national interest of the United States. These waivers, in essence, allow the provision of aid year after year to countries not fully cooperating with the United States. What incentive do these countries have to improve their cooperation? 
My legislation builds on the existing carrot and stick approach in the certification process. This type of approach has been successful with other problems in the past, and I think it would go a long way to avoid similar controversies in the future like the one we have seen surrounding the Mexico certification this month. 
Under my bill, the carrot is certification, although for a finite period of time of 7 months. During this probationary period, all U.S. aid continues to flow and the United States remains supportive in international development banks. The President also stipulates which specific conditions must be met by that country to improve its cooperation with the United States and to continue receiving U.S. aid. Not only is sufficient notice provided to the country, but to the Congress as well. 
The stick is a penalty similar to that under existing law. If after 7 months the country does not comply with the stipulations made by the President to improve its cooperation with the United States, 100 percent of U.S. bilateral aid is cut off. The United States also would vote against aid in the multilateral development banks if the country does not comply with U.S. stipulations, as provided for under current law. These penalties would remain in effect until the President notifies Congress that the country has complied with the stipulations made in the President's original probationary certification. 
In my opinion, this alternative approach would force fuller compliance by countries and, in future cases similar to Mexico, help avoid a potential crisis in those countries. 
We need to send a very strong message to our neighbors in Mexico and similarly situated countries when we do not believe that they are fully cooperating with United States efforts to combat drug trafficking. But, to risk a crisis along our own border is asking for greater trouble. 
I believe that a compromise solution, as outlined in my proposal, is the most reasonable way to address similar circumstances in the future, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to extend the authorization for certain programs under the Native American Programs Act of 1974. This bill is critical to continue the availability of a modest amount of grant funds used by native communities nationwide to foster economic growth, develop tools for good governance methods, and promote social welfare. 
The authorization for most of these programs has expired and though the administration has requested funding for fiscal year 1998 at fiscal year 1997 levels, it has not introduced legislation to reauthorize the act. The legislation I am introducing today would do just that. 
These programs are administered through the Administration for Native Americans [ANA] located within the Department of Health and Human Services. By awarding annual grants on a competitive basis, the Native American Programs Act promotes self-sufficiency and self-determination by encouraging tribes, villages, and other native communities to develop and plan local strategies in economic and social development. The program is designed to build greater capacity at the tribal level for better governance, more vibrant and diversified economies, and social development. 
The ANA Program has proven successful for native communities since its inception and has generated widespread support by America's native communities. The centerpiece of the program are grants made under the Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) Program; grants to tribes enhance tribal environmental regulatory capabilities; and grants made to preserve and rehabilitate native languages. 
This legislation will simply extend for 4 years until fiscal year 2000 the authorization for these modestly funded yet very successful programs to strengthen and rebuild tribal communities around the United States.

 Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I am pleased to join Senator Domenici and Vice Chairman Inouye in introducing the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997, to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. [ISTEA]. 
More than any other communities in the United States, Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages suffer from a lack of adequate infrastructure, and the necessary tools to build and maintain that infrastructure. The United States has a special responsibility to Indian tribal governments to help them achieve economic self-sufficiency and political self-determination. 
Economies today, whether State, tribal, or national, are increasingly dependent on interstate and international commerce for their livelihoods. Solid physical infrastructure is the foundation for those economies. 
Federal ISTEA funding to tribal governments has lagged behind spending for States and local governments over the years, despite acute and unmet needs in Indian country. Poor and unsafe roads and highways, crumbling bridges, and nonexistent transit and transportation systems all contribute to and result in tribal economies that are third world in nature. 
In addition to facilitating the delivery of basic social services such as health, education, and nutrition to tribal members, solid physical infrastructures act as an incentive to outside investors to invest in tribal economies and to locate their businesses on tribal lands. 
The legislation I am cosponsoring today recognizes the special Federal obligations, and will assist in the development and maintenance of Indian transportation infrastructures and in the process pave the way for higher levels of economic growth and job creation. 
By increasing the funds available for the Indian reservation roads program, this bill will provide immediate relief to those tribes that have a backlog of road development and maintenance. By strengthening the capacity of tribes through transportation enhancement activities, the reservation bridges programs, and technical centers, this legislation will ensure that Indian tribes are not precluded from building stronger, more vibrant communities. 
I urge my colleagues to join in enacting this legislation so critical to tribal governments and economies across the Nation.

Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I appreciate being able to speak on behalf of Mr. PenAE6a for a couple of minutes. 
I have known Federico PenAE6a personally and professionally for over 15 years, Mr. President. I know him first as a friend and I know him as a professional with the highest integrity. He was that kind of a legislator when he was the minority leader of our State legislature. He was that kind of a mayor, as the mayor of our largest city of Denver. He was that kind of person when he was Secretary of the Department of Transportation. 
His resume reflects an unsurpassed commitment and dedication to public service. His achievements display remarkable leadership, vision, and hard work. 
Mr. PenAE6a leaves an indelible mark on every project he undertakes. The now famous Denver International Airport was a product of his foresight and leadership. The Department of Transportation, where he served as a Secretary for 4 years, is now leaner and more effective than it once was--success in taming and trimming a vast bureaucracy that can only be accomplished with discipline, determination, and hard work that Federico PenAE6a was willing to put in. 
Despite the many professional attributes Mr. PenAE6a has, and the many dimensions of professionalism he brings to public service, perhaps none are so important in our work as his honesty and integrity. This is a quality the Federal Government cannot afford to turn down. 
Having known him for the many years that I have, I am convinced that Federico PenAE6a will bring to the Department of Energy the same integrity, honesty, and leadership for which he is known. That is his indelible mark that he has left on our State and our U.S. Government. 
I simply urge my colleagues to support the nomination when it comes up this afternoon, and I thank the Senator for yielding these couple of minutes. I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, who has put so much effort into this issue. 
Mr. President, as the Senate prepares for the final vote on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, I again offer my support for the passage of this critical piece of legislation. 
Over the course of the last several weeks, I have listened to many of my colleagues as they have come to the floor to debate the merits or the detriments of the amendment. I have listened to many of my constituents during my travels through Colorado, most recently at town meetings in Colorado Springs, Trinidad, Longmont, Greeley, and Golden. I also have reviewed mail that has come into my office here in Washington, DC, addressing this important issue. And I must say I am greatly pleased by the large number of people who support the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
As I've indicated, I have been conducting a series of town meetings in my home State of Colorado. When the discussion turns to balancing the budget, the majority of Coloradans realize that we can only begin to address this issue with constitutional authority. I have also received numerous letters from special interest groups located here in Washington, DC, asking me to vote against the will of the American people and against the amendment. Well, I am not going to do that. I support the balanced budget constitutional amendment and have supported it since becoming a Member of Congress back in 1987. 
I believe this amendment is in the best interest of the future of this country, and I become frustrated to hear some of the arguments against this amendment, such as in the letters I receive from special interest groups. For instance, opponents claim that the amendment would limit the Federal Government's ability to address short-term economic crises or threats to our national security. Well, we have heard this argument on numerous occasions over the past few weeks, as well as over the years. Many of my colleagues have addressed this issue, and in fact, we have even voted on several amendments relative to these concerns. 
Section 1 and section 5 of the amendment, as it is currently written and was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary, provide Congress with the ability to waive the requirements of the amendment, so I do not find this argument against the amendment to be particularly compelling. 
Another often repeated argument against the amendment claims that Congress can balance the budget on its own without passing the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Well, folks, I have been a member of this institution for 10 years now, and I have yet to see a balanced budget or one that even approaches balance. In fact, there has not been a balanced budget since 1969. Congress has even passed deficit-reduction legislation on numerous occasions in an effort to achieve a balanced budget, and we still cannot get to a balanced budget. 
This constitutional amendment will make the Federal Government accountable to the Constitution when formulating a budget, and by doing so, this amendment will force the Federal Government to behave in a fiscally responsible manner just as more than half of the States are already required to do. 
Again, opponents argue that a balanced budget constitutional amendment will only lead to devastating cuts to many federally funded programs. Well, I certainly do not argue that this amendment will not force Congress and the administration to make some tough choices. Tough choices need to be made in order to balance the budget. But what is the alternative? 
Because of our inability to balance the budget, we continually run a deficit each year. Our country currently has a national debt of over $5.3 trillion--and it is growing--and each and every year the Federal Government pays interest on this debt. In fiscal year 1996, this Government spent $344 billion on interest costs, roughly 15 percent of the entire Federal budget for that year. Let me repeat this. The Federal Government spent $344 billion on interest costs last year, and of this $344 billion, not $1 of it went to education, law enforcement, highways, or even healthcare. At 15 percent of the Federal budget, interest costs are our third largest expenditure, and it continues to grow. 
What does this mean? It means that our national debt is strangling the rest of the budget. My friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, has been on this floor each and every day of this debate arguing in favor of this 
amendment, and I believe he best put this whole issue of interest payments in perspective. If my colleagues will indulge me, I would like to reiterate some of my colleague's comments from a couple of weeks ago because I think they need to be continuously repeated in order to drive home the importance of balancing the budget and ending the escalation of our national debt. 
As my friend from Utah stated once before, the Federal Government spent more money last year on net interest payments than it did for the combined budgets of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Labor, the Department of State, and the Department of Transportation. Our inability to balance the budget over the years has contributed to an enormous debt which requires more money to service annually than we are able to put toward the combined budgets of ten departments within the Federal Government. 
If we do not get a handle on the budget, we will continue to add to our national debt. In the long-term this debt, and the costs that accrue in interest, will endanger the funding for those programs that truly need, deserve, and require Federal funding. Of course, as this problem continues to escalate, it will be our children and our children's children who will be forced to deal with this problem. It will be they who will be hurt by low levels of funding--all because we did not seize the opportunity to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
And yet, there are still those who oppose the balanced budget constitutional amendment--who think that Congress can balance the budget on its own. Well, we have not done so in the last 28 years, and without this amendment I see no possible way that we can do so. If we were able to pass a budget plan this year which would balance the budget by the year 2002, without the constitutional requirement there is nothing to stop future Congresses and future administrations from implementing unbalanced budgets. 
And each year we fail to balance the budget, we run a deficit. These deficits will continue to add to the debt, increasing it and the size of the interest payments on the debt we leave to our children. It is estimated that in the year 2002 the interest payments will be $412 billion. It will continue to increase thereafter unless we find the fortitude to control our spending. 
You know, as legislators we should realize that our constituents expect certain things of us and of the Federal Government, and they rightly should. They trust us when we pledge our support for legislation such as this, and they have a right to expect our support when the time comes to vote. All of us meet with constituents and constituency groups, and barely a day goes by that we do not hear someone asking for our support for funding for certain programs or to work to increase funding for others. However, the fact of the matter is that money is scarce, and if we continue to run deficits and add to the national debt, it is going to become increasingly difficult to fund programs at the level they need and deserve. 
This body is going to vote on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, and it makes me angry to think it may fail to pass--once again by possibly only one vote. It makes me angry because this legislation and all of the same debates will continue to come up in future Congresses until one Congress has the good sense and courage to pass this measure and send it on to the States where it rightly belongs for ratification. As Members of the United States Congress, we often think that we know best on every single issue. Well, this is an issue we should send to the States and the American people, to finally provide them with the opportunity to debate the merits of this amendment and allow them to have the final decision. 
Mr. President, for 3 weeks we have seen every chart, we have viewed every graph, we have heard every point of view, and in some cases we have looked for every hole in which to hide in an effort to scuttle the balanced budget amendment. 
In my view, the American people are not buying any more excuses, nor should they. The American people know that their elected leaders, just like the wage earner in their household, cannot spend themselves into prosperity. Regardless of our own personal and varying views in this Chamber, one inescapable question remains. That question is: Do we trust the people of this Nation? By not passing this amendment we are telling them that we do not trust them, that we don't trust them to do the right thing in making decisions that will affect our lives. We, from our lofty perch in the U.S. Senate, will relieve them of the decision by not letting them discuss the balanced budget amendment in their State legislatures and in their hometowns. No one knows if the necessary 38 States would actually ratify the balanced budget amendment. But to not even allow the citizens of our home State the opportunity to review it, I find rather arrogant on our part. Let's not insult our constituents with that denial. They do not take this issue lightly any more than we do. But they also know that eight balanced budgets out of 66 years simply isn't good enough for America. 
Let's pass this important bill and give this Nation a chance. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with mixed emotions. I'm glad because a colleague is moving on to new opportunities, but I'm also saddened by the fact that the Senate, and in particular the Committee on Indian Affairs, is losing a great friend, Steven Heeley. 
Steve's work on native American issues goes back many years, to when he started with Senator McCain as the deputy minority staff director and Counsel for the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in 1989. He moved across the Hill to the House of Representatives, where I first had the pleasure of working with him, when Steve served as the deputy counsel on Indian affairs for the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs under Chairman George Miller. Later he became the counsel to the Subcommittee on Native American Affairs of the Natural Resources Committee of the House. Steve returned to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 1995 to become Chairman McCain's staff director and chief counsel. 
His lengthy list of accomplishments represents the kind of man Steve is: hard working and committed to Indian Country. Steve's work on environmental issues in Indian country includes the Clean Water and Clean Air Act amendments, solid waste disposal, leaking underground storage tanks and the Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act. His broad range of knowledge was crucial in passing the Self-Determination Act amendments, as well as self-governance legislation, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and the Navajo-Hopi Settlement Act. 
Steve's work to reauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, his work with tribal courts and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act show his concern for native Americans and most important, our mutual heritage. The work that has been important to Steve was the work that was important to Indian people across this country. Much of his work, including reorganizing the Bureau of Indian Affairs and amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is not yet complete, but his mark will certainly be on the changes when they do occur. 
Steve's work on behalf of Indian people goes back before his time here in Washington. He served as the assistant general counsel for the Gila River community in Arizona and was a staff attorney for the Four Rivers Indian Legal Services Program at Gila River. Now, Steve is going back to Arizona, where I'm sure he's been missed, as we're going to miss him here. 
I would like to offer my personal thanks to Steve for the invaluable service he has provided to me as I took over as Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee. His wise counsel to both me and my staff has made a difficult job more easy and has helped to make sure that the leadership Senator McCain brought to this committee will continue. 
Steve has been an outstanding advocate, leader, and friend to Indian country. On behalf of all of us who have been lucky enough to work him, we thank him, we wish him good luck, and we look forward to working together again.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for the past ten years I have spoken out in favor of a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, and have supported and voted for this measure each time I have had the opportunity to do so. 
In fact, in preparing for this statement, I looked back on my career in Congress to see how many times I have supported this measure, and I noted with interest that in January 1987, my first month of being a member of the House of Representatives, I joined as an original cosponsor to the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. One of the primary sponsors of the legislation on the House side was my colleague, Senator Craig, and on the Senate side, Senator Hatch was in the forefront introducing the measure in this body. It is with great pleasure that I join my friends in this effort once again, along with well over 50 of my Senate colleagues. 
Opponents believe it would be easy to give up on the idea of passing the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. For a number of years, despite the hard work of many individuals, this measure has failed to pass through Congress and move on to the states for ratification where it belongs. I believe passage of this Amendment is in the best interest of the future of our country because it will force us to make the tough decisions now that need to be made to balance the budget and eventually eliminate the staggering debt that threatens the economic well-being of every American. 
Now, there are those that believe there is no need for the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment--that the federal government can be fiscally responsible without being mandated by the Constitution to do so. Well, I have been a Member of Congress for 10 years now, and I have yet to see Congress or the administration bite the bullet, balance the budget, and tackle our enormous debt. 
Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office released one of its annual reports making projections on the economic and budget outlook for Fiscal Years 1998-2007. According to CBO, last year's deficit was $107 billion, making it the fourth year in a row that the deficit has decreased. However, the news is not all good. CBO also projects that the deficit will increase for Fiscal Year 1997 to become $124 billion. And, if we do not commit ourselves to balancing the budget, and discretionary spending keeps pace with inflation, this country will be faced with a deficit estimated at $278 billion in 2007. 
What does all this mean? It means that nothing ever changes. Year after year we are faced with huge deficits and an increasing national debt. Year after year we talk about doing the right thing, the responsible thing, and passing a balanced budget. And yet, once again, here we are debating the merits of the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. 
Back in my home state of Colorado, I have been conducting a series of town meetings, discussing a wide range of issues with my friends and constituents. When the discussion turns to balancing the budget, Coloradans realize that if we do not address this important issue with Constitutional authority, the amount of the federal budget devoted toward paying off the interest on the debt and the entitlement programs will increase to the point that there will be barely any money left for those programs which deserve and require Federal funding. 
Currently, more than half of the $1.6 trillion in spending goes toward the entitlements and mandatory spending. According to CBO, `if current policies remain unchanged, mandatory spending will be twice as large as discretionary spending by 2002.' In addition, another 15 percent of all outlays goes toward interest costs on the debt. This is money that does not go toward education, law enforcement, national security, or even our national parks and monuments. As far as I am concerned, it is wasted money. My constituents realize this, and on their behalf I continue to fight for the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. 
Now, I am not saying that this Amendment will be the silver bullet which solves all of our problems. However, it will make us accountable to the Constitution and to the will of a majority of Americans and force us to get our fiscal house in order. If we achieve a balanced budget and reduce the deficit, we can expect even lower interest rates, an increased savings rate, and increased economic growth for every American. Essentially, Americans can expect an increase in their standard of living, and I think that is something everyone of us wants and deserves. 
Congress came within one vote last session of passing the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. I am optimistic that this year we can pass this legislation and send the measure on to the states for their deliberation. It is time to allow the American people and the state legislatures the opportunity to debate the merits of the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, and I hope that the Congress will see fit to entrust this measure to those who must ratify or reject it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today my colleagues, Senators Chuck Grassley and Byron Dorgan, introduced legislation which will correct a tax problem facing many farmers across the country, including many in the State of Colorado. Along with over 40 of my Senate colleagues, I am pleased to join Senators Grassley and Dorgan as an original cosponsor to this bill. 
Farmers have typically used the deferred payment contract system as a means for managing their business income. It is common for a farmer to forward contract to sell a product. Under this type of contract, a farmer may deliver the product in a given tax year, and he may not receive one lump-sum payment at the time of delivery. In fact, the payments may be spread over 2 tax years. 
Up until recently, the farmer was taxed on this income only for the actual amount received in a given tax year. However, last October, the Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling which disallows this practice. Under the ruling, all payments received under a deferred payment contract are subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Now, regardless of whether the actual payments under the contract are spread out over a multiple year period, the payments will be taxable in the year the contract is made. 
Needless to say, this ruling requiring farm families to pay a tax on income they have not yet received places an unfair burden on those families. Farmers cannot control the weather, especially in Colorado where farmers fall victim to everything from tornados to droughts. Because of the uncertainties inherent in farming, deferred payment contracts offer farmers a critical financial management tool. We must allow them to manage the risks without unfairly penalizing them. 
With the farmers' early filing deadline looming on the horizon, there is a need to act upon this legislation as quickly as possible. Many farmers are already calculating their taxes for their early deadline and without a reversal of the IRS' ruling, they will be forced to comply at what will no doubt be a severe financial burden for many. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation and pass it in a timely manner.

Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for many years I have spoken out in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, and have supported and voted for this measure each time I have had the opportunity to do so. Now, once again, I join many of my colleagues as an original cosponsor of the Balanced Budget Amendment which is being introduced today, and I applaud Senator Orrin Hatch, Majority Leader Trent Lott, and the leadership for making this particular item a top priority for the 105th Congress. 
It would be so easy to give up on the idea of passing the Balanced Budget Amendment. For a number of years, despite the hard work of many individuals, this measure has failed to pass through Congress and move on to the states for ratification where it belongs. However, I believe passage of this Amendment is in the best interest of the future of this country. It will force us to make the tough choices that need to be made to balance the budget and eventually eliminate the staggering debt. 
There are those that believe there is no need for the Balanced Budget Amendment, that Congress can continually balance the budget without being mandated by the Constitution to do so. However, I have been a member of this institution for ten years now, and I have yet to see Congress and the administration bite the bullet, balance the budget, and tackle our enormous debt. If we do not address this important issue, the amount of the federal budget devoted toward paying off the interest on the debt and the entitlement programs will increase to the point that there will be barely any money left for those programs which deserve and require federal funding such as education, law enforcement, national security, or even our national parks and monuments. I think we owe more to the American people and to future generations. 
For those of us who remain committed to this effort, this piece of legislation is a vital tool for tackling the difficult task of balancing the budget. I would like to see an increase not only in our standard of living and national savings rate but also in the amount of money the Federal Government devotes to worthwhile and beneficial programs--programs which could suffer due to our financial troubles. 
Congress came within one vote last session of passing the Balanced Budget Amendment. I am optimistic that this year we can pass this legislation and send the measure on to the states for their deliberation. It is time to allow the American people and the State legislatures the opportunity to debate the merits of the Balanced Budget Amendment, and I hope that the Congress will see fit to entrust this measure to those who must ratify or reject it.
