Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the omnibus appropriations bill this morning, but I did so with some reluctance. While I am marginally pleased with this bill's contribution to education and defense, my primary concern is the $20.9 billion in emergency spending included in this bill that further jeopardizes the Social Security trust fund. 
In July, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the Federal Government will run a $63 billion surplus in 1998 if the Social Security trust fund is included in the budget calculations. We still run a $41 billion deficit, however, if the surplus in the Social Security trust fund is excluded. The Federal Government will not run a surplus without the inclusion of the Social Security trust fund until 2002, when CBO expects a $1 billion surplus. By 2008, the surplus will rise to $64 billion, without counting the Social Security trust fund. 
However, the omnibus appropriations package includes $20.9 billion in emergency spending--spending outside of the caps established in last year's balanced budget agreement, spending that is not paid for with offsets in other government programs. 
So how are we paying for $20.9 billion in emergency spending? We're using money from the surplus--a surplus that doesn't exist yet unless we include the Social Security trust fund in our calculations. 
I am dismayed by this outcome, especially when I recall the way we started this year. The President urged Congress to `Save Social Security First' during his State of the Union Address in January. In late April, the President again stated, `I will resist any proposals that would squander the budget surplus, whether on new spending programs or new tax cuts until Social Security is strengthened for the long-term.' 
Apparently, the President is ignoring his own advice. During negotiations over the appropriations package, the President pushed for $20 billion in so-called emergency spending. He did not propose to offset this spending with cuts in other Government programs. In fact, by categorizing his spending requests as `emergencies,' he plans to spend a large part of the surplus he himself designated for saving Social Security in January. 
Frankly, I question the legitimacy of the `emergencies' identified by the President--the year 2000 computer problem, military responsibilities in Bosnia, and the decennial census. These so-called emergencies have been on the radar screen for years. Unfortunately, the President failed to place a priority on these challenges when he gave Congress his budget in February. 
Now we have several `emergencies' for which the President is willing to dip into the surplus he deemed sacred in January--a surplus that does not exist unless we tap into the Social Security trust fund. 
Unfortunately, Congress capitulated to the President's inconsistent demands and policies. Today 
we approved a spending package that dips into the surplus that should be used to reform Social Security--a surplus that only exists with the current, but temporary, surplus in the Social Security trust fund. 
Social Security reform is expected to top next year's congressional agenda. Unfortunately, this spending package starts us off on the wrong foot. 
The President is willing to stick to his commitment to `Save Social Security First' when he wants to deny taxpayers tax relief. However, the surplus appears to be fair game when we are unwilling to make the tough choices needed to fund reprogramming government computers for the Year 2000, our continued military presence in Bosnia, or a responsibility as old as the Constitution--the decennial census. 
Finally, I would like to stress my sincere hope that Congress and the President will engage in a constructive and honest debate over how to reform the Social Security system next year. We can't politicize this issue--our children and grandchildren depend on an honest and bipartisan reform of a system that will not meet its obligations for the next generation of retirees. 
After declaring Social Security a priority during the State of the Union Address, the White House fell silent--invoking the famous pledge only when politically expedient. After President Clinton's speech, a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have made tough choices and released Social Security reform packages. The White House must engage in this process. We do need to save Social Security first. 
While I admit that I do not approve of the manner in which the emergency spending was added to this bill, I am pleased that it provides a much needed additional $7.5 billion for the Department of Defense to ensure the readiness of our nation's armed forces, to tackle the Y2K problem and sets aside funding for a ballistic missile defense. After 14 straight years of declining defense spending, the readiness of U.S. Armed Forces is clearly at risk. 
By 2003, active duty military personnel strength will decline almost in half from 2.2 million to 1.36 million, the number of active Army divisions will drop from 18 to 10, the number of Navy ships will drop from 569 to 346, and the number of Air Force fighter wings will be decreased from 25 to 13. 
At the same time, we are spending more of our defense resources on peacekeeping missions and our military personnel are spending more and more time on overseas deployments and less time training. If this trend continues it is unlikely the U.S. armed forces will not be the preeminent military force they were during the gulf war. 
Unless we take action now to modernize our weapons systems, aircraft, and ships, other nations may catch up to the U.S. technologically, placing our military personnel at greater risk and eroding the tactical advantages they enjoy on the battlefield today. We must work to ensure that our fighter planes, tanks, submarines, and missiles are the best in the world. 
This bill provides $1.1 billion to fund urgent readiness shortfalls in the services, such as flying hours, spare parts, depot maintenance, personnel recruiting and retention initiatives. 
One billion is also set aside for a strategic anti-ballistic missile defense system. I'm pleased that appropriators recognized this priority as rogue states aggressively pursue the acquisition of nuclear and chemical weapons technology. It is disappointing that the efforts of my colleague Senator Cochran to pass legislation to establish a National Missile Defense system has failed two times this year by a margin of only one vote. 
Not surprisingly, education was another issue the White House demagogued in this process for political purposes. This is a debate I personally welcome. This year's spending negotiations drew a bright line between the President and Republicans. The amount of money was never an issue. In fact, our budget agreement matched dollar-for-dollar the President's request for education spending. The debate was not about money--but about who gets to spend it. 
Some Republican priorities were clearly represented in the omnibus package. This bill includees a $32.7 billion investment in our children's education; $91 million more than the President requested for disadvantaged students and $500 million more than the President thought we should spend on special education. And this bill includes $1.2 billion for school districts to hire new teachers. 
This last program, providing new teachers for our nation's schools provided a real opportunity to debate the fundamentally different approach Republicans and Democrats have toward our nation's schools. Who do you trust with our children's education? Bureaucrats in Washington DC? Or those who know our children by name--their parents, teachers, and locally elected school board members. 
Through this process it was clear that the President simply wanted to repeat the pattern of more top down control from Washington DC, new rules and regulations, more bureaucrats and more paperwork meaning that less money reaches our nation's classrooms. 
According to the House Education at the Crossroads report, we already have some 760 Federal education programs, requiring over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year. Both the House and Senate recognize that we simply cannot continue to add to that burden. Earlier this year both bodies approved measures which would radically change the way education funs are spent. The House approved the Dollars to the Classroom Act on September 18, 1998 and the Senate approved my block grant approach earlier this year on the Coverdell education savings account bill. Both proposals support the same philosophical approach, education decisions should be made by those closest to our children--their parents, teachers and locally elected school board members--not Washington, DC bureaucrats. 
This new initiative to hire teachers represents a first step toward trusting local decisions regarding our children's education. Republicans were responsible for making sure that 100% of this new money would be spent by our local school districts not by Federal or State bureaucrats. Schools will be able to hire teachers for any grade, no matter where the need is and schools may hire special education teachers; neither would have been possible under the President's prescriptive proposal. 
Importantly, few rules and regulations will accompany this new money. The President wanted to add this money to a program that already has 171 pages of `non-regulatory guidance' from the Federal Government. With the Federal Government providing only 6 percent of the funding for our local schools, and 50 percent of the regulation and paperwork--it was important that we not add to that burden. Republicans insisted that this new money be funneled through an existing block grant program. 
In a 1997 State of Education speech, Secretary Riley said, `* * * we should not cloud our children's future with silly arguments about Federal Government intrusion.' 
But that is exactly what this debate was and is about--and it couldn't be more important. It will again be the focus of debate next year as Congress works to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
I will continue to work in the 106th Congress to save Social Security and to restore authority over our children's education to those who are closest to our children--their parents, teachers, principals, and locally elected school board members.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a small but important element of the Omnibus appropriations measure is the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, and more specifically, a provision within this Act that recognizes that Washington state's claim to the name `Olympic' is both first in time, and first in right over the claim of the United States Olympic Committee. 
Vital geographic features that dominate and define the State of Washington, Mount Olympus in the Olympic Mountain range, within the Olympic National Forest on the massive Olympic Peninsula, were named long before Congress chartered the USOC and permitted it to use the word `Olympic' to raise money to support the Olympic games and encourage the USOC's activities. In an opinion interpreting the current statute, the United States Supreme Court noted that it was fair for Congress to allow the USOC to receive the benefit of its efforts to promote and distinguish the word `Olympic.' In the same vein, however, where the use of the word `Olympic' has geographical significance that pre-dates and is independent of the USOC, it is only fair that the USOC not be able to interfere with this use. 
Although there are relatively few instances in which the USOC, crying `mine, mine, mine,' has gone after any of the thousands of businesses in Washington state that use the word `Olympic,' the attitude that the USOC has displayed in these few instances demands correction. I would like to thank State Representative Jim Buck for bringing them to my attention. I am as much a sports enthusiast as the next person, and it has never been my intent to undermine the USOC's ability to raise money through licensing. The USOC remains a creature of Congress, however, and it is incumbent on us to prescribe reasonable limits--to remind the Committee that its privilege to the use of the word `Olympic' is not absolute, and is secondary, for example, to the rights of geographic reference on the part of Washington state businesses. The provision that I have included in the Amateur Sports Act serves as a statutory admonition that the USOC must share the word `Olympic'. 
The need for a reasonable restriction on the USOC, which I believe this bill contains, is widely recognized in Washington state. On September 25, The News Tribune wrote that we have `produced a reasonable and narrow compromise that will protect Washington businesses and protect the USOC's legitimate concerns.' The Seattle Times concurred when it urged the Olympic Committee members to `get over their Olympic-sized egos and support this modest and sensible tweaking of the law.' 
Having just chastised the USOC for its past abuses, let me say that I am heartened by the assurances and commitments the Committee made during discussion of my amendment, assurances that the past abuses were anomalous and inconsistent with USOC policy, and commitments that the USOC will not abuse its privileges with respect to the use of the word `Olympic.' I trust the Committee will live up to its promise to rein in its organizing committees and other affiliated entities' overzealous pursuit of businesses using the name `Olympic,' even when there is no likelihood that such use will be confused with the Olympic games or activities of the USOC. 
The language in the omnibus bill is narrower than what I had included in the bill that passed the Commerce Committee. The `safe harbor' created for Washington as a subterfuge to obtain immunity from USOC action, then quickly extend their business, goods, or services to other locations, such as Salt Lake City, the site of the next Winter Olympics, with the intent of capitalizing on the games. 
To allay the USOC's concerns, the final language creates a clear safe harbor for businesses using the word `Olympic' when they operate and conduct most of their sales and marketing west of the Cascades. This safe harbor will remove the threat that hangs over the thousands of businesses in Western Washington--the threat that the USOC will deprive them of the ability to continue to use the word `Olympic.' 
Henceforth, Olympic Cleaners in Kirkland, Olympic Auto Sales in Kent, Olympic Golf Repair in Port Angeles, Olympic Ambulance in Sequim, as well as thousands of other businesses in Washington, can rest assured that a creature of the Federal government, the USOC, won't come knocking to collect, not only their taxes, but their name. 
Finally, I point out that the language is silent about what happens if the business using the word `Olympic' substantially extends its operations, sales, and marketing beyond Western Washington. It certainly is not the intent of Congress to place Washington businesses using the word `Olympic,' in a geographical cage that constrains their growth so long as the operations of these Washington businesses do not wrongfully capitalize on the work of the USOC by confusing people into making an association with the Olympic games, and not the Olympic Mountain range, Olympic Peninsula, or other geographic features. No court should infer that, in creating the safe harbor for businesses in Western Washington, Congress intended in any way to affect the current law with respect to businesses operating outside of this area. We did not.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, after threatening to filibuster an appropriations measure over provisions relating to S. 1221, the American Fisheries Act, I now want to emphasize my support of the substitute version of the American Fisheries Act that has been included in this mammoth bill. 
It has been an unexpected privilege and a pleasure to work with, as opposed to against, the Senior Senator from Alaska and his staff on legislation affecting the allocation and management of pollock in the North Pacific. Together, we have crafted a substitute measure designed to achieve the goals of his original legislation, which aimed to Americanize and decapitalize the North Pacific pollock fishery. Not only is this substitute, in my view, fundamentally more fair than the original S. 1221, it is considerably better in that it allows for new methods of managing the largest fishery in the United States, methods that promise to end the race for fish and to ensure that the decapitalization is permanent. 
Americanization, decapitalization, and rationalization. These were the three things most participants in the pollock fishery said that they wanted from legislation when I convened an industry meeting in Seattle during the August recess. To these goals, I added my own: no summary elimination of foreign-controlled vessels without compensation, and the protection of independent pollock harvesters and processors. 
Due largely to the perseverance of Senator Stevens, the consensus that eluded the pollock industry in August was reached a month later. The basic elements of the September accord called for increasing the U.S. ownership and control requirements for all fishing vessels; arranging for the buy out by the onshore sector of a significant portion of the pollock catch and of nine Norwegian-controlled vessels; limiting the amount of fish that any one company can harvest and process; and laying the groundwork for a new management scheme to eliminate the race for fish by limiting participants in the pollock fishery and permitting these participants to decide in advance how to divide the resource. 
Translating the agreement-in-concept into legislation in the few weeks that remained in this Congress was a tremendous challenge. A myriad of questions arose, and we attempted to answer them as best we could with input from the participants in the pollock and other fisheries, state officials, North Pacific Fishery Management Council members, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, Community Development Quota representatives, and others. 
As we progressed through various drafts of the legislation, we tried to anticipate and address issues like how to require and enforce greater U.S. ownership and control of fishing vessels without disrupting existing and future financing arrangements; the effects of the transfer of fish from the offshore sector on the product mix; ensuring that catcher vessels have sufficient input into the formation and conduct of fishery cooperatives; preventing the vessels being removed from the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone from contributing to overcapacity in other fisheries; and many, many others. 
One of the most difficult issues is how to protect participants in other fisheries from possible adverse effects of ending the race for pollock. Crabbers and other groundfish fishers are concerned that pollock fishers who participate in cooperatives will spend more time and effort in other, already overcapitalized, fisheries. After considering various legislative proposals to limit effort in other fisheries, I believe we made the right choice to leave this task to the regional councils. Because the measures to end the race for fish in the onshore and mothership sectors will not go into effect until 2000, we delegated to the North Pacific and the Pacific Fishery Management Councils the responsibility of ensuring that the new cooperative management regime provided for in this legislation does not decapitalize and rationalize the pollock fishery at the cost of further overcapitalizing other fisheries. For the offshore sector, which we anticipate will form cooperatives and stop racing for fish in 1999, before the regional management councils have an opportunity to impose restrictions on these vessels, we prescribed limits on participation in other fisheries. 
One of the questions for which we could not get a definitive answer is whether we have appropriated enough money to cover the cost of the loan that will be used for the vessel buy out. A critical element of this bill is the purchase of nine pollock catcher processor vessels and their pollock fishing history. In exchange for being allocated significantly more fish, and permanently eliminating these nine vessels from all U.S. fisheries, the onshore pollock sector has agreed to pay $75 million to the vessel owners. This $75 million will be advanced as a loan by the federal government, and repaid to the federal government by the onshore sector over a long period of time. This $75 million payment from the onshore sector to the offshore sector is supplemented in this bill by a $20 million federal appropriation, so that the total payment to the offshore catcher processors is $95 million. Of this amount, $90 million is to be paid to the owners of the nine catcher processors being excluded. The additional $5 million is to be paid to the catcher processors whose allocation is reduced even though their vessels are not removed. 
Because the nine vessels are to be excluded and the allocation to catcher processors to be reduced on January 1, 1999, we have provided that the buy out payments to the owners and the catcher processors be made before the end of 1998. To do this, we have appropriated the $20 million federal share of the buy out, and an additional $750,000 for the cost of the direct loan of $75 million. The $750,000 is one percent of the loan amount, and is the amount that both NMFS and the Office of Management and Budget believe is enough to cover the cost of the $75 million loan. Because this type loan is unprecedented, however, OMB has been unable to say with absolute certainty that $750,000 is the correct amount. 
If OMB determines that $750,000 is insufficient to cover the cost of the $75 million loan, we expect OMB and NMFS to inform us of this immediately, and to immediately secure sufficient funds to cover the cost of a direct loan of $75 million so that $90 million can be paid to the owners of the nine excluded vessels before the end of this year. These funds can be secured by reprogramming part of the $6 million provided to NMFS to carry out the provisions of this Act. 
Another question that has arisen recently involves the interpertation of the section that allows offshore catcher vessels to catch 8.5 percent of the pollock allocation reserved for these catcher boats and specified catcher processors. We included this section to ensure that the catcher boats delivering to catcher processors were not squeezed out of the sector. We anticipated that the fish caught by these catcher vessels would be delivered for processing only to the twenty catcher processors named in the bill as eligible to participate in the offshore pollock fishery and eligible to participate in a cooperative, and we did not intend for these catcher vessels to be able to increase the pollock processing capacity by delivering their catch to catcher processors other than the 20 listed vessels. 
But just as we did not have a definitive answer to the question of the cost of the loan guarantee, we did not have answers to many of the questions that arose from this proposal that so dramatically changes the operation of the largest fishery in the United States: we will rely heavily on the expertise of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and of NMFS, to flesh out many of the details of this truly revolutionary legislation. Even without all of the answers, however, I believe that we made the right decision to seize a unique opportunity to Americanize, decapitalize, and rationalize this fishery, and, at long last, bring peace to an industry whose internecine battles over the years have led to the inefficient operation of the pollock fishery and caused a rift between Washington and Alaska.

Mr. GORTON. Let me just add, both as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as a Senator from the State of Washington, that I agree that no money should be spent on implementing any such system at the land borders or seaports until we are assured that no adverse consequences will result. I am convinced that the consequences would be disastrous. I would also like to ask the distinguished Majority Leader for his support.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I can do no better than to echo the eloquent remarks of my friend and colleague from New Hampshire. The debate over education today is not a debate over its importance. It is not a debate over the relative commitment of Republicans and Democrats to increase the educational opportunities for our children. The debate, as we have it today, is over who determines how and where that money should be spent--bureaucrats in Washington, DC, or the parents, teachers, principals, and elected school board members in thousands of school districts across the United States. That debate is a vitally important one. 
In his 1997 state of education speech, Secretary Riley said, `We should not cloud our children's future with silly arguments about Federal Government intrusion.' But that is exactly what this debate is about. It isn't silly, and it couldn't possibly be more important. 
Secretary Riley may feel it very natural that he and the President and his bureaucrats in the Department of Education here in Washington, DC, should set those priorities for all of the thousands of school districts across the country. We do not. We believe in the wisdom of school board members and in the dedication of principals and teachers and parents to the quality of their children's education. 
I want to emphasize once again, the President in his budget this year asked for $31.4 billion for education. The budget passed by the Senate of the United States has $31.4 billion for education. Later, the President came back and asked for an additional $1.1 billion. Republicans have agreed that that $1.1 billion is appropriate. 
But in negotiations, of which I have been a part, the President has narrow prescriptions for the use of that $1.1 billion. In fact, when I looked at the statutory language that the President's people asked for, the first two lines were about the appropriation of $1.1 billion. 
All of the rest of the language was designed to restrict the discretion of State and local education agencies in connection with the spending of that $1.1 billion, narrowly focused on teachers, focused even more on teachers in the first three grades; subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Department of Education at every possible turn, the distribution formula and the set of rules already adopted for the spending of money from the pot into which this $1.1 billion is to go, according to the President. The formal rules take up just 15 pages of regulations--perhaps 15 pages too many. But the nonregulatory guidance for those regulations is another 171 pages. And, of course, there would have to be additional regulations on top of those, and additional guidance on top of those, for this program as the President has recommended it. 
In its publication called `Education At The Crossroads,' the Education Committee of the House of Representatives reports that there are now 760 Federal education programs, requiring something over 48,600,000 hours of paperwork per year--48,600,000 hours of paperwork. We simply need not add to that burden. Mr. President, 90 percent of those hours now paid for out of the education budgets of our school districts and of our States, 90 percent of those hours could be far more profitably spent on additional instruction for our students or the money spent on improving the physical quality of our schools or the equipment that our schools and our teachers use to train our children. But those moneys are now spent meeting the regulations of the Federal Government accompanying the modest amount of money--some 7 percent to 8 percent--the modest amount of money that the Federal Government supplies as against the States and local taxpayers for the maintenance and the instruction in our public school program. 
We, on the other hand, without a debate with the President over the amount of money to be spent on education, prefer that it be distributed through an existing Federal program, the one existing Federal program that carries very few regulations with it, directly to the school districts of the United States, to be spent in the way that each of those school districts feels most appropriate. More teachers? Yes, where those school districts feel that is their No. 1 priority. Focused on special education where, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, we have imposed innumerable burdens and regulations on our school districts but supply less than 10 percent of the money to meet those regulations? On other matters that may be more significant to particular school districts across the country? Yes. 
In discussion of this issue in the course of the last 24 hours with a distinguished Democratic Member of the House of Representatives on the committee there dealing with education, we were told that even in that Representative's own district, the school boards could not be trusted. This Representative was eloquent on the tumbled-down nature of many of the schools in his city, eloquent on the lack of adequate teaching in that school district, but he was totally unwilling to let the people who elected both him and the school board members in his city--he was unwilling to allow those elected school board members to decide how this new money should be used. He was convinced, for some reason or another, that they would ignore the condition of their schools and the quality of their teachers and find something else to spend the money on. 
Between that idea and ours, there is a great gulf fixed. We feel that if the school boards are allowed to determine how this money should be spent, it will, in the vast majority of all cases, be spent more wisely than it could possibly be spent under a set of one-size-fits-all regulations from Washington, DC, and we feel that there will be more money in the schools because less of it will be used for this 48-plus million hours of filling out paperwork. 
Those are the two principal reasons for our perspective on this issue--a trust in the dedication of the parents and teachers and principals and superintendents and school board members to the education of the children committed to their care, and to the belief that the less the paperwork, the fewer the regulations, the more dollars that can get actually into the classroom. 
That may be the last major issue separating us from the President in coming up with an overall omnibus budget and allowing this Congress to finish its work. But it is an issue of profound importance to every American--our students and our parents and all other Americans who wish to bequeath to their children and their grandchildren an even stronger America than the one they inherited from their parents.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at this desk on the floor of the Senate, I am surrounded by Indiana--the senior Senator from Indiana on my left, the junior Senator from Indiana on my right. Together, they have come to reflect the character of their sober, peaceful, and productive section of middle America. So close are the two Senators to one another, almost alone among Members of this body, they share offices in the State of Indiana, they share a strong and calm temperament, and they share a commitment to the people they represent and to the people of the United States. 
When this Congress adjourns in a few short hours, however, we will be losing one of those Senators, Dan Coats. Dan Coats has grown in wisdom and in the respect that his fellow Senators have for him in each of the 10 years during which he has served in the Senate--10 years that seem to me, in retrospect, to be all too short. With Dan Coats, what you see is what you get, a man who lives and defends and projects solid American values, a love of family, a love of country, a love of God, a man who works hard, a man whose convictions are strong and unshakeable but who combines with those convictions a willingness to listen to views different from his own and to reach accommodations on matters of policy when those accommodations do not shake his solid philosophical foundation. 
During the course of his 10 years in the Senate, Dan Coats has become a good friend. I do not believe I can say that he is my closest friend in the Senate, nor I his. I can say, however, that I will greatly miss his calm good humor, his ability to get to the central point of any debate over policy or political philosophy, his rich dedication to the Constitution of the United States, to this body, and to the friends he has made in this body. 
We are only 100 men and women in the Senate, Mr. President. We see a great deal of one another, and we see ourselves and our colleagues under great stress and under high pressures. As a consequence, it is very difficult for any of us to hide the vital features of our character or our personality from one another. Dan Coats, I must say, has never attempted to hide anything about his character or about his personality, and with me and with all of us it has worn well. He is the kind of individual whom you like and respect more and more with each passing day, and it is for just that reason that even if this Congress ends up by accomplishing many of the purposes that each of us as individuals set out to accomplish at the beginning of this Congress, we will still go home with an empty heart, knowing that those of us who return in January will return without the daily advice, counsel, and friendship of a magnificent U.S. Senator, Dan Coats of Indiana.

Mr. GORTON. For the information of all Senators, on Wednesday there will be a period of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate may begin debate in relation to the omnibus appropriations bill, notwithstanding whether or not the papers have been received from the House. It now appears likely that a rollcall vote will be requested on passage of the omnibus bill. Members will be given 24 hours notice when the voting schedule becomes available.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it has been interesting to listen to the Senator from Massachusetts beating so industriously upon a dead horse. But the issue before the Congress, I suspect, in these last few days is not going to be on the level of support that the Congress and our appropriations bill provides for the education of our children in all 50 States across the country. 
The debate now between the President and the leadership who are working on this budget is over who gets to spend it. The President believes, and the Senator from Massachusetts has outlined in his remarks a whole series of categorical aid programs--money for this specific program, money for that specific program--each of which carries with it its own bureaucracy here in Washington, DC, and, generally speaking, a bureaucracy of the State and always administrators in each school district to fill out all of the forms and to make all of the applications for assistance from the Federal Government. To that extent, an individual school district is lucky if 60 cents or 70 cents out of every dollar supposedly devoted by the Federal Government to education, in fact, ever gets to the classroom and to the students. 
No, the battle in these last few days is not going to be over whether or not we shouldn't supply perhaps another billion dollars or more than a billion dollars above what we are already appropriating for the education of our children. It is going to be over whether or not we trust the teachers, the parents, the principals, the superintendents, the elected school board members and thousands of school districts across the United States to determine how that money can be most effectively spent on their students.

Mr. GORTON. This Senate voted for just such a program last year. This Senate voted for just such a program this year. This Senate did so, I am convinced, because while the Federal Government, in spite of all of the speeches on the floor of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, comes up with only about 7 or 8 percent of the money that is spent in our schools that are, of course, primarily locally and State-operated, it comes up with 50 or 60 percent of the rules and regulations that must be met by our school districts, by hiring administrators, not teachers, people to fill out forms and read Federal regulations rather than librarians and new equipment for our students. 
It was our attempt last year, and has been our attempt this year, and I hope and trust will be our policy when we finish an appropriations bill in a few days, that we trust the people in the States and in our communities and in our schools to come up with better judgments about the varying priorities of their students than can President Clinton or a Department of Education bureaucracy here in Washington, DC. 
The thrust of the point that I have been attempting to make for a couple of years now is just exactly that: Where should this money be spent? Are we the experts here in this body on how each of 14,000 school districts should go about educating its children? Or is the true expertise in those school districts themselves?

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today in recognition of a young woman from my home state of Washington, Ms. Veronica Calvillo. Ms. Calvillo, a sophomore at Seattle University, is the recipient of a scholarship from the Hispanic College Fund. While I did not have the good fortune of attending the recent awards dinner at which Ms. Calvillo spoke, I have heard from many who did attend that she made a remarkable impression. After reading the remarks she made at that dinner, I can certainly understand why. Through her remarks, Ms. Calvillo shows herself to be an intelligent, mature and centered young woman. Ms. Calvillo and her family are truly an example of what is best about America. I ask that Ms. Calvillo's remarks be printed in the Congressional Record. 
The remarks follow.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I share the background of the Senator from Alabama as attorney general of my State. I agree with much of the philosophic underpinning of his remarks directed at the judicial philosophy of Mr. Fletcher. I disagree, however, as to the conclusion, and intend to vote for his confirmation. 
The Constitution of the United States says that the President shall nominate and by and with the advice of the Senate shall appoint judges to positions like the one we are debating here today. 
In my view--I have some differences even with my good friend from Utah on this subject--I believe that does permit a Senator to vote against a judicial nominee on the grounds that the Senator disagrees with the fundamental legal philosophy of that nominee. I also believe, however, that when the President has sought the advice as well as the consent of the Senate, and when that advice has been heated, at least to the extent of being given significant weight, it is then appropriate to vote for the confirmation of a judicial nominee, even though one, as an individual Senator, might well not have nominated that individual had he, the Senator, been President of the United States. 
That is the situation in which I find myself here. I have met with and talked about Mr. Fletcher's ambitions on two or three occasions at some length. I have found him to be a thoughtful, intelligent, hard-working individual dedicated to the law as he sees it, and, perhaps even more importantly than that, as the Constitution and the statutes of the United States lay it out. 
He would certainly not have been my first choice had I been the nominating authority in this case. But, I am not. I am an individual Senator. At the same time, the President of the United States and his officers have, in fact, sought my advice as well as my consent on judicial nominees, both to the district courts in the State of Washington, and to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when those nominees come from the State of Washington. 
While again I have not necessarily gotten my first choices for those positions, I believe that in a constitutional sense my advice has been sought and my advice has been given considerable weight by the President of the United States. 
As a consequence, the combination of the punctual adherence to constitutional requirements with my own belief that Mr. Fletcher will fill the position of a judge on the Ninth Circuit honorably, and in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, causes me to feel that he is a qualified nominee and that he should be confirmed by the Members of the Senate to the office to which the President has nominated him.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today in defense of an essential freedom--the right to make health care decisions outside of the governmental bureaucracy. Yet there is a segment of our population--our seniors--who have lost that freedom. At the administration's insistence a provision was included in the budget reconciliation bill of 1997 that prohibits physicians from participating in the Medicare program for two years if they accept private payment for services normally covered under the Medicare program from a patient who is eligible for Medicare--essentially trapping our seniors in a government controlled health care program. 
It is clear that the provisions included in the Balanced Budget Act are hurting seniors. One of my constituents stories was featured in the Reader's Digest. Ray Perry wanted to pay for routine screening tests for he and his wife because years before, prior to enrolling in Medicare, the Perry's had conducted a similar series of tests and were able to detect his wife's lymphatic leukemia very early when it was still treatable. Medicare decided not to pay for the tests because the Perrys didn't have certain symptoms that would indicate these tests were required. But, when the Perrys offered to pay out of their own pocket, the doctor still wouldn't order the tests for fear of being penalized by Medicare. While both the Perrys and their doctor wanted medical services that were clearly reasonable, and the Perrys were willing to pay for these services, the restrictions currently found in Medicare prevented them from getting the kind of health care they needed. 
It is unconscionable that in a nation founded on the principles of freedom that we would limit the freedom of the Perrys and millions of American seniors just like them.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the substitute amendment to S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Protection Act of 1998. 
The substitute makes a number of changes to the Committee-passed bill. While not as far reaching as some would like, I believe that the changes improve a measure that has always had a very laudable intent, but which was criticized nevertheless by attorneys general and consumer groups for preempting, in some instances, more favorable state law and not providing consumers with enough information about a vehicles' history. 
As a former Attorney General, I was particularly sensitive to these criticisms, and last Fall I placed a hold on the measure with the expectation of facilitating a consensus between the bill's supporters, the attorneys general, and various consumer advocate groups. Regrettably, a consensus of legislation was not to be had. While the changes in the amendment are generally intended to address concerns raised by the attorneys general and, to some extent, consumer advocates, neither of these groups has endorsed this measure. I removed my hold on the amendment despite this, however, because there is a consensus, of which I am a part, on the need for federal legislation regarding salvage and rebuilt vehicles. The bill, as amended, is not perfect. But as my months of trying to broker an agreement revealed, `perfect,' even if defined to mean the best interest of consumers, is a subjective term. S. 852, as amended, is, in my view, and in that of over 50 co-sponsors, better than the status quo. 
I remain troubled that the attorneys general and some consumer advocate groups do not agree. I am also somewhat baffled by the seemingly studied misconstruction of the bill, and my amendment to it by some who continue to oppose it. 
Let me explain the changes in the amendment to S. 852. In response to complaints that S. 852 set too high a damage threshold for designating a vehicle as `salvage,' the amendment lowers the threshold from 80% to the lower of 75% or the percentage threshold in a state as of the date of enactment. Seventy-five percent is the threshold recommended by the task force created by the Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992, on whose work this legislation is based. Industry defenders of the higher threshold argued that lowering it would hurt, not help, consumers because it would devalue vehicles even when there is no legitimate safety-related reason for mandating the disclosure of prior damage. I understand their point, but don't agree. Yes, there is some threshold at which mandatory labeling, and the bureaucratic burden that attends it, is more costly than beneficial for both buyers and sellers, but I do not believe we have come close to that turning point. 
The attorneys general's concern that S. 852 did not provide for sufficient disclosure applied not only to the percent of damage threshold, but also to limited scope of the vehicles covered by the bill. S. 852 proposed to permit the `salvage vehicle' label to attach only to vehicles less than seven years old or with more than $7500. While states were free to use any other label they chose for all vehicles, including older vehicles, state attorneys general wanted to be able to use the term `salvage' to describe older vehicles because it is the term most commonly used today to advise of prior damage. The amendment to S. 852 permits states to do this, and explicitly provides that states can use the term `older model salvage vehicle' to label older vehicles. 
Complaints about the mandatory nature of S. 852 ran the gamut. Some critics of S. 852, including the Department of Transportation, objected to the fact that states were not obligated to comply with the Act, arguing that states could opt out and become regional title washing capitals. Others complained that the bill was too prescriptive, and did not allow states (the majority of which, until now, do not appear to have adopted very consumer-friendly laws) to set the standards for labeling and disclosure. Rather than refight the battle that led the House to conclude that a mandate would be unconstitutional, and because I was unable to persuade anyone to agree that we should use a big stick as opposed to a carrot approach, the amendment to S. 852 does not make the labeling system mandatory, but incorporates a provision to address concerns that opt-out states will become title-washing capitals. The amendment to S. 852 makes it a violation of the Act to move vehicles, or 
vehicle titles, across state lines for the purpose of avoiding the requirements in the Act. 
Another minor modification to S. 852 corrects what I believe was an oversight in S. 852, and makes it a violation of the Act not to comply with the labeling and disclosure requirements for `flood vehicles.' 
Another modification made to S. 852 clarifies that states that choose to abide by the provisions of the Act must carry over not only the `salvage vehicle,' `nonrepairable vehicle,' and `flood vehicle' labels on titles, but also any other disclosure that states prescribe. This concept was contained in S. 852, but the language was unclear. The legislation does not restrict states from labeling a car with any term, and prescribing treatment of a car so labeled with any term, other than the very limited list of terms used in the bill. In other words, a state that accepts federal funds for the national motor vehicle identification number database, and that does not specifically state on its titles that it is not complying with the federal titling standards, must use the definition of `salvage vehicle' and `nonrepairable vehicle' prescribed in the bill. However, S. 852 permits that state to label the same vehicle with any other term it chooses and imposes any restrictions attendant to the other label. The amendment clarifies that states that chose to use the national labels, including those for `salvage vehicle' and `nonrepairable vehicle,' must not only carry over these labels from other states, but must also carry over any other labels another state chooses to affix, and specify the state that so labeled the vehicle. 
Other modifications specifically permit state attorneys general to bring actions on behalf of individuals for violations of the Act, and clarify that the Act in no way affects individuals' ability to bring private rights of action. In response to concerns that S. 852 preempted state causes of action and created a sole remedy for violations relating to title labeling and disclosure, the amendment specifically provides that the Act does not preclude any private right of action available under state law. This provision was intended to provide assurances that nothing in the Act restricts individuals, or attorneys general, from pursuing any claims under state law, such as claims based on violations of consumer protection laws, unfair trade practices, or failures to disclose the material terms of a contract. Curiously, the inclusion of this provision, designed to allay concerns about preemption, appears to have unreasonable stirred them. Some appear to have drawn the illogical and legally unsupported conclusion that any claim not specifically preserved is implicity barred. Let met again try to clarify. There is absolutely nothing in the bill that suggests that the remedies it provides (action by attorneys general) are exclusive. Simply because the legislation states that private actions are specifically preserved does not mean that all other actions are barred or restricted in any way. 
The modification that has drawn criticism even from those consumer groups whose interests I was attempting to advance in my amendment, is the striking of the criminal penalty provisions. This modification was not requested by anyone seeking to avoid accountability. Rather, I sought to strike the criminal penalties because I believe that the criminal sanctions in S. 852 were inappropriate in most instances, and unnecessary in others. As a general matter, I believe that Congress creates too many federal criminal offenses, when it should leave this task to state law. A violation of this bill, such as a failures to make disclosures about a vehicle's history, generally is not the type of violation for which people should be sent to jail. If the conduct is so egregious that criminal sanctions are warranted, then existing state laws against fraud, theft, and the like are available based on which to prosecute violators. 
The change I have just described to S. 852 are not extensive. They are, nevertheless, important and, in my opinion, improve a bill that is needed at this time.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on March 28, 1996, Congress passed the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act, most commonly referred to as the farm bill. This comprehensive, forward looking legislation provides U.S. agriculture the free market principles that our farmers and ranchers requested and desired. Government no longer dictates to farmers how much to plant, when to plant, when to buy, or when to sell. The farm bill provides the flexibility, predictability, and simplicity that our farmers and ranchers asked for from their government. 
In the past few months, agriculture in the United States has been impacted by chaotic world markets, natural disasters, and disease. These occurrences are not the result of the Farm Bill, but without a doubt have impacted the prices paid for U.S. commodities. As a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, I had the opportunity to review and subsequently pass a disaster package as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report. This package includes relief for those farmers who experienced one or all three of the aforementioned occurrences. 
The Pacific Northwest is experiencing misfortune that is not weather or disease related, but market related. Producers in the State of Washington rely heavily on international trade. Wheat growers in the state export approximately 85 percent of their crop. Our apple and minor crop industries rely heavily on Asia as an export market. When world markets collapse, so too does the price paid for each of these commodities. 
The disaster package which is included in the conference report provides some relief for growers in Washington state. However, because a bulk of the assistance provided in the package will benefit farmers in the mid-west states, I voted with Senator Burns to increase the relief plan by $610 million. Although this plan was defeated, I believe the overall package is adequate and a necessary starting point for recharging the cash flow to the family farm. This package, combined with the Agriculture Market Transition Act payments farmers will receive in October and December of this year, and the loan deficiency payments for program crops totals over $17 billion in cash payments for 1998 and 1999. 
Because Pacific Northwest agriculture is so trade dependent, I believe we must focus on expanding trade and gaining new markets. In this arena, I fear that the administration's silence has been deafening. 
Two weeks ago the House defeated the bill to provide the President fast track-trade negotiating authority. Unfortunately, a wounded President and a weak Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture failed to convince our colleagues the importance of passing this legislation. With one in four jobs in the State of Washington directly related to trade, and with agriculture being the State's number one employer, the passage of fast track was essential. 
Just last week I made a statement regarding the administration's trade policy with China. Finally, a member of the Administration commented on the inability of the President to make headway with China's protectionist position. The Undersecretary of International Trade at the Department of Commerce admitted that U.S. trade policy with China is flawed and that the Administration's policy of `engagement' has not moved China toward free trade practices. 
China claims that wheat from our region is inflicted with a disease called TCK smut. At the bipartisan request of many Senators from the Pacific Northwest, the President was asked to discuss this bogus phytosanitary concern with Chinese President Jiang Zemin. The President personally met with President Zemin twice in the last two years, but the Pacific Northwest wheat industry remains locked out of another potential, enormous market. 
As a border state of Canada, Washington has encountered many trade discrepancies with our Northern counterparts. The beef trade between Washington and Canada has evoked bad feelings and more recently tensions escalated. Just two days ago, United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman announced their intention to begin intensive negotiations to resolve some of the restrictive trade practices utilized by Canada. While I applaud the Administration for taking this action, it is unfortunate that it comes only after ranchers in bordering States began blockading Canadian farm shipments. Agriculture trade relations have been thorny with Canada for quite some time, and many believe that the Administration's inability to support and defend the U.S. beef and wheat industries in negotiations with Canada have left agriculture with the short end of the stick. We are consistently being out-witted by the Canadian trade negotiators and the farmers and ranchers in this country are expected to pick up the pieces. 
These are just a few of the Administration's trade policies which directly impact the bottom line of farmers in the State of Washington. While I recognize and empathize with the family farm at a time when cash flow is sparse, I do not support the President or the Administration in its threats to veto the Agriculture Appropriations bill because the disaster package is not to their liking. 
There are several items that in addition to this disaster package, AMTA payments, and LDP payments which deserve attention. While expansion of trade is of obvious importance to the State of Washington and is certainly a long-term goal, regulatory relief, tax relief, adequate funding for agriculture research, and deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed are immediate mechanisms to provide assistance to the family farm. Unfortunately, the vehicles providing this relief--the Interior appropriations bill and the House passed tax package--are also under the threat of a Presidential veto. 
Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill is a constructive piece of legislation that deserves our support. While the unfortunate politics of partisanship has appeared to weigh heavily on this legislation, I sincerely hope that the Administration would remember the family farm and the longevity of production agriculture in this country and sign the bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this year began in a way unprecedented during my years as a U.S. Senator. Just months after passing the balanced budget agreement of 1997, budget forecasters released projections that included the possibility of a budget surplus as early as 1999. By March, the Congressional Budget Office estimated an $8 billion surplus by the end of fiscal year 1998. 
I'll skip ahead a few months, because we all know that the surplus projections continued to grow. Last week, fiscal year 1998 came to an end with the President and Congress announcing a $70 billion budget surplus. 
In less than a year, the deficit-busting efforts started early in the 1980s and culminating in last year's balanced budget agreement reached the climax we have been waiting for since 1969--the first budget surplus in 30 years. 
All of this is very good news, everyone on Capitol Hill wants to take credit for it. Despite the euphoric attitude that has overcome the congressional budgeteers and appropriators, however, I want to sound a note of caution. 
This weekend, the Seattle Times published an editorial that sums up my hesitation to jump on the pig pile scrambling to spend the projected surplus on tax cuts, as advocated by a number of my colleagues, or new government programs, as suggested by the President and Democratic leadership. 
The editorial, aptly titled `Surplus? What Surplus?', reminds us all of a reality few are willing to face. 
In July, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the Federal Government will run a $63 billion surplus in 1998 if the Social Security trust fund is included in the budget calculations. We still are running a $41 billion deficit, however, if the surplus in the Social Security trust fund is excluded. 
The Federal Government will not run a surplus without the inclusion of the Social Security trust fund until 2002, when CBO expects a $1 billion surplus. By 2008, the surplus will rise to $64 billion, without including the Social Security trust fund. 
We are close, but we are not out of the woods yet. 
I remain deeply concerned about the future viability of Social Security. 
Social Security is a sacred contract between the Federal Government and seniors. We cannot and must not use the current surplus in the Social Security trust fund to offset deficit spending in other Government programs. Unfortunately, the President, among others in Government, has proposed to do precisely that. 
As Congress speeds toward the end of the 105th Congress, we must keep the future of the Social Security trust fund paramount in our deliberations. Some Members of Congress want to pass a tax cut package before the election, which will be funded by the projected surplus. 
The President--who urged us to `Save Social Security First' during his State of the Union Address in January--opposes tax cuts for the American people but has been pushing for $20 billion in so called emergency spending since September. He does not propose to offset this spending with cuts in other Government programs. In fact, by categorizing his spending requests as `emergencies,' he plans to spend a large part of the surplus he himself designated for saving Social Security in January. 
Frankly, I question the legitimacy of the `emergencies' identified by the President--the year 2000 computer problem, military responsibilities in Bosnia, and the decennial census. These so-called emergencies have been on the radar screen for years. Unfortunately, the President failed to place a priority on these challenges when he gave Congress his budget in February. 
Now we have several `emergencies' for which the President is willing to dip into the surplus he deemed sacred in January--a surplus that does not exist unless we tap into the Social Security trust fund. 
Allow me to discuss the trust fund for just a moment. Today the Social Security trust fund is running a surplus. But that is by design. When the baby boom generation begins retiring in just a few years, that surplus will be needed to ensure that Social Security can meet its obligations. 
I believe that all Government surpluses must be used to guarantee the stability of the Social Security system so that everyone relying on Social Security today, and everyone working and paying into the system today, will be able to count on Social Security without any cuts or increased taxes tomorrow. 
The President has said that he wants to save Social Security, but in fact his budget proposed to spend billions of dollars over and above the balanced budget agreement he signed a year ago. Now he wants more money for the so-called emergencies I described earlier. Every one of those dollars will inevitably come out of the surplus I am convinced we need to preserve for Social Security. That is wrong. 
We must use all of the Social Security and other future budget surpluses to make entirely certain that the current generation, and at least the next generation, have Social Security in its present form. 
I believe so strongly in this position, that in a July strategy meeting to discuss tax and budget issues my advice to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott was to `save Social Security first.' I believe now that that is exactly what we will do. 
We cannot play smoke and mirrors with the Social Security trust fund. 
At the beginning of September, I sent this chart, which you can see, Mr. President, to more than 300,000 seniors in Washington State. I have received thousands of responses over the last 3 weeks. 
This is a difference between a true deficit in our normal accounts and a surplus that is created simply by counting the Social Security surplus, with the 0 point, as I said earlier, not reached until in the year 2002. 
Margaret Collins of Kent wrote: `Keep Social Security money for Social Security only.' 
Alice Crawley of Seattle wrote: `I am 82 years old and I say they should use any available surplus, Social Security and otherwise to preserve and protect Social Security.' 
Mr. and Mrs. Bill Pennock of Redmond wrote: `The American people pay into Social Security believing the money will be there when they retire. Our generation depends on Social Security and we feel future generations will also need it. Please do not spend the fund on other government programs.' 
Wallace Wickland of Bothell wrote: `You people in Washington have got to keep your hands off Social Security. This is all some people have. Voting for Social Security will save your jobs!' 
Anna Green of Tacoma wrote: `We always voted for you, and I hope you think of our children and grandchildren to preserve and protect the Social Security for them.' 
Barbara Murphy of Tumwater wrote: `I'm in favor of using all the surplus to shore-up Social Security. I know House Republicans propose a tax refund for citizens, but let's wait on that.' 
My constituents support using all of the Social Security surplus and future budget surpluses to make entirely certain that the current generation and future generations are protected. Once Congress and the President agree to a plan that shores up Social Security for our children and grandchildren who will retire during the next century, I gladly will join my colleagues in providing tax relief for hard-working Americans. 
I want to make that point crystal clear. I am not opposed to tax relief. In fact, I'm all for across-the-board tax cuts that provide relief for middle class taxpayers. In fact, I have cosponsored two bills that reduce or eliminate tax penalties on married couples--a major component of the House-passed tax relief package. The taxpayers have contributed more than their fair share to the balanced budget for which we so desperately want to claim credit in Washington, D.C. 
Unfortunately, we have to eat the spinach on our plate before we eat dessert. We have one more challenge to face--one more hurdle to jump--before we can claim victory on balancing the budget and start returning their hard-earned dollars to taxpayers. Let's secure and protect the Social Security trust fund for current retirees and future generations first. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. My colleague from Washington is correct. In several cases work by the Corps or its contractors appears to have created new problems. In the case of the Coweeman River, over one mile of volcanic sediment that backed up in this tributary. Initially ignored, this sediment now poses a serious threat to the community of Kelso. The Corps is currently scheduled to initiate a two-year study of these hazards and levels of protection in fiscal year 2000. It makes sense to all concerned that these matters be addressed as soon as possible.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my constituents in the Pacific Northwest and the Members of this body know that I am not a fan of the current version of the Endangered Species Act, a law that has proven to be a failure not only for endangered species but also many rural communities and private property owners as well. In fact, I have spent much of my time as a U.S. Senator looking for ways to improve that law. The Endangered Species Act has inflicted grave harm on natural resource industries based in the Northwest with little to show in return, especially if we attempt to measure the law's success in bringing salmon back to Northwest rivers and streams. 
In fact, the Puget Sound region faces the possibility of more ESA listings over the next year. Local leaders in the Pacific Northwest looked to the Washington State congressional delegation during this year's appropriations process for funds to implement the salmon recovery plan personalized to respond to our unique needs in the Puget Sound region. I believe that we will be successful. The local scientists and leaders know that a creative plan that is supported by the communities surrounding the Puget Sound area will be the best chance we have to achieve success and avoid the heavy hand of the Endangered Species Act, a law implemented by D.C. bureaucrats with plans and standards that may not fit with the challenges and competing interests that must be balanced in the Northwest. 
As my constituents put all of their energies behind this last-ditch effort to avoid the crushing impact of yet another listing in the Pacific Northwest, another group has been using every tool at its disposal to avoid the implications of the Endangered Species Act on its activities. 
Puget Sound and Columbia River Indian tribes in Washington and Oregon are proclaiming themselves exempt from the constraints already imposed on their commercial fishing for salmon and steelhead by the Endangered Species Act. As a result of Clinton administration Executive and Secretarial orders, Pacific Northwest tribes believe they should be able to decide for themselves whether or not to restrain their commercial gillnetting activities, while at the same time nontribal commercial and sport fishers face the full impact of the Endangered Species Act in the form of extensive fishing closures. 
On June 5, 1997, the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior issued a joint Secretarial order declaring that Indian lands and activities are not subject to the same controls as Federal public lands and privately-owned lands when it comes to enforcement of the ESA. 
This Secretarial order, signed by Commerce Secretary William Daley and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, was the result of more than a year and a half of negotiations among Clinton administration, Federal Government agencies, and Indian tribes from across America. President Clinton's similar Executive order was signed on May 14, 1998. 
Mr. President, I am frustrated and dismayed. While I have identified many flaws in the D.C.-driven implementation of the Endangered Species Act, I also strongly believe this law will have no chance of success if the administration is allowed to decide certain segments of the population and certain interest groups are not bound by it. The Members of this body have heard me criticize the enormous amount of money spent without result by the Federal Government in an attempt to save species of Pacific Northwest salmon and steelhead. In fact, it is estimated that each endangered or threatened fish preserved in the Northwest may have cost tens of thousands of dollars, if we consider the amount of money spent on recovery efforts as compared with our level of success. We must get a better bang for our buck, and I don't see how we can improve the return from our investment unless everyone in the Northwest complies with the restrictions imposed by the Act. 
In response to the unilateral actions taken by the administration over the last 2 years, which I consider beyond the scope of Executive and bureaucratic authority, I included a provision in this and last year's Interior appropriations bills expressing the contrary intent of Congress. The Endangered Species Act, as written, should apply equally to all Americans. 
Before the negotiations that resulted in the Secretarial and Executive orders I mentioned, the Federal Government's position was that `ESA applies to Indian Country, period.' By the time negotiations were completed, however, the Clinton administration had capitulated to tribal demands that the tribes decide for themselves, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not to respond to the conservation principles of the ESA. 
How can the Endangered Species Act work unless tribal fisheries share equitably in the conservation burden? 
The Clinton administration is pursuing a policy of preferential treatment. Under this policy, the conservation burden falls mainly upon non-Indians. According to the orders released by the administration, restrictions on Indian harvest of endangered and threatened species, both on and off-reservation, can be considered only if `the conservation purpose of the restriction cannot be achieved by reasonable regulation of non-Indian activities' and `voluntary tribal measures aren't adequate' to achieve ESA goals 
It certainly wasn't Congress' intent when the Endangered Species Act was passed into law that any group of Americans would be exempted from its provisions or that one group should have to bear conservation burdens greater than another group. And Members of this body know that non-Indians certainly can't stave off the impact of the Endangered Species Act by pursuing `voluntary' recovery plans after a species has been declared threatened or endangered. 
The efforts of the administration to exempt tribes from the Endangered Species Act don't stop at Secretarial and Executive orders. The National Marine Fisheries Service recently issued a draft rule modifying existing tribal exemptions under the ESA. Not only will tribes be able to continue `ceremonial and subsistence' take of threatened or endangered species in tribal fisheries, the tribes also will be able to engage in `commercial' take of threatened species, such as chinook salmon and steelhead trout. 
Allowing a tribal commercial exemption from the ESA would dramatically reduce the likelihood of recovery for threatened or endangered salmon and steelhead species. Non-tribal commercial and sport fisheries for chinook and coho salmon have been significantly curtailed in Puget Sound and on the Columbia River, and it is likely that chinook harvesting could be shut down entirely by next year. Yet the tribes and administration proclaim the tribes have a treaty right to continue to fish as they always have, regardless of the conservation needs of the fish. 
This is very unfair and contrary to Supreme Court decisions. The tribes should bear an equal share of the conservation burden, just as they enjoy a 50-percent share of the harvest when fish numbers are plentiful and healthy. 
Harvest restrictions necessary under the terms of the ESA must be applied in an equitable manner that is fair and consistent for all user groups, tribal and nontribal, if we are to meet conservation goals and see recovery of endangered salmon and steelhead in our lifetimes. 
Just a few weeks ago, the tribes, with the support of the administration, attempted to take their circumvention of the Endangered Species Act one step further. Fortunately, U.S. District Judge, Malcom Marsh, in Portland, OR, denied the request of the Federal Government and five Pacific Northwest tribes to reopen the tribes' commercial harvest season for fall chinook salmon. This opening for the tribes, requested by the Clinton administration, would have taken place while all types of nontribal fisheries were closed. 
The States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho opposed the tribal fishery, noting that the Federal Government had issued no biological opinion on what effect the tribal fishery might have on `threatened' Snake River and Columbia steelhead. Judge Marsh agreed with the States' contention that National Marine Fisheries Service had failed to issue a biological opinion showing tribal gillnet fishing wouldn't harm steelhead stocks protected under the ESA. 
Judge Marsh made the following statement in his ruling: `While I am highly sensitive to the importance of the tribes' treaty fishing rights, I am also mindful of the fact that no one will be fishing if the resource is depleted to the point of extinction.' 
Instead of being concerned primarily with the long-term preservation of the listed steelhead, the Judge stated, `The Federal Government appears to be more concerned with what the tribes are willing to accept as reductions to their fall commercial harvest than they are with the needs of the listed species.' 
Judge Marsh concluded, in his ruling against the tribes and Federal Government: `Federal agencies may not circumvent the unambiguous statutory mandate of the ESA simply to avoid more difficult issues or to appease one interested party at the expense of the others. Regardless of the result, the process must comply with the law and I fine the proposal submitted to me [by the Clinton administration and the tribes] . . . fails in that respect.' 
Yet, the tribes contend that, despite Judge Marsh's ruling, they can keep fishing. All that State governments can do is ask the public not to buy the fish the tribes catch, since technically they would be fishing under the `ceremonial and subsistence' exemptions to ESA. 
As a practical matter, however, in this technological age of flash freezing and vacuum-packaging, it is impossible for the States meaningfully to enforce this prohibition on the commercial sale of endangered wild fish netted by the tribes in their `ceremonial and subsistence' fisheries. 
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the Clinton administration have embarked upon a policy doomed to produce more strife and fewer fish for future generations of Indians and non-Indians alike. 
The solution to this problem is to pass legislation I introduced in July: the Tribal Environmental Accountability Act (S. 2301). This bill prohibits a tribe from claiming sovereign immunity as a defense if a tribe is a defendant in a case brought to enforce a Federal environmental law, such as the ESA. This much-needed legislation would allow tribes to be sued to mandate compliance with Federal environmental laws to the same extent that State governments or private entities can be sued. If the administration is unwilling equally to enforce the mandates contained in the Endangered Species Act across all user groups, then other interest groups must have the opportunity to pursue enforcement of this law, no matter how flawed it may be, in the courts of the United States. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
the PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). the clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to engage the chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, in a brief colloquy. It has come to my attention that, due to some confusion regarding the funding of an on-going Section 1135 ecosystem restoration project of a similar name, the conference report to accompany the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill eliminated funding for the Duwamish and Green River Basin study. Would the chairman agree that neither the Committee nor the conferees are opposed to the ongoing Duwamish and Green River Basin study?

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it looks like the administration has just experienced a tardy but welcome revelation, Mr. President. After 6 years of coddling its rulers and selling out U.S. exporters, some in the administration are now beginning to realize that `engagement' has not moved China toward free trade but to greater protectionism. 
The $50 billion a year and growing bilateral United States trade deficit, the largest with any trading partner in the world but Japan, wasn't enough. The continued and egregious market access barriers to U.S. agricultural products weren't enough. The defiant stance against WTO negotiators wasn't enough. And the flagrant violation of the intellectual property rights of the American software and entertainment industries wasn't enough. 
But finally, China has pushed at least one member of the administration too far. The straw that broke the camel's back was China's decision to ban joint ventures in the telecommunications industry. In Beijing last Tuesday, David Aaron, Undersecretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, became the first American official in nearly a decade to speak openly about China's protectionist trade policy and to threaten retaliation. 
Aaron is quoted in last Wednesday's Wall Street Journal as saying of the long list of trade barriers erected against American imports in China, `The list keeps getting longer, and nothing gets struck off it.' He continues, `China is taking the trade relationship for granted. They want to export to us but not buy our products.' 
Yes; that is precisely what I have been arguing for 3 years. But an administration wedded to a policy of `engagement' with China no matter how unproductive refused to believe it until now. I cannot begin to express the sense of vindication I had when reading an article in last Wednesday's Washington Post that hinted at a new administration trade policy with China. Instead of continuing to hope that China's desire to join the community of free trading nations in the WTO would outweigh its protectionist tendencies, the administration is finally `threatening retribution in a much more concrete arena--the United States market . . .' 
All well and good, but a day late and a dollar short. While President Clinton dismissed those of us in the antiengagement camp as ignorant, antifree traders, while the administration allowed the Government of the People's Republic of China to walk all over the United States for 6 years, and while the United States trade deficit ballooned out of control, my home State of Washington suffered the consequences. 
Since 1972, China has refused to allow Pacific Northwest wheat into its market. This nontariff barrier erected against our wheat is based on a bogus phytosanitary concern with the spread of a wheat disease called TCK smut. For more than 20 years, the United States has presented Chinese officials with irrefutable scientific evidence which proves conclusively that there is absolutely no risk of introducing TCK smut into China. 
China's ban on Pacific Northwest wheat is in violation of international standards requiring that import barriers imposed in the name of food safety be based on sound science. But it is protectionism, not sound science, that serves as the basis for China's ban on Washington State wheat. 
For the past 3 years, I and several of my colleagues from the Pacific Northwest, have written to the President and Vice President to 
ask for assistance in tearing down this deplorable trade barrier. Our entreaties have been totally ignored, Mr. President, and the wheat farmers in my home State of Washington have suffered at the hands of the administration's weakness. 
Instead, the administration turned a blind eye to the wheat ban and hundreds of other Chinese protectionist policies, arguing all along that continuing to grant most-favored-nation trading status to China was the best and only way of improving our trade relationship with China. 
In addition, our apples are barred from Chinese markets. Our insurance firms can't do business in China. Our telecommunications equipment is barred. 
The Chinese are not stupid. In fact, one might argue that they are brilliant strategists, having convinced the United States to sit on its hands while China pillaged the United States market. That the President, the leader of the strongest nation in the world, rolled over and played dead in the face of Chinese threats is an embarrassment to the United States. He betrays the free people of Taiwan--who do buy our goods and services. But he will sell China what it will gladly purchase--our defense secrets. He allows our intellectual property to be stolen with impunity. 
The President knows that China is the world's largest emerging market. With a billion potential consumers for United States goods and an insatiable need for infrastructure improvements and technology, the Chinese market is among the most appealing in the world. In the fact of this prize, the administration simply caved in to the demands of China's dictators. 
What the administration has ignored until this week, is that the United States is China's most important market as well. In fact, the United States absorbs 30 percent of China's exports. And today, with the financial crisis having drastically decreased demand throughout Asia, the American market is even more important to China. 
In its rush to expand its economy and catch up with the rest of the world, China, since the late 1980's, has embarked on a full scale effort greatly to increase its overseas exports and thus to foster an economic boom within its own borders. Without the United States market, China's economic growth would come to a screeching halt. 
That is why, Mr. President, I have argued for 3 years that we should use the United States market as leverage in our trade disputes with China. But the administration refused to accept the logic of this strategy--until, that is, Secretary Aaron spoke so frankly in Beijing on Tuesday. I implore the administration, with its newfound wisdom, to take Aaron's advice and start tomorrow not just to threaten, but to impose retaliation against China unless it makes dramatic changes in its trade policy immediately. 
To make such threats without following through would be disastrous. The administration must act on its words and impose trade restrictions on China immediately unless it takes drastic steps to eliminate market access barriers to United States exports. 
The administration should start with the most egregious barrier of all, the ban on Pacific Northwest wheat. If, by next week, China has not succumbed to the irrefutable scientific evidence and allowed Pacific Northwest wheat into its market, the United States must take retaliatory action. If China won't let our wheat into its market, we shouldn't let China's textiles into our market. It is a simple solution, and it will work. China wants our markets. It won't risk losing them, even if the price is open markets to American goods and services.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my agreement with this amendment and also express my admiration for both the dedication and the persistence of the Senator from North Dakota. It is a quality in him I greatly admire. 
We did start from very, very different points of view on this subject. Mine emphasized to the greatest extent free market principles and a lack of interference, whenever possible, with business organizations; his, a deep concern, and an appropriate concern, for smaller cities in which the kind of competitive advantage that my major city, Seattle, clearly has are simply not present. 
From the beginning, I have thought that his goal was an appropriate one, to try to see to it that better service was provided his constituents, was proper public policy, and at the same time feared the constrictions that some elements of his amendment imposed. 
I think at this point we have something with which we can live temporarily. It is not all that the Senator from North Dakota wants. I don't know everything about this field myself. 
One element of this amendment will try to get us the most objective possible information about the nature of the problem and perhaps the best solutions. We will be back--even if this bill passes in its present form--we will be back with another FAA bill in 2 years, all of us with much more knowledge. 
So my tribute to the Senator from North Dakota for his dedication to a cause that is significant. I hope we have done it in a way that will not damage the competition among major airlines or minor airlines, and in a way that will be of some real benefit to his constituents and to many other people in cities across the country in similar areas. 
I approve of the amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Death on the High Seas Act was either passed or last amended some 70 years ago. It is an act relating to exactly that--death on the high seas--that sets out limitations on damages that can be recovered in fault-based actions for such deaths. 
Obviously, the absence of any change in those limitations can be said to be something of an anachronism at this point. The Death on the High Seas Act does not limit the dollar amount of actual economic damages that can be recovered. The Death on the High Seas Act applies equally to death over the seas or on the seas as a result of an aircraft accident. The rationale, of course, for that kind of limitation on damages is the vital importance to the people of this country, of the maritime transportation of goods and passengers, and the air transportation of goods and passengers over the seas of the world. 
The view, I am sure, of those who passed the act in the first place was that this was such an important part of our society, that it was so important to encourage the development of efficient, swift, and inexpensive transport of goods and passengers, that there should be certain limitations to legal actions resulting in deaths on the high seas. 
The bill to which the Senator from Pennsylvania refers was the subject of a hearing in the Commerce Committee. That bill was not reported favorably or at all by the committee. So some portion of it or all of it was originally posed as an amendment to this bill on the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, to which this subject is not clearly relevant. 
The proponents of S. 943 and of the original form of this amendment wanted to remove all limitations--both for noneconomic damages and for punitive damages--from any such actions. That seemed to me, and continues to seem to me, to be an inappropriate response. The necessity for transportation by air over seas remains absolute in the world in which we live, and to subject either aircraft manufacturers or airlines to unlimited amounts of noneconomic damages and to punitive damages would have a clearly negative impact on the design and maintenance of airliners and of the airlines that operate. 
Flight 800 is not a Ford Pinto. All airlines and all aircraft manufacturers, domestic and foreign, are required to meet extraordinarily strict safety standards imposed by the Government of the United States. After 2 or 3 years of study, the greatest experts in the world are not certain of the cause of that crash. They think they know, but if one thing is clear to the ordinary observer, the crash did not take place due to the negligence of the manufacturer or of TWA. 
Nevertheless, in the fault-based litigation field which afflicts the United States, there is little doubt that a number of juries by trial lawyers could be persuaded that negligence that no one could have determined in advance was, in fact, present, and these damages would thereby be unlimited. 
So as the Senator from Pennsylvania has so graciously pointed out, we have here a compromise. I think that it is appropriate that certain noneconomic damages be recoverable. I think they will be recoverable and will be recovered even though in the normal sense of the word `negligence' against any of the defendants, it will never actually be proven. But I do not think that they should be unlimited. I do not think that cases like this admit to punitive damages under any conceivable set of circumstances. 
What this bill does is two things: It allows the recovery of certain noneconomic damages for the loss of care, comfort, and companionship of those who were killed in the aircraft crash to which this bill is retroactively applicable, and in future aircraft accidents, up to the amount of actual economic damages or $750,000--whichever figure is larger. I believe that is a generous award and a generous limitation for aircraft accidents. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania feels they should be unlimited, and he represents a strongly held point of view held by a large number of other Members of this body. But this is a legislative compromise. These damage limitations are far greater than they are under present law. They are far less than the American Trial Lawyers Association would like. 
It does seem to me that in a body that has struggled with product liability legislation for the better part of two decades, and which includes a majority of Members who feel that certain limits should be placed on product liability litigation, 
but whose goals have been frustrated through filibusters and the like, that to add another field to the kind of unlimited litigation that so plagues society at the present time and has so troubled debates in this body, not just over product liability but over medical malpractice as well, that such an extension would be highly unwise. 
As a consequence, the Senator from Pennsylvania and I disagree on the general philosophy of the vehicle with which we are involved here. But I think that, in the best traditions of the Senate, our disagreements have been resolved, at least for the time being, by a compromise--a compromise that has limits --limits that I think are perhaps too high on the kind of damages that can be recovered and implicitly as to whether they should be recovered at all under the circumstances, and the belief of the Senator from Pennsylvania that standard negligence rules ought to apply here as they do in many other areas. 
We have reached compromise on this. He has proposed an amendment which he doesn't completely agree with himself, but he thinks it represents an improvement. And I agree with an amendment that I do not completely disagree with and one I think is relatively too generous. It may well be that the Senator from Arizona thinks this will be the last amendment on this bill and we will move forward from here. I guess we can say that at some future time there will be another contest during which we can examine the premises of our fault-based system of liability and its relationship to aircraft accidents at greater length and at more leisure. 
For the time being, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the other Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who first brought this to my attention, and the many others who worked very hard to reach an accommodation. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania has done a very good job on a cause in which he believes, even though he didn't get everything he wanted. 
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, few of my colleagues would dispute the notion that capitalism is the foundation of America's economic success. Under capitalism, competition inspires innovation. Innovation led in the 19th Century to the industrial revolution, and in the 20th Century to the digital age. These developments have made the United States the richest, most successful nation in the world. But this Administration seems to distrust our capitalist, competitive system and wants to replace it with some sort of `third-way' in which government bureaucrats make major decisions about what innovations will be allowed in our economic system, and when. 
I refer particularly, Mr. President, to the Justice Department's vendetta against Microsoft, a company that has had the ingenuity and determination to achieve the American dream. Against the odds, one man with a good idea turned a workshop in his garage into the most successful high technology company in the world. The Administration is now on a path to destroy not only the man and his company but to destroy the dream as well. 
Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, has declare war on success in the name of antitrust law. According to Joel Klein's world view, it is the duty of the United States government to protect not the consumer but the company that cannot compete on its own merits. 
Mr. Klein has made his ambition abundantly clear. When he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in June he said, `We reject categorically the notion that markets will self-correct and we should sit back and watch.' Instead, Mr. Klein believes the government should control every move of America's most successful and innovative companies. 
What candidate for president ran on this platform? The American people were not informed that free markets were to be abandoned as our principal economic guide. Instead of allowing the best man, or in this case the best company, to win, the Justice Department wants to control the market and dole out slices of it to companies of its choice. 
This is anathema to the free market, Mr. President. 
The Department's case, after all, is merely an attempt to give Netscape and other Microsoft rivals a leg up in the ongoing battle for market share in the software industry. Microsoft has earned its current prominence in the software industry through hard work, innovation, and consumer choice. The company has been successful because it has had better ideas and more efficient means of turning those ideas into superior products. Consumers in the United States and throughout the world simply prefer Microsoft products. 
But jealous rivals who have not reached the same level of success have now enlisted the Justice Department to give them what they and the Administration believe is rightfully theirs--more market share. These rivals, I fear, may soon regret ever having opened this Pandora's box. For a precedent may have already been set. That precedent is that government intervention in the market, in the absence of consumer complaint or dissatisfaction, is acceptable. 
That is why I speak here today, Mr. President, as one in a growing number of voices in America in firm opposition to the Administration's case against Microsoft. 
As I see it, the Administration is not working for the greater good, but for its own good. Those at the highest levels of this Administration believe they, not the market and certainly not consumers, know what is best for the nation. Rick Rule, former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust under President Ronald Reagan, summed it up best when he said, `The Hubris reflected in the government's case against Microsoft is monumental.' 
This is just the beginning, Mr. President. Yesterday, at the Upside Conference, a meeting of high-tech industry leaders here in Washington, Roberta Katz, General Counsel for Netscape, said of the government's case against Microsoft, `This is about a lot more than just Microsoft.' To Ms. Katz I say, be careful what you wish for, be very careful what you wish for. Today the government's target is Microsoft, but tomorrow, it could very well be Netscape. 
The Antitrust Division, in filing its case against Microsoft, is working to justify an expanded role for government in the high-tech industry. The further its tentacles are allowed to reach into high-tech market, the tighter its grip on the industry will become. 
In fact, at a hearing tomorrow before Judge Jackson, the Justice Department will request that it be allowed to expand the scope of its case against Microsoft. There are two explanations for the Justice Department's motives; both are troubling. The first is that the Antitrust division is seeking to increase the aspects of the high-tech industry over which it will gain control if it wins the case. The second is that the Division is becoming increasingly desperate to find an issue, any issue, on which is can prevail in court. 
The first point should be of no little concern to Ms. Katz of Netscape and her counterparts at all the other high-tech companies cheering the Justice Department on. But it is the second point on which I would like to expand. 
The Antitrust Division knows that its case against Microsoft is literally falling apart at the seams. As my colleagues will recall, on June 23 a three judge United States Appeals Court panel overturned the preliminary injunction issued against Microsoft last December. The heart of the injunction, and the heart of the Department's current case against Microsoft, is the company's decision to integrate its web browser into its Windows operating system. 
As soon as the Appeals Court ruled that the integration of browser technology into Windows as not a violation of U.S. antitrust law, Joel Klein started scrambling frantically for other claims to make against Microsoft. If the Administration's concern was truly that Microsoft was acting illegally in integrating products into Windows, the Justice Department would have and should have dismissed its case then and there. But it didn't. 
Joel Klein continued attempts to drag more and more issues into the case is telling, Mr. President. Those attempts are a clear sign that the government's real beef with Microsoft is its size. The government can't stand the fact that Microsoft is successful. Microsoft, in the eyes of the Administration, is just too big. So the Justice Department will do everything it can to paint Bill Gates as the bad guy. 
As Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. aptly described it in an editorial in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, Joel Klein `has spraypainted the world with subpoenas, calling companies to testify about every failed and not-yet-failed collaboration between competitive allies and allied competitors in the computer industry.' 
the strategy, according to Rick Rule, is `the old plaintiff's trick of throwing up lots of snippets of dialogue that try to tar the defendant as a bad guy.' 
Aside from all the legal commentary, the real issue, Mr. President, is that the Justice Department's case against Microsoft is a bad one. Joel Klein knows it, the high-tech community knows it, and I know it. 
No legal wrangling can disguise the fact that what the Administration is doing is wrong. It is not only wrong in the sense that the Justice Department will probably lose in the end. But it is wrong in the sense that the very premise on which it stands is at fundamental odds with the free market capitalism that has made this nation great.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in recent years, I have become increasingly frustrated with the inability of the Forest Service to complete work on several small hydroelectric projects located on the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest in my State. The Service's inability to make important decisions on these renewable energy resources is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the President's Northwest Forest Plan (`ROD') which has stopped these projects from going forward. 
The President's Northwest Forest Plan states clearly that multipurpose uses of the federal forests are not precluded, and that the plan must follow existing law applying to such uses. Yet, since its adoption in 1994, the Forest Service has and continues to paralyze the development of small hydroelectric projects by ignoring laws applying to multipurpose. This inaction has delayed and stifled review of such projects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--the agency responsible for issuing federal licenses for hydroelectric projects. 
Forest Service interpretation of the ROD intrudes directly on the ability of the Commission to perform its hydroelectric licensing function of balancing development and nondevelopment issues. Both the Commission, when determining consistency with the purpose of a national forest under Section 4(e) of the Act, and the Forest Service, when determining whether to issue a special use permit, must apply existing law fairly. Forest Service inaction on pending projects (some of which have been under review for over a decade) prevents FERC from completing its licensing responsibilities. 
In terms of federal forest management, the six small hydroelectric projects proposed for the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest are virtually inconsequential. All are located well above areas affecting anadromous fish, and would occupy a total of 10 to 40 acres each, with most of the sites being untouched except for the portions needed for project facilities. Adverse impacts to fish, wildlife or other environmental resources are subject to mitigation by FERC and the Forest Service. 
Project proponents in my state have spent millions of dollars to secure approval of six projects located in the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest, including project design and environmental analysis necessary to gain approval from the Forest Service and FERC. In spite of the fact that the 1994 ROD instructs the Forest Service to use `transition' provisions to approve pending projects, it has not done so, and continues to add project review requirements not allowed by the ROD or existing law. As a result, the Forest Service is stopping FERC from making timely licensing decisions on these projects. Shifting standards of review an delay by the Forest Service have deprived project proponents of their right to rely upon clear standards for project approval before expending funds in reliance on such standards. 
Many aspects of these projects were found to be in compliance with prior forest regulations and other environmental laws, and are being subjected to duplicative and inconsistent review. Provisions of the ROD developed for application to extremely large-scale timber harvest are not meant to impact small-scale hydroelectric projects. Timber 
management regulations are totally disproportionate with the scale of any potential environmental impacts of small-scale hydroelectric facilities. In fact, the ROD itself explicitly recognizes that uses other than timber harvest do not require the same level of restrictions. 
The Forest Service continues to use the ROD as a reason for imposing new study requirements, increasing mitigation demands, and ignoring agreements on project compliance with forest plan standards and FERC requirements. Each new requirement adds onerous financial burdens on project proponents, delays project approval, and undermines the regulatory need for an end to project review so a final licensing decision can be made by FERC. 
Actions by the Forest Service have placed that agency in direct conflict with FERC, a result not intended by the ROD. FERC's jurisdiction over hydroelectric project licensing is unaltered by the ROD, which itself calls for increased interagency cooperation, not confrontation. 
Mr. President, I have tried in recent years through my position as Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for funding the Forest Service's annual budget to get some answers from this agency as to why it was holding up these hydroelectric projects. In 1995, I inserted language directing the Forest Service to `conduct an expeditious review' of projects covered by the ROD. In subsequent hearings, I have continued to ask agency witnesses for a status report. To date, none of the responses from the Forest Service have satisfied my concerns or adequately addressed this issue. 
For this reason, I am introducing legislation today that would expedite the hydroelectric project review process. It will require the Forest Service to convey to permit holders and license applicants for these projects at fair market value the parcels of land necessary for development of these projects. While I would prefer and am still hopeful that this issue can be resolved in negotiations between the project proponents and the agency, clearly this process is broken and needs to be fixed. This legislation should serve as a catalyst for resolving outstanding hydroelectric project review issues. Project proponents deserve at least that much.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year, Congress and the President agreed to provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an incentive to states to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To receive this money, states must expand eligibility levels to children living in families with incomes up to 200% of the federal poverty level. 
Washington State has a strong record of ensuring that its low-income kids have access to health care. Four year ago, my state decided to do what Congress and the President have just last year required other states to do. In 1994, Washington expanded its child Medicaid eligibility level to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) all the way through to the age of 18. 
During the negotiations of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (BBA), Congress and the Administration recognized that certain states were already undertaking Medicaid expansions up to or above 200 percent of FPL, and that they should be allowed to use the new SCHIP funds. Unfortunately, this provision was limited to those states that enacted expansions on or after March 31, 1997 and disallowed Washington from accessing the $230 million in SCHIP funds it had been allocated through 2002. As a result, Washington State cannot use its SCHIP allotment to cover the 90,000 children currently eligible, but not covered for health care at or below 200 percent of poverty. Exacerbating this inequity is the fact that many states have begun accessing their SCHIP allotments to cover kids at poverty levels far below Washington's current or past eligibility levels. 
The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Murray, corrects this technicality and is a top priority for the Washington State delegation as we near the end of the 105th Congress. Congresswoman Dunn has also introduced a companion measure in the House of Representatives that is cosponsored by the entire Washington delegation. 
This bipartisan, bicameral initiative represents a thoughtful, carefully-crafted response to the unintended consequences of SCHIP and brings much-needed assistance to children currently at-risk. Rather than simply changing the effective date included in the BBA, this initiative includes strong maintenance of effort language as well as incentives for our state to find those 90,000 uninsured kids because we feel strongly that they receive the health coverage for which they are eligible. 
This bill does not take money from other states nor does it provide additional federal subsidies for children the state is now covering, it simply allows Washington to continue to do the good work they have already started by focusing on new, uninsured children at low income levels first.

Mr. GORTON. I have been in the Chamber through most of this debate as I am the manager of the bill under discussion now. I believe that I am the only one, at least on this side of the issue, who has no immediate constituent interest in the subject. But I do have certain observations from listening to the debate on the part of others. 
The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, mentioned at one point that the Minerals Management Service had said that this was a revenue-neutral proposal, although in fact it seems not to be that case. The proponents of this amendment emphasize that there is a lot of money involved here for schools and for parks and for other purposes. 
It occurs to me that if this is a debate over revenues to the Federal Government, we are in effect talking about a tax, a tax on certain companies engaged in the oil business. And if we are speaking about a tax, it seems to me we ought to be deciding that question here in the Congress of the United States. Under our Constitution, taxes are not levied by regulatory agencies of the Government. They are determined and they are levied by the Congress. 
If, in fact, this amendment will produce tens of millions of dollars for various governmental purposes, then it is inevitable that someone is going to pay for those purposes. One of two things is going to happen, it seems to me. And one of my colleagues can correct me if I am wrong. Either it will be reflected in the price of gasoline and other petroleum products that every consumer in the United States pays and will be in effect an increase in the gas tax, or if these companies can simply import more and produce less domestically, it will simply drive American producers out of business because their cost of business will be increased. 
But one of those two consequences seems to me to be inevitable. Either this is going to be a tax on the American people by increasing the cost of their gasoline, or it is going to increase our dependence on foreign oil and drive American producers out of business. I think that conclusion is absolutely inevitable. I think that is a policy decision that should be made by the Congress of the United States and not by an obscure Federal agency, and for that reason I oppose the amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I know of no one else desiring to speak on this Enzi proposal. It seems to me that it is a relatively simple one. It simply enjoins for one additional year the right of the Secretary of the Interior to avoid the requirements of both the 11th amendment and of present law by making it a determination that a State has not engaged in good faith in negotiating a class III gambling compact and that it has stated its sovereign immunity in an action by an Indian tribe or another kind against it. 
In light of the fact that the report of a long-term commission on the effect of gambling in the United States has not yet been made, it seems to me that this is a reasonable amendment. I know of no request for a rollcall vote on the amendment. 
Mr. President, I believe we are ready to vote on the Enzi amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from Massachusetts. I am going to use very little of this time and will allow him to speak on it. 
Mr. President, the eloquent and thoughtful Senator from Missouri has raised two specific criticisms of the continuation of funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. One relates to a notorious anti-Christian play called `Corpus Christi' about to be produced in New York City, the sponsor of which originally received the tentative NEA award on the basis of an application described by the Senator from Missouri. 
Personally, I think the NEA should probably have turned down that application at the time at which it was granted on the ground that it sounded as though the play was on no subject other than a very standard and Orthodox Christian theme which is perhaps inappropriate for funding by government. 
In any event, the National Endowment for the Arts has not funded the production of that play, might well have decided that it did not wish to subsidize anything else that the theater was doing, but certainly has not breached any of the requirements which Congress has laid down for the National Endowment for the Arts itself. Had it gone ahead knowing what the play was about, we might be having quite a much longer debate here today and one in which the future of the National Endowment for the Arts might be very seriously under threat, including, from among others, this Senator. 
Secondly, the Senator from Missouri quite accurately describes the decision of the Supreme Court on the decency standards included in former and current versions of the funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. I say, joining myself with the Senator from Missouri as a former State attorney general, that I was somewhat disappointed in that Supreme Court decision which largely ducked the fundamental issues that were involved in the limitations Congress has placed on the way in which the National Endowment for the Arts can make its grants. 
The Supreme Court at least nominally upheld those decency provisions but raised some very serious questions about their future applicability under future challenges. The bottom line was, however, that the National Endowment for the Arts, that had refused to fund certain activities by Ms. Finley, among others, was upheld in that refusal. 
As long as the courts continue to uphold the National Endowment when it engages in that kind of rejection, I think we will be in good shape. If at some time in the future the Supreme Court should say that this Congress does not have the ability to provide limitations on the use of this money to enforce commonly held decency standards in the United States, we will be debating a different issue. But at the present time we are debating the issue of the continuation of the National Endowment for the Arts under the rules under which it has operated for the last couple of years, during which it has not funded grants that outraged a significant majority or even a very large minority of the American people. 
The great bulk of the grants--or rather most of the money that the National Endowment for the Arts uses--goes to State art agencies. Most of the rest goes to institutional kinds of activities--symphony orchestras, art museums and the like. The restrictions on the NEA funding of individual projects are very, very significant and have prevented the kind of controversies that took place 5 or 6 years ago. 
In other words, Mr. President, it is my view that the reforms that have been imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts by the Congress of the United States have, in fact, worked, and the grants made by the National Endowment for the Arts help the arts scene all across the country, which are far more decentralized than they were before, in far more underserved areas, in far more deserving entities in small towns and small cities around the United States. 
On balance, it seems to me highly appropriate to continue the modest support that Congress gives for the NEA imprimatur. And almost all of our constituents involved in the arts tell us that even a tiny grant from the National Endowment provides for the arts and entities that get the great bulk of their money from charitable contributions, from generous-minded people in their own communities. I attended an opening of a new concert hall in Seattle on Sunday in which perhaps $100 million or more was spent for the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, an occasional minor recipient of grants from the NEA. That fund drive was greatly strengthened by the kind of support that the NEA gives. It is almost solely financed by State government, county government, local government contributions, and even larger contributions from the private sector itself. 
The NEA, for better or worse, is a catalyst for arts support, private and public, all across the United States, and the endowment should be continued.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we began debate on this Interior appropriations bill last Tuesday. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and I each made our opening statements and a handful of agreed-upon amendments were added to the bill at that point. 
Then we spent much of the rest of the week on an amendment relating to campaign finance laws and other subjects not related to the Interior appropriations bill. So no progress was made on this bill. 
Today, a number of Members on the other side of the aisle wish to offer an amendment related to agricultural policy. Of course, under the rules of the Senate, they have every right to do so. It is certainly appropriate to recognize them in the absence of a contested amendment dealing with the Interior appropriations bill. 
The majority leader wants all Members to know that there will be time for discussion of that amendment during the course of the afternoon on both sides, including the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Agriculture. But when that debate seems to be over, or at 5 o'clock, whichever comes first, the Senator from Indiana, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, will move to table the amendment and will ask for the yeas and nays, and there will be a vote on tabling the amendment immediately after the vote that is already scheduled for 5:30 this afternoon. 
With that notification, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, it was a week ago tomorrow early in the afternoon that the Senate began consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, and I made our opening statements. We passed a handful of agreed amendments, and since then the entire subject matter has dealt with matters totally extraneous to that Interior appropriations bill. According to the minority leader's action, we will have another such extraneous amendment tomorrow. But in the closing of this evening, I do have this set of amendments, all of which relate to the subject of the bill. 
The first is by Senator Campbell on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which strikes certain language in the bill on the subject of the use of highway trust funds. 
The second, of which I am a sponsor, also on behalf of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, is an amendment to the Tribal Self-Governance Act to require the repayment of misused Federal funds by self-governance tribes. 
The third one of mine is a minor boundary modification at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area. 
The fourth also is one of mine for the Fish and Wildlife Service which prohibits the use of funds for land acquisition at Texas Chenier Plain. 
The fifth, by Senator Hollings, to which the colloquy applies, makes amendments to the Coastal Barrier Resource System maps in South Carolina. 
The sixth, by the two Senators from Maryland, is a modification of section 135 of the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill on the subject of the Oxon Cove land exchange. 
The next is by Senator Stevens which clarifies section 121, re: `hotshot' crews--that is to say, forest firefighting crews--in Alaska. 
The next, also by Senator Stevens, provides for exchange of lands in Katmai National Park. 
And, the last by Senator Wyden of Oregon gives the Bureau of Land Management authority to enter into the watershed restoration and enhancement agreements to the same extent that the Forest Service can do so. 
With that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be agreed to.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to introduce legislation which will correct a longstanding technical error to the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986. 
As those who were around this body over a decade ago remember, the Columbia Gorge Act was a highly complicated and contentious piece of legislation. A great number of impacted citizens made substantial sacrifices to see that this Act which was intended to protect one of the most pristine and magnificent natural resources anywhere in America could become law. Because of the detailed nature and the sometimes convoluted process established under this Act, it is not surprising that a mistake along the lines of what my bill today intends to correct could happen. My legislation simply makes a technical correction to the Gorge Act by excluding approximately 29 acres of land owned by the Port of Camas-Washougal. This area was inadvertently included within the southwestern boundary of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area 12 years ago. 
Mr. President, ever since the establishment of the National Scenic Area, the Port of Camas-Washougal has been diligent in its efforts to prove that a small portion of its property was unintentionally included in the Scenic Area. In fact, even before the Gorge Act became law, the Port was successful in getting legislation passed that established the Steigerwald Lake National Wildlife Refuge and reserved 80 acres of this area for its own purposes. 
Unfortunately, two years later, Congress in its infinite wisdom located the southwest 
boundary of the Columbia Gorge National Scenic Area so that approximately 19 of the 80 reserved acres and 10 acres of Port-owned land were included in the National Scenic Area. The legislation I am offering today would exclude these 29 acres under question as Congress had originally intended. 
I touched earlier on the Port's diligence in seeing this process through to its completion. Whether it be working with the Washington State Congressional delegation, getting approval from the Columbia Gorge Commission, or convincing originally skeptical segments of the local community, the Port's efforts are proof positive that persistence pays off when it comes to resolving complicated and contentious problems. It also helps to have the facts on your side. And clearly that is what the Port has been demonstrating over the past 12 years. 
One concern that was raised in discussions with representatives of a number of interested parties throughout the local southwestern Washington community was the possibility that legislation making a technical boundary change might set a dangerous precedent in which other less deserving boundary change proposals are cavalierly enacted into law. Because of these concerns, I have included a provision in my bill stating in no uncertain terms that is not the intent of this legislation to set a precedent regarding adjustment or amendment of any boundaries of the National Scenic Area or any other provisions of the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act. 
While the Gorge Act remains controversial within some sectors of my state and is by no means perfect, this legislation represents a special case where it has been clearly proven that the intent of Congress was not being carried out and the enabling statute needed correction. Any further proposals to change boundaries or revisions to the '86 Act will have to stand on their own merits and pass a similar test. 
In addition to the Port of Camas-Washougal, I also want to commend representatives of the Columbia Gorge Commission and the Friends of the Gorge for working together with the Port to develop a reasonable solution to this mistake. I also want to thank my two colleagues, Senator Murray and Congresswomen Smith, both of whom also have the pleasure of representing this beautiful area, for their support in this effort. While my legislation is not intended to set any legislative precedents, I do hope the positive process by which it was developed will foster further consensus building efforts throughout the local community.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, while we are on the Interior appropriations bill, the current amendment is the McCain-Feingold campaign financing amendment. Whether we will use all of the time of the Senate between now and the time for a vote on a motion for cloture on the amendment, I am not certain. 
However, it is very unlikely, I say to my colleagues, that we will debate contested amendments to the Interior appropriations bill before we have completed debate on McCain-Feingold. However, we are available to deal with amendments that can be worked out and agreed to which we will send up and deal with if there are any short spaces of time in which Members are not available to discuss the McCain-Feingold bill. Members who have interests in the Interior appropriations bill who have amendments that they think will be accepted or can be worked out should be in contact with me or with staff of the Appropriations Committee, and we will attempt to work them in whenever it is convenient to do so. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads in relevant part: 
Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. 
No law, Mr. President, and I pick up this relatively long and detailed proposal for a new law, and I read the title of one of the sections, the title appearing on page 16: `Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements for Electioneering Communications.' Let me read that once again, Mr. President. Section 200B of this bill is a `Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements for Electioneering Communications.' 
Now, what is an electioneering communication? According to the bill, and again I quote, `electioneering communication means any broadcast from a television or radio broadcast station which refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office; is made or scheduled to be made within 60 days before a general, special, or runoff election for such Federal office.' 
Mr. President, I go back to the first amendment. The first amendment says: 
Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. 
It is impossible for me to see how the proponents of this legislation can claim that these detailed restrictions on what corporations or labor unions and within the body of the bill, individuals, political parties or organizations, can do when they are communicating about an election and so much as naming a political candidate. 
The American Civil Liberties Union, in writing about this provision in connection with last February's debate, wrote: 
This unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express advocacy simply because it refers to a Federal candidate who, more often than not, is a congressional incumbent during an election season. 
This argument doesn't even go to the desirability of such a provision but simply to the fact that it is clearly a violation of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
One can go beyond that and wonder why this phrase `electioneering communication' only applies to radio and television. I think at the time of our previous debate the definition was broader than that. But here we have a situation in which a particular form of communication about public issues--of speech about public issues--is banned but an identical speech about the same public issues using the same words is not banned or controlled in any respect whatsoever--radio and television; not newspapers, not handbills, not direct mail. I believe it is likely that these provisions would be found unconstitutional if only because of that distinction without a difference between forms of communication; that if one form of communication is allowed, how can you possibly prohibit another form of communication? 
The rationale, I believe, is that the sponsors of this provision believe that radio and television communication is somehow more effective than other forms of communication and so they will ban it only. But the fundamental position of the opponents to this bill is that this whole section, the whole subtitle dealing with independent and coordinated expenditures, dealing with what can and cannot be done within 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of the general election, clearly abridges the `freedom of speech' clause of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
In both Congress and the courts, there have been frequent appeals to certain limitations on certain forms of speech and the broadest definition of that word when that speech is asserted to be obscene. Much of that debate revolves around whether or not James Madison and the Founding Fathers would have protected certain forms of speech--obscenity, even advertising and the like. We debated that issue in connection with proposed tobacco legislation earlier this year. But clearly the draftsmen of the first amendment, the Founding Fathers, were absolutely certain and clear in their belief that political speech, the debate about political ideas, be absolutely free and unfettered. And they succeeded in doing just exactly that. 
In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court said: 
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. 
I may return to this issue in a few moments, but it does represent only one-half--one section of this bill. The other element of the bill, the prohibition of what is called `soft money,' probably is not subject to the same constitutional strictures. It is simply overwhelmingly undesirable. Congress, in 1974, in a portion of its campaign finance regulations passed 
in that year, limited the amount of money that one individual could give to another individual's political campaign for Federal office. That portion of the 1974 statute was found to be valid, though the limitations on actual expenditures by a given candidate from that candidate's own money or from other sources was found to be invalid, under the Constitution, for the very reasons that I have just read, from the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v. Valeo. 
What has been the inevitable result of those restrictions? What has been the inevitable result of those restrictions as the limitations passed in 1974 have shrunk by the operation of inflation in our society so that the $1,000 per individual per campaign limitation in 1974 is worth roughly $380 or $390 today? Mr. President, the response on the part of people who feel strongly about political ideas and about political campaigns has been to cause them to switch a great deal of their support from individual candidates to the political parties under whose aegis those candidates run for office. 
Now, I think that this is, at least, a modest step in the wrong direction. Why? Because, of course, every dollar spent by a candidate--whether that candidate has written a check out of his or her own pocket or whether or not that money has been solicited from others--every dollar spent by an individual candidate on a communication is subject to criticism from the newspapers, television stations, and from other candidates to exactly the extent that it is deceptive or dodges the perceived real issues in a political campaign. Each candidate, in other words, can be held responsible, and candidates are generally held responsible, for the quality of their own communications. A candidate, however, cannot nearly so easily be held responsible for communications coming from that candidate's party. So to exactly the extent that we have limited--have choked off the ability of candidates other than the wealthiest of those candidates to raise--

Mr. GORTON. He does, though in this case I am not sure that Buckley v. Valeo would have been so decided, even with respect to the limitation on contributions to individual candidates, had those limitations been, say, $380 or $390 today. That is to say, a restriction or a limitation that is constitutional under one set of circumstances could easily find itself to be unconstitutional under another set of circumstances, if the Court deemed those limitations to be unreasonably restrictive.

Mr. GORTON. The point the Senator from Washington was making was simply this, Mr. President: That limitations, constitutional as they may be, on the ability of candidates, other than those who can finance their own campaigns, to solicit money from others, has forced that money into a channel in which the electioneering communications are far less the responsibility of the individual candidate than they are when that candidate spends for himself. 
From a public policy point of view, it is the view of this Senator at least that money spent by political parties is less desirable because there is less responsibility for it than money spent by individual candidates. But of course those aren't the only two alternatives for spending money for political purposes. 
As and when these limitations on contributions to political parties become law, to the extent they are found constitutional, the interest of those who feel a vital necessity to communicate political ideas to advance causes of either ideas or for candidates is not going to be eliminated, it is not even going to be diminished. 
What do we have under those circumstances, Mr. President? Under those circumstances, we have the individual who can no longer give a significant amount of money to a candidate of his or her choice, can no longer give what he or she considers a sufficient amount to the political party of that candidate engaged in one or two other political activities: Either in independent expenditures on behalf of an individual candidate or an idea or in issue advocacy. Under those circumstances, the communications are even less the responsibility of the candidate who benefits from them than they are when the money is spent by that candidate's political party. 
The political party is not responsible for the content of any such electioneering communications either, but we then get to the very unconstitutional limitations on express advocacy that are included in this bill. The sponsors of the bill run up against the fact that the limitations that they can impose constitutionally simply force money used on politics into areas that they cannot constitutionally touch because the Constitution says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech. 
The amount of money spent on political ideas and political advocacy is no less--in fact, in many respects it may be 
more--it is simply that it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to criticize a candidate for money that is, for all practical purposes, being spent on behalf of that candidate. 
That, Mr. President, is the fundamental reason that even those portions of this bill which are arguably constitutional are highly undesirable. They will not lessen the amount of money spent during the course of political campaigns. They will make the spending of that money less responsible than it is at the present time. They have nothing to do with an argument about corruption, other than to encourage the kind of subterfuge which so marked the 1996 elections. 
If, for example, the money spent in 1996 could have been legally given directly to the candidates and disclosed at the time, we wouldn't be in the midst of one more search for an independent counsel to examine the results of those elections. 
The net results of this bill, it seems to me, are twofold: They are to force political money into less and less responsible channels in which disclosure is less than it is at the present time and, to the extent that they attempt to control those expenditures, to come afoul of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. No, Mr. President, we would be far, far better off in encouraging, rather than discouraging, contributions directly to candidates and requiring their immediate disclosure, and in encouraging rather than discouraging support of our political parties. 
Most of us who are engaged in partisan politics through most of our careers have been exposed to the academic proposition, at least, that one of the shortcomings of the American political system, in comparison with the parliamentary systems of most other democracies, is the almost total absence of party discipline and party responsibility. We are often criticized for the fact that each one of us as an individual--that a voter cannot be at all certain when he or she votes for a candidate of the Republican Party, or the Democratic Party, for that matter, that they will get what they believe to be the platform of that political party adopted, because the candidates, in each case, are independent agents. 
Most academics would ask us to increase the power, the degree of influence, of political parties over their members, especially over their elected officials, so that we could have a brighter line of distinction between the parties and their platforms, so that voters would have what they consider to be a more significant choice. 
I may say that I don't necessarily buy that argument. I am not sure I buy it at all. But there are few arguments put forward by either academics or, I think, by practicing politicians that political party organizations of the United States should be weaker and of less account than they are today. 
This bill, to the extent that it is constitutional, weakens, marginalizes, almost eliminates, the effect of political party organizations, and it does so to exactly the extent that it increases the authority and the influence of nonparty organizations of the most narrow of special interest organizations in political campaigns. 
No, Mr. President, we should strengthen the candidates' organizations. We should require candidates to be more responsible for the money that is spent on their behalf, and we should probably be strengthening political party organizations at the same time. 
What we do in this bill is to continue the weakening of the candidates, to add to that the weakening of the parties, and we encourage, because of the unconstitutional nature of the second part of this bill, the portion of spending in our political system for which the spenders and the political parties and the candidates are least accountable. 
This bill is no better than it was in February when it was defeated. It is no better than it was nearly 2 years ago when it was defeated. 
The comments during the course of the debate a year ago last fall from George Will are as applicable today as they were then. And I will conclude by quoting him: 
Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus `speech codes,' nor the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism, or the 1920s `red scare,' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' advancing under the protective coloration of political hygiene. 
That was true last year. It is true this year. It will be true next year. It is the fundamental reason that this bill violating first amendment rights of free speech should be rejected by this body once again.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, these are primarily a set of rather small and technical amendments. The first one, for Senator Craig, strikes section 333 regarding recreation residence fees and modifies section 343 of last year's bill on that subject. It is more modest than the section 333 that it strikes. 
The second amendment by the distinguished occupant of the Chair subjects certain reserved mineral interests to the Mineral Leasing Act. 
The next set of amendments, all of which carry my name, are a technical fix to section 332 on prescribed burning operations; a technical amendment to section 328 on the authority given to the Forest Service to acquire independently a general ledger system; a technical change to section 339 on the prohibition of the use of timber purchaser road credits; a technical change to section 331 on Forest Service regulations on the use of fixed climbing anchors; a technical change on the financial statements from the Office of Special Trustee, this at the administration's request; a technical correction on reprogramming procedures; an amendment to the BIA language relating to other tribes taking land into trust from within the boundaries of the original Cherokee territory; a proposal by Senator Reid on the BLM modifying section 125 to correct and clarify the legal description of lands to be conveyed; and one of my own relating to the Forest Service, a technical correction regarding accounting for indirect expenses. 
As I said, Mr. President, these tend to perfect sections that are included in the bill and under my unanimous consent request will be subject to further amendment if any Member desires to do so just as if they were a part of the original bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to bring before the Senate the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The bill provides $13.4 billion in discretionary budget authority for agencies and programs under the subcommittee's jurisdiction, an increase of $265 million above the FY 98 freeze level, but $660 million less than the President's budget request. 
As always, putting this bill together has been a great challenge. The subcommittee received more than 2,000 individual requests from Senators regarding particular projects or programs, the majority of which were requests for additions to the President's budget request, which I have already mentioned is well in excess of the amounts available to the Subcommittee. While Senator Stevens has been as generous with the Interior Subcommittee as I could reasonably expect him to be given the constraints of the discretionary spending caps, the subcommittee's allocation is such that the FY 1999 bill in large part continues programs at or near the current year level. There are significant, but modest, increases for a handful of high priority programs, but for the most part there are few surprises or dramatic new funding initiatives. 
As Members consider whether particular programs in this bill have been treated fairly within the constraints of the subcommittee's allocation, I hope they will consider two factors. First, for the first time since Fiscal Year 1995, this bill does not mandate a sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay for the costs of operating the reserve. An oil sale at current price levels would be unwise to say the least. But the fact that this bill does not include an oil sale means that the Subcommittee had to find $155 million for operation of the Reserve that was not included in last year's base. As a consequence, the increase in the Subcommittee's allocation is effectively only $110 million above the freeze level. 
The second factor of which I want my colleagues to be aware when evaluating this bill is the impact of increases in Federal pay, benefits and other fixed costs. The Interior bill as a whole is one of the most personnel-intensive of the appropriations bills, supporting tens of thousands of park rangers, foresters, Indian health professionals and other Federal workers. Each year the agencies funded in this bill must accommodate increases in pay and benefits for these workers, and similar cost increases over which the Subcommittee has no direct control. In FY 1999, these `uncontrollable costs' will amount to more than $200 million. 
Lest any of my colleagues feel these costs are attributable to a bloated bureaucracy, I note that Department of the Interior staffing in Washington, D.C. is 17% below its 1993 base--despite a significant expansion since that time in the number of parks, refuges, and other Interior programs, most of which have been authorized by Congress. This 17% reduction is the second greatest among all civilian cabinet agencies. While the Subcommittee continues to seek efficiencies and to terminate wasteful programs, yearly increases in pay and related costs for core Federal employees continue to consume most or all of any increases that the Subcommittee may receive in its allocation. 
Having noted two of the major factors impacting funding levels in this year's bill, I want to highlight some priority programs where we were able to provide modest--but significant--increases. The bill includes a $55 million increase for operation of the national park system, including increases over the current year level of $18 million for park maintenance, $15 million for special need parks, and $10 million for an across-the-board increase in park operations. These increases will benefit all parks, but particularly those units with severe operational shortfalls and critical deficiencies in maintenance funding. The bill also provides a $10.6 million increase in refuge operations and maintenance, which follows a $41 million increase provided in last year's bill. 
For the Forest Service, this bill places a heavy emphasis on improving accountability within the agency. A number of General Accounting Office reports and various Congressional hearings have clearly demonstrated that the Forest Service lacks the fundamental ability to account for its expenditures, and has shown a growing level of overhead and indirect expenses that corresponds with a decline in on-the-ground accomplishment. I am disturbed by these problems, but at the same time am wary of overreacting by mandating controls that may be counterproductive. I do see indications that the agency is determined to address its accountability problem. 
With these considerations in mind, I have included language in the bill to require increased accountability by eliminating the general administration line item, and requiring the Forest Service to display clearly the source of funds that go to overhead and other indirect expenses. We have also consolidated three budget line items, where maintenance functions are performed along with other work, into two distinct line items where only maintenance, reconstruction and construction activities occur. I hope that actions such as this, along with commitment from top Forest Service officials, will help the agency to institute proper management controls and clean up its accountability mess. 
The other major Forest Service initiative in this bill deals with the amount of timber the Forest Service will be expected to offer for sale. In 1990, the Forest Service offered for sale approximately 11 billion board feet of timber. In fiscal year 1999, the Administration proposes to offer only 3.4 billion board feet. That's a 69% reduction. Many of my colleagues know first hand the devastating effect that this reduced timber program has had on timber dependent communities. With timber growth rates far in excess of 10 billion board feet per year, it is unconscionable that the administration proposes a timber offer level of less than one-third of that amount. Accordingly, the Committee has provided additional funding, and expects the Forest Service to sell approximately 3.6 billion board feet of timber in fiscal year 1999. This amount is 200 million board feet more than proposed by the administration, but about 200 million board feet less than the fiscal year 1998 level. I also want to note that this 3.6 billion board feet figure is a correction of the 3.784 billion board feet figure incorrectly included in the Committee report. 
The bill also includes $10 million for the administration's Millennium initiative for historic preservation projects of national importance. Due to the constraints of the Subcommittee's allocation and a general aversion to beginning new programs, I had not intended to provide funds for the Millennium program. But I found the Millennium program's primary advocate --the First Lady--to be very persuasive when she called me at the urging of Senator Bumpers. I look forward to working with her to define better how these funds might be used. To balance the increase provided for historic preservation projects on a national level, the bill also includes a 20 percent $6 million increase for the existing grants-to-States program in the Historic Preservation Fund account. 
The bill also includes funds for a number of specific historic preservation projects, including $3 million for the Smithsonian Institution for rehabilitation of the Star Spangled 
Banner. This appropriation will complement non-federal funds that have been pledged for this project by the Pew Charitable Trusts, and most recently by Ralph Lauren. The bill also provides funds to continue construction of the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall, and to continue renovation of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. 
For the agency that receives perhaps more attention than any other in this bill--the National Endowment for the Arts--the bill provides just over $100 million. This is precisely the same funding level as was approved by the Senate last year, but a slight increase over the final appropriation. I also note that the bill continues the several reforms that were agreed to during deliberations on the fiscal year 1998 bill, including restrictions on individual grants, subgrants, and seasonal support; limitations on total grants to any one State, and increased emphasis on arts education and programs for under served populations. With the House having voted by a substantial margin to provide level funding for the NEA, the gap to be bridged in conference will be far narrower than it was last year. The National Endowment for the Humanities is funded at $110.7 million in the Senate bill, the same as the fiscal year 1998 level. 
For the Indian Programs that comprise approximately 30 percent of the Interior bill, the biggest challenge for the Committee was to attempt to fill the gaping hole left by the administration's budget request for the Indian Health Service. Facing the challenges of a deteriorating infrastructure, increasing service population growth, and a relatively high rate of inflation in the medical services sector, the Indian Health Service was nevertheless the only major Interior bill agency that did not share in the bounty of the administration's inflated budget request. 
The Committee has provided a $53 million increase for the Indian Health Service, $34 million more than the budget request. This includes more than $16 million to staff newly completed health facilities--an item for which the administration inexplicably did not request funding. The amount provided also includes funds to cover a modest portion of IHS's fixed cost increases, which the administration also did not include in its budget. 
To some extent the increase provided for the Indian Health Service comes at the expense of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Although the bill does provide a $15 million increase for the Operation of Indian Programs account, the overall BIA budget is essentially flat. But even if the resources available to the Subcommittee were less constrained, I think it would be imprudent to provide a significant increase for the largest of BIA programs--Tribal Priority Allocations--until we develop a more rational means of allocating TPA funds. As it stands, some $757 million in TPA funds are distributed in a manner that ignores the relative financial health and needs of the recipient Tribes. 
Though its history is difficult to trace, the current allocation system seems to have been developed piecemeal over a period of decades through a combination of departmental, tribal and congressional actions. Each of these individual actions may have made perfect sense at the time at which it was taken. But their cumulative effect has been to create a system in which a number of quite wealthy tribes receive far greater per capita TPA allocations than some of the most destitute tribes. While I cannot imagine that such a system would ever be seen as appropriate, it is almost offensive in a time when Federal appropriations are severely constrained by balanced budget requirements, and when a number of tribes are profiting quite handsomely from business ventures such as gaming. 
The bill before the Senate attempts to address this inequity by mandating that the BIA identify the top 10 percent of tribes in terms of per capita tribal revenue, and directing the BIA to distribute half of the TPA payments that would have gone to those tribes to the 20 percent of tribes with the lowest per capita tribal revenue. The bill also directs BIA to develop possible formulas for the future distribution of TPA funds, and gives the Bureau authority to collect the information required to develop such formulas. 
I recognize, that this is not a perfect solution. Many have expressed concerns about the manner in which funds are proposed for distribution in FY 1999, the extent to which BIA should be authorized to collect financial information from the tribes, and the degree to which tribes themselves should be involved in the reallocation process. But few, if any, have argued that the current distribution system is either just or a wise use of taxpayer dollars. I have had extensive discussions about this issue with the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Mr. Kevin Gover, as well as with Senator Campbell, Senator Inouye and other interested colleagues. I am pleased that these discussions have resulted in alternative language that I believe will have widespread support and can be adopted as an amendment to this bill. The new language permits the wealthiest tribes to return voluntarily Tribal Priority Allocations to the BIA for redistribution to the neediest. However, the substitute language does not diminish the Federal Government's trust responsibilities or that tribe's ability to access future appropriations. In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs is directed to develop, within Congressionally mandated obligations, a new method for distributing TPA funds by April 1, 1999. Finally, the substitute language excludes from the redistribution plan payments made by the Federal Government in settlement of claims and judgments and income derived from lands, natural resources, or funds held in trust by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Mr. President, in this bill there are a number of other legislative provisions and limitations on the use of funds about which my colleagues may have heard. The administration and its advisors in the environmental community have evidently decided to attack these provisions en masse, arguing that they represent `stealth' or `dark of night' attacks on the environment by Republicans. This tells me three things. First, the administration is reluctant to argue any one of these issues on its merits. Second, the administration has not been paying attention in any of the dozens of Congressional hearings that have been held on these issues, the vast majority of which included administration witnesses. And third, the administration is either unaware of, or is choosing to ignore, the historic oversight role of the Appropriations Committee under the leadership of both Democrats and Republicans. 
There are indeed several legislative provisions and limitations on the use of funds in this year's Interior bill. There are a few more such provisions than were in the Senate version of the bill last year, but fewer than in the final FY 1997 Act. Some of the provisions have been inserted at the request of fellow Republicans. Some, such as the mining patent moratorium and the moratoria on offshore oil and gas development, are included at the request of the administration or my Democratic colleagues. These provisions are inserted in appropriations bills for one of several reasons, Mr. President. Some are included to address critical health and safety issues that require immediate attention. The King Cove road provision falls into this category. Other provisions are included because they are an integral part of the Committee's fiscal oversight role. The provision regarding distribution of TPA funds falls into this category, as does a provision in the bill that provides for the orderly termination of the overpriced and out of control Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project. 
But perhaps the single most common reason that legislative provisions and limitations on the use of funds are included in this bill is the overzealous use of regulatory powers by the executive branch without the adequate involvement of Congress or the public. This is the dynamic that has prompted any number of such provisions, from the moratoria on offshore oil and gas development that are included in this bill year after year, to the provision in this year's bill that requires a comprehensive study of regulations governing mining on public lands. If it seems that there are more limitations on the use of funds in this bill than there have been in the past, it is very likely because this administration has made a conscious decision not to engage Congress in a constructive dialogue on a whole array of critically needed reforms to insensitive land management decisions, and has instead decided to press the top-down, Washington, D.C.-knows-best agenda of its extremist environmental allies through the use of Executive orders and over broad regulatory actions that in some cases are downright insulting to me as a member of the legislative branch. 
In about every case, these riders have the support of all--or a vast majority of--the members of the House and Senate in the districts and States to which they apply. Generally speaking, Members of both bodies defer to judgment of the Members affected by regional policies and issues. This administration, however, constantly demands the right to override the views of Members immediately affected, and their constituents, with a constant and pervasive `DC knows best' attitude. In any debate over these issues, I ask my colleagues to listen with care and sympathy to the Members whose constituents lives are so often arrogantly ignored by unelected bureaucrats. 
If the administration or any Member of the Senate wishes to discuss or debate the merits of any individual provision in this bill, I am willing to do so. But I find it ludicrous--if not offensive--for the Administration simply to lump every provision it finds the least bit inconvenient onto one list of so-called `objectionable riders,' condemn the use of such provisions as some new and nefarious practice, and to demand that all such provisions be removed under threat of a veto. I fully anticipate some give and take with the administration as this bill moves through conference, but it is not the job of the Senate simply to approve administration requests for funding and trust that it will be spent wisely and in accordance with the intent of Congress. We have plenty of experience to the contrary, both with the current and previous administrations. 
Finally, I want to address an issue about which I am asked persistently, and that is the disposition of the $699 million `special' appropriation for land acquisition included in the FY 1998 bill. My colleagues may recall that $362 million of those funds remain to be allocated to specific projects. That allocation will be made by agreement of the House and Senate committees, and will be transmitted to the administration by letter. I have had several discussions with Chairman Regula about this issue, and hope that we--together with Senator Byrd and Congressman Yates--can agree on an allocation of at least half of these funds in the very near future. I unfortunately cannot now say exactly when this allocation will be finalized, but I am confident that it will be soon, and that we will do our best to balance the priorities of the Senate, the House and the administration. 
On a personal level, I want to say one final thank you--for the record--to Sue Masica, who has for years been Senator Byrd's clerk for the Interior Subcommittee. Sue has been a tremendous resource for me and my staff, and I can say with great confidence has also been of assistance at one time or another to just about every Member in this Chamber, whether that Member knew it or not. Sue is now the Associate Director of Administration for the National Park Service, a position in which I know she will excel. I wish her the very best. I also want to recognize Sue's replacement--Kurt Dodd--and welcome him to the Committee staff. 
On my personal staff, I thank Chuck Berwick, Kari Vander Stoep, and Todd Young for their many contributions to this bill. I also thank Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Hank Kashdan, Leif Fonnesbeck, Kevin Johnson, and our detailee Mary Ellen Mueller for their hard work and long hours spent on this bill. I also thank Carole Geagley and Craig Leff of Senator Byrd's staff, and Steve Cortese, Jim English and Jay Kimmitt of the full committee staff for their many courtesies and willing assistance given to me and my staff. 
With that, I look forward to hearing from my friend and colleague, the Senator from West Virginia.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year about this time during the debate on this bill, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, proposed an amendment to earmark certain amounts of money for the preservation and protection of Civil War battlefield sites. At that point, while as a Civil War buff I greatly sympathize with them, we didn't know where the earmark would come from. It is now possible in this bill to meet the most worthy goals of that pair of bipartisan Senators. 
This amendment earmarks up to $10 million of both fiscal year 1998 and 1999 money--$10 million total--for matching grants for up to 50 percent of the total cost of any such acquisition with States and local communities and private entities based on a July 1993 report of the Nation's Civil War battlefields prepared by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission. So it means that there will be more leverage for the acquisition of various Civil War battle sites, mostly, I think, on secondary battles. 
It is a highly worthy proposal. I very much favor it. At the same time, the majority leader, feeling that the Senate absolutely needs to do its business, and because as is usual and customary, unfortunately, at the beginning of debate over appropriations bills, we don't get people down here to offer their amendments, he has asked me to move to table the amendment and to take a vote on that. Therefore, Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have a series of amendments that we may be able to deal with soon, none of which will be particularly controversial. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, does have a different subject to which he would like to speak shortly. I intend to defer to him on that. 
But the important message to all of our colleagues, the message in effect given by this last vote, is this is an important appropriations bill. It is, in fact, controversial. We have a list of perhaps 60 amendments that are likely to come up on it at one point or another. Members should, I hope, be prepared to come to the floor of the Senate with those amendments and have them considered in an orderly fashion under which there is a reasonable amount of time for debate rather than to crowd them up against the end of the debate on this bill. 
It may very well be that later on in the afternoon we will have an amendment on this bill on an entirely different and very controversial subject, which will then essentially take us off of the Interior bill. Before that takes place, however, the managers of the bill would be very pleased to deal with amendments that relate to the bill itself. I ask Members to come to the floor with those amendments. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate considers appropriations for foreign operations, I would like to recognize the efforts of two organizations headquartered in my home state of Washington. World Vision Relief and Development (WVRD) and World Concern Development Organization (WCDO) have made great strides in bringing hope to a troubled world. 
On countless occasions, World Vision has achieved its objective of long-term transformation of human lives through effective implementation of emergency relief, rehabilitation and sustainable development programs throughout the world. World Vision, which is largely funded through the generosity of Americans, has operations in approximately 94 different countries. Of particular note is World Vision's efforts on behalf of the world's children. Through tireless efforts in public health and nutrition, the organization has allowed children to survive. 
In Sudan, World Vision has shown courageous long-term interest in the tragedy that continues to unfold there. Since operating in Sudan since the early 1980s, World Vision has provided 4 therapeutic feeding centers, brought medical supplies and services to the needy, and been committed to long-term agricultural development. 
WCDO based in Seattle works in the areas of relief, rehabilitation and development to help the recipients in developing countries achieve self-sufficiency, economic independence, physical health and spiritual peace through integrated community development. WCDO fosters crop improvement through new crops, cash crops and improved seed demonstration projects. It has also raised world literacy rates, developed communities, provided shelter for refugees, and given thousands the skills necessary to survive and grow. The world is a better place with WCDO in it. 
I know the Senate will join me in saluting the care World Vision and World Concern have shown for those in desperate need of compassion and a helping hand.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at an earlier date, on the bill similar to this relating to foreign policy, I discussed some of the policies of the International Monetary Fund in that connection with respect to Indonesia while Indonesia was still ruled by the Suhartos. That amendment, or a modification of that amendment, was included in the original passage of the International Monetary Fund refurbishment and, in fact, is included in this bill, although it is close to irrelevant now that the Government of Indonesia is in different hands and in considerable need of aid, as was indicated by some of the debate on the previous amendment. 
This amendment deals with my deep concern, a concern I believe widely shared, with respect to the way in which the International Monetary Fund is handling the problems in Russia. The amendment--a sense of the Senate directed at the International Monetary Fund--makes two points in that connection. The first cautions the International Monetary Fund against funding any Russian Government in which the Communist Party of Russia plays a significant role with respect to economic policy. We know that the Russian Government is in chaos at the present time after the firing of one Prime Minister by President Yeltsin and the substitution for him, at least at the behest of the President, of Mr. Chernomyrdin, a previous Prime Minister of Russia. 
His nomination was just rejected yesterday by the Russian Duma. We don't know where it will go. What we do know is that the Government of Russia was very close to an agreement with the Russian Communist Party, under which the Communist Party would play a major role in the Government and a major role in its economic policies, that major role being to reverse free market reforms and return to state control of the economy. It would be foolishness exemplified, were we to fund such a change in the Russian Government through the International Monetary Fund, and this amendment cautions against it. 
It also deals with another subject, the subject of all of the billions of dollars that the International Monetary Fund has granted to Russia already on condition that it move more decisively toward a free market economy. While the International Monetary Fund has dealt very firmly with respect to free market conditions in dealing with the crisis in Southeast Asia--with the Republic of Korea, with Thailand, with Malaysia, with Indonesia and the like--it has consistently operated with a double standard with respect to Russia. The double standard has not only wasted money, the double standard has created justified unhappiness, justified bitterness in the Southeast Asian countries that see the International Monetary Fund imposing a double standard: One very tough standard on them and far more lax standards or, rather, standards that are consistently ignored with respect to Russia. 
So this amendment, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment, also calls for a single standard with respect to International Monetary Fund funding of Russia, even in a noncommunist government, and the similarly situated countries in Southeast Asia. As the chairman of the subcommittee said, I think this represents a broadly held point of view. I am not sure that it should not be a part of the bill as a mandate on the way in which we deal with the International Monetary Fund, but because I cannot see the future, it is merely a sense of the Senate at this point.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is the world's greatest deliberative body. The U.S. economy is the world's greatest free market. Lately, it seems my friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, would like to use the one to squash the other. 
As my colleagues and most Americans know, Senator Hatch has joined forces with the success-busters of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to carve out a special place in the market for companies that cannot compete on their own merits. All of this is being done at the expense of one of America's most successful and innovative companies--Microsoft. 
Last week, the Judiciary Committee, for the third time this year, served as a forum for frustrated business executives who have been outsmarted and out-innovated by Microsoft. 
I have continually voiced my objections at the Senate Judiciary's Committee's insistence on inserting itself into battles that should be fought in the free market, not in the Halls of the U.S. Senate or in the Justice Department. 
I have asserted my opinion that U.S. antitrust laws were written with the intent of protecting consumers, not inferior companies. And I have stood up against those who would like to see the federal government, not the free market, decide which companies are successful in this country and which are not. 
But Senator Hatch has offered his committee as a haven for the unwashed masses of corporate America, sheltering the weak and wary from the harsh brutality of the free market. 
This debate has been just that, Mr. President, a debate between two Senators with very different opinions on a matter of importance to both Senators and to the nation as a whole. 
Earlier this week, however, I learned of something that troubles me deeply, both as a Senator and as an American. 
In the July 29, issue of Investor's Business Daily Senator Hatch was interviewed about his views on Microsoft. As my colleagues will recall, one of the witnesses at last week's hearing was Rob Glaser, CEO of a company in my home state called RealNetworks, a Microsoft competitor. Allegations arose at the hearing, supported by an affidavit from a senior Microsoft executive, that Mr. Glaser had attempted to use his testimony as a negotiating tool in his ongoing battle with Microsoft. 
According to the affidavit, Mr. Glaser, the night before he was to testify before the Judiciary Committee, called a senior Microsoft executive and offered to `negotiate all night if that's what it takes' to come to terms with Microsoft. The affidavit states that `Mr. Glaser said that if the negotiations he proposed . . . resulted in an agreement between the two companies, he would not testify the next day. 
These allegations are disturbing to me, and I had hoped, to Senator Hatch as well. 
But Senator Hatch, in his interview with Investor's Business Daily seems to support Mr. Glaser's attempt to use the Judiciary Committee as a tool in his negotiations with Microsoft. 
When asked about the allegations, Senator Hatch said, `Glaser said he did not (use the testimony as a negotiating weapon), but what if he did? He's a guy trying to save his business. . .' The distinguished Senator from Utah goes on to say of witnesses that testify before his committee, `if they gain something by coming, all the better as far as I'm concerned, as long as they tell the truth.' 
It may be incidental to this attitude, Mr. President, but important in the public's mind that it turns out that Microsoft Media Player 5.2 did not disable RealNetworks' new G-2 player--in fact, the culprit was a bug in the player itself--not only in Microsoft's tests, but in those of a number of independent experts as well. So far, Senator Hatch has ignored this unpleasant news. 
Our founding fathers must be turning over in their graves, Mr. President. The United States Senate was never intended to be, and should never be, used as negotiating tool for companies trying to compete in the free market. In fact, the United States Senate was designed, among other things, to protect that very free market. That should continue to be our goal.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have heard a large number of words and speeches on this floor, of course, in the last 2 or 3 months on the plight of the American farmer. Many called for a return to the policies of yesteryear. I am here this morning in contrast to talk about 10 impediments or evidences of indifference on the part of this administration to the farmers and the agricultural communities of the State of Washington, the Pacific Northwest, and all of America which can be solved simply by the administration's willingness to care about those Americans who produce our food and fibers. 
So in the classic way that we give lists of 10, I will start, Mr. President, with number 10, the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Program. A bloated attempt begun 4 years ago, to have lasted 1 year would cost $5 million, which is now approaching $40 million in 4 years, and has antagonized all of the private interests in the Interior Columbia Basin, all of the Members of Congress who represent any part of that basin, but the continuance of which is demanded by the President as the price of signing an appropriations bill for the Department of Interior. 
I held a field hearing on this subject in Spokane, WA, with unanimous or near unanimous opposition to the program as it is being conducted at the present time. Both the bill that I am in charge of managing and the bill that has already passed the House of Representatives dramatically changes and minimizes that program. 
At the behest of this administration, however, a Seattle Congressman put up an amendment to restore the program to its present pristine size. Every Member of the House of Representatives representing any part of the Columbia Basin voted against that amendment, and yet the administration continues to demand it, with all of the interference of private agriculture that it entails. 
No. 9, the Department of Agriculture budget--welfare over farmers. Two-thirds of the Department of Agriculture's budget is earmarked for food and for welfare programs. The essential research conservation and on-the-ground farmer programs get lost in the shuffle. Only when there is a crisis does the Secretary of Agriculture pay any attention to them. 
For 3 consecutive years, the administration's request for farmer programs have decreased while the amount requested for food and nutrition programs has increased. No one disputes the importance of those food and nutrition programs, but we cannot very well feed America without providing the funding and infrastructure necessary to enhance the production of the most healthy, abundant, safe and inexpensive crops in the world. 
No. 8, Columbia-Snake River dams. The President's Council on Environmental Policy of the Department of the Interior had made it quite clear that major dam removal is very high on their agenda of courses of action for the Columbia and Snake Rivers. The Columbia Basin in eastern Washington, in eastern Oregon, and in Idaho, was literally a dust bowl until the introduction of irrigation. Without it, those States would not lead the country in apples, hops, asparagus, and potato production. 
The Columbia Basin is a cornucopia for the Nation's food supply. Dam drawdown or removal would shut down agriculture in the region. In addition, of course, those rivers provide the avenues of transportation to get those agricultural products to market, a transportation system that would be destroyed by dam removal. 
No. 7, China trade policy--Washington wheat farmers seem not worth helping by this administration. For more than 20 years, China has refused to import Pacific Northwest wheat because of unfounded, nonscientific phytosanitary reasons. They call it `TCK smut.' TCK smut has never been detected in Washington wheat. It does exist, however, in the fields of our wheat-growing counterparts--Canada, France and Germany; but China imports from all three. 
The administration seeks a new set of trade relations with China. The President went to China. The President, in order to keep peace with China, did not so much as mention these trade barriers, ignoring the plight of our wheat farmers in the Pacific Northwest. His first priority should be to get that barrier lifted. 
No. 6, repeated efforts to eliminate agricultural research. For the past 2 years, the administration has recommended zeroing out all of the national regionally based agriculture research programs. These programs conduct research necessary to all food-producing regions of the country. The administration's insistence on nationalizing these programs is ludicrous. Obviously, cotton research cannot and should not be conducted in eastern Washington; and red delicious apple research is not conducted in Mississippi. These regional programs have bolstered our already strained land grant education university programs. They are absolutely essential, and yet the administration would wipe them out. 
No. 5, no movement on fast-track trade negotiating authority. Fast track is essential to establishing trade relations with Chile. Currently, the United States exports face an 11-percent tariff in that country, giving our competitors an 11-percent advantage. Yet, because of objections from members of his own party, the President has abandoned the cause of fast-track trade authority. 
No. 4, the agricultural labor shortage--not our problem. The administration does not seem to believe that there is an agriculture labor shortage and is opposed to the Guest Worker Program to address this issue that has already passed the Senate of the United States. In the face of that fact, the General Accounting Office estimates that over one-third of our Nation's migrant workforce is illegal. By doing nothing, the Clinton administration is making lawbreakers out of law-abiding agriculture employers and proposes to do nothing about it. 
No. 3, sanctions against Pakistan. Sanctions are killing our agriculture industries. With more than 40 percent of the world's population under U.S. sanctions, the American farmer is locked out of many markets. The President instantly imposed sanctions on Pakistan as a result of its nuclear tests, and only as a result of action by Congress have those sanctions or the effect of those sanctions been at least partially removed with respect to Pakistan. 
No. 2, the Endangered Species Act and private property rights. The Endangered Species Act impacts eastern Washington farmers and many others more than any other environmental regulation, and yet the administration, rather than assist in reasonable amendments to the Endangered Species Act, insists on ever more rigid enforcement and ever more interference with the ability of our farmers to grow the food and fiber that the Nation needs. 
No. 1, Al Gore. President Clinton has officially tagged the Vice President as the administration's environmental leader. He is the promulgator of most of the policies that I have already discussed and has constructed environmental roadblocks and headaches for farmers from Washington State all across the United States to Florida. 
No one knows the land better than America's hard-working farm families. The District of Columbia, the administration, and Al Gore should not be dictating to America's farmers how to till, harvest, irrigate, employ, and manage their farms. Al Gore and his administration need to focus on foreign trade and agricultural research, not on locking up private property and overregulating the family farm. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on July 23, the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management held a hearing on legislation I have introduced to complete an important land exchange in my state. The bill, S. 2136, would authorize and direct the Forest Service to conclude an exchange with Plum Creek Timber Company which has been under formal discussion for several years. 
The exchange is in an area of Washington surrounding the Interstate 90 corridor through the central Cascades. This area is characterized by a `checkerboard' ownership pattern of intermingled ownership between Plum Creek and the Forest Service. These lands are among the most studied not only in my state but the Nation. 
The problems of checkerboard ownership are well recognized and understood in the west and northwest. This exchange, trading 60,000 of Plum Creek land for 40,000 acres of Forest Service land, would help resolve many management issues for both owners. It would make management more efficient, especially on an ecosystem basis. 
I introduced my bill to provide impetus to complete this exchange by year's end because of the need for a speedy resolution. If the exchange is not completed by the end of this year, Plum Creek will have no choice but to resume logging their land in 1999. The company has deferred harvests on 90 percent of the exchange lands for the past 2 years and they have firmly stated they cannot continue to do so. 
There is broad public support for the exchange and for completing it in a timely fashion. Our governor, Gary Locke, and the Lands Commissioner, Jennifer Belcher, have endorsed the exchange--urging it's completion by the end of 1998. The State Legislature unanimously approved a resolution in support of the I-90 exchange. Major newspapers in Seattle and other cities have recognized the need to finish this exchange. Many environmental groups support a land exchange. 
Mr. President, our subcommittee hearing pointed out the difficult problems we face in Washington when we try to resolve issues. There always seems to be a controversy, no matter how worthy the purpose. My legislation and the I-90 exchange are no different. 
Representatives from the environmental community, Plum Creek and the Forest Service testified on July 23. While mainstream environmental groups heartily support an exchange, they would prefer to see changes in the lands package identified in a draft Environmental Impact Statement released earlier this spring. Environmental groups are concerned about legislation circumventing appeals and litigation. 
The Forest Service wants to complete the exchange, but opposes legislation. I am disappointed that the Administration, having worked on this proposal for so long, would oppose a bill designed to enact a land exchange it has negotiated. Each party has spent over $1 million getting to this point. Must we spend more, only to run the risk of seeing the entire exchange fall apart as a result of the heavy weight of appeals and litigation? 
The I-90 exchange has been proposed in various shapes and sizes for more than a decade. Since it was first considered, the Northern Spotted Owl has been listed under the Endangered Species Act and the President has put his Northwest Forest Plan in effect. Plum Creek has even completed a massive Habitat Conservation Plan on 170,000 acres of its lands--including those in this exchange. This Plan, now two years old, was negotiated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. With this background and the resulting studies, I am confident we can complete an exchange on these lands that represents a consensus. 
Mr. President, I recognize and support the idea of getting it right. We have been at this exchange too long not to do just that. When I introduced S. 2136, I indicated it was simply a place holder. The final Environmental Impact Statement will be completed later this summer. It has been my intention to amend the legislation to incorporate necessary changes based on the final EIS. 
After hearing the testimony of all parties, I have urged them to work together to identify a lands package that can be incorporated in the final EIS. Further I am asking the Forest Service to move up the deadline for completing a final EIS to September 10 and forwarding it to the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands Management. Such a document--presented to Congress in a timely manner--will leave all options open this year. I continue to believe legislating this exchange is the right thing to do. 
Mr. President, there are many who question why Congress should legislate this or any land exchange. This is common practice. Congress has not shied away from passing land trades in the past and we should not in this instance when a consensus may be eminent. 
In an editorial on the exchange The Seattle Times stated, `The perfect as enemy of the good is a common phrase these days, but it remains appropriate to this situation. A transfer of 100,000 acres with a net gain of 20,000 to the public has a long-term ring to it that future generations may see as prescient. Those are powerful reasons to walk toward this agreement with eyes open, but keep walking.'

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, our self-proclaimed `Education President' has just seen fit to veto the most significant bipartisan education legislation passed by the 105th Congress--the Education Savings and School Excellence Act. As many Americans know, this legsilation's main feature is to allow families to establish education savings accounts in which parents can invest $2,000 a year and allow that money to grow tax free. Parents can use the money to pay for school expenses including tutoring, computers, school fees and private school tuition. 
Why has the President seen fit to veto this legislation? Well, he has received a great deal of pressure from those who believe that we should not increase the control parents have over the education of their children. 
In addition to providing tax-free education savings accounts for families, this legislation includes provisions that would: authorize a literacy program to improve the reading skills of America's youth; allow Federal funding for education reform projects that provide same gender schools and classrooms; allow States to make awards to public schools that demonstrate a high level of academic achievement; and allow states to test teachers and provide merit pay programs. 
With the recent news that 60 percent of prospective teachers in Massachuesetts taking a basic certification test were unable to pass, it is unfortunate that the President's veto will not allow States like Massachusetts to help current and prospective teachers reach their full potential, as well as reward those who perform in a superior manner. I signed a letter to the President along with 42 other senators asking that he sign the education savings account legislation and pointing out this very feature. Unfortunately, our plea fell on deaf ears. 
Mr. President, I have worked diligently to fashion, over the past year a return to our parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members control over the education of their children. The Federal Government has too much influence and misuses too many resources that would be better spent in classrooms across America. 
As a member of the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force, I found that no one in the Federal Government even knows exactly how many education programs are overseen by the Federal Government. Although the Department of Education annually publishes a `Digest of Education Statistics,' the most recent version of which is over 500 pages in length, there is no mention of how many education programs are administered by Federal agencies. 
I have, however, heard testimony from the General Accounting Office about the duplication of Federal education programs. In January of this year Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the GAO appeared before the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force and presented us with a graphic that highlights the web of Federal education programs in only three areas of education: at-risk and delinquent youth, early childhood programs, and teacher training programs. Dr. Joyner explained to us that 15 Federal departments and agencies administer 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs, 11 Federal departments and agencies administer more than 90 early childhood programs, and 9 Federal departments and agencies administer 86 teacher training programs. 
It is no wonder that more and more, States and local school districts are suffocated by a tidal wave of papers, forms and programs, each of which no doubt began with good intentions. The net result of this tidal wave, however, is precisely what makes it difficult to set priorities in each of the states and school districts across the country to determine that which will best serve their students. 
As I have stated previously, the only reason I can discern that the President would veto this legislation is that he believes that schools will be improved through more control from Washington, D.C. Unlike the President, however, I believe our best hope for improving the education of our children is to put the American people in charge of their local schools. 
I also believe it is appropriate at this time to give my colleagues in the Senate some good news on the education front. Last Friday, the House Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations adopted a report entitled `Education at a Crossroads: What Works and 
What's Wasted in Education Today' by a vote of 5-2. This report is a result of two-and-a-half years of work by that subcommittee and the dedication of it's chairman, Congressman Hoekstra. The report is more than 70 pages long and I will not touch on all the issues it discusses, but I do want to point out some of the conclusions the subcommittee reached. 
The report's conclusion states in part:  
. . . the central theme of what we learned is that the federal government cannot consistently and effectively replicate success stories throughout the nation in the form of federal programs. Instead, federal education dollars should support effective State and local initiatives, ensuring that neither impedes local innovation and control, nor diverts dollars from the classroom through burdensome regulations and overhead. 
The report goes on to give specific steps for Congress to take to improve education in America. The report advocates increasing the ability of States and local communities to waive federal education regulations, reducing the tax burden on families, passing tax-free education savings account legislation, improving federal support for charter schools, and otherwise encouraging more parental choice in education. 
I have long been an advocate of many of the suggestions outlined in this report. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will take the time to review the report Congressman Hoekstra's subcommittee has prepared and consider where they stand on these issues. It is long past time for both parties in Congress to stop simply giving lip service to the idea of local control of education, and to put our money where our mouths are. 
Finally, I want to remind my colleagues that although I have introduced and passed twice in the last year an amendment that would allow States and local school districts increased control over the education of their children. Because of the insistence of Democrats in the Senate, the President, and even some Members of my own party this legislation has not yet survived a conference committee. Although I have not yet been successful in passing this legislation into law to give States and local communities the relief they deserve and need to improve education in America, I will again in the near future propose legislation that moves us toward this goal. Whether through block grants or some other means, I am committed to the belief that real education reform will not take place through '. . . guidance from above . . .', but from parents and educators in communities across this land as they are empowered to direct the education of their children. 
Mr. President, I note also present on the floor is Senator Frist, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee task force on education, whose work is of equal importance to that of Congressman Hoekstra's and whose report I also commend to the Members of this body. He is our great expert on health care, but he is also a major leader in education reform in the U.S. Senate, and we all owe him a great debt of gratitude.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, these agricultural workers are already here. The Senator from California spoke of 2 million illegal workers already here. But we would think from the remarks of the opponents of this amendment that somehow or another we were spoiling a very good system that gave high wages, a wonderful set of attractions, and only needed to be strengthened. We aren't, Mr. President. 
We have a situation that makes a violator of the law out of almost every agricultural employer in the United States of America who needs labor on a seasonal basis. What we propose to do is to say that many of these workers, whatever their conditions, are infinitely superior to the country from which they came, which is the reason they are willing to pay good money to be smuggled across our borders, several of whom die in the desert in the attempt to hide during the time that they are here, not to claim any of the rights they might otherwise have. 
Our proposal would make many of them legally here, with very real rights, with the ability to go home legally and to come back again legally, rather than to have to stay because of the difficulty of crossing the border. Mr. President, tens of thousands of words have been uttered on the floor of this Senate in the last 3 weeks about the plight of our farmers, with collapsed Asian markets and lower prices. Here, for once, we have an opportunity to do something tangible for our farm community, to give them the labor that they cannot get in any legal fashion from citizens, or others, to allow them to be law-abiding, as they wish to do; and instead we have an argument that we better keep the present system; we better keep a system in which there are millions of illegal farm workers here because we don't care to try something that allows this labor to be provided legally. That is the difference. 
Do we want the labor that is there now, and will be there tomorrow, to be legal labor? Or do we think the present situation with all these illegals is perfectly fine? Yes or no; up or down. Let's allow these people to be here legally, to help us to improve their own lives legally.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Justice Department is out of control, Mr. President. Evidence appears to be mounting that officials at the Department's Antitrust Division have been traveling around the world urging foreign governments to join them in their witch hunt against Microsoft. 
As far as this Senator is concerned, such action should be prohibited. 
It seems the Administration is reaching out a helping hand to U.S. competitors overseas. While foreign governments work hard to protect their most important industries, our Justice Department is assisting those foreign governments in their efforts to keep one of America's most vibrant, innovative, and successful companies out of their markets. 
In a letter sent last week to Attorney General Janet Reno, my colleagues Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl raised some provocative questions about the activities of Justice Department officials overseas. They have learned that Joel Klein and his staff at the Department's Antitrust Division are busily recruiting their foreign counterparts in their war against Microsoft. 
First and foremost, Mr. President, I'd like to know what Justice Department officials, whose work focuses exclusively on issues here at home, are doing traveling overseas at the taxpayers' expense. According to the letter, in the last six months, Joel Klein has traveled to Japan, Russell Pittman, Chief of the Competition Policy Section of the Antitrust Division has visited Brazil, Dan Rubinfeld, chief economist for the Antitrust Division has gone to Israel, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General Douglas Melamed spent a week in Paris in June. 
At a time when Joel Klein has been complaining that his division does not have enough money or people to do its job effectively, he and his staff are traveling around the world on the Justice Department's dime. And they are using those foreign visits as a bully pulpit to tout the merits of their case against Microsoft and encouraging foreign governments to join in the attack. 
This kind of activity is reprehensible. It is even more egregious when one notes that it is being financed by the American people--many of whom may wind up losing their jobs and their livelihood if Joel Klein is successful. 
Here is the evidence my colleagues have compiled to date: 
Joel Klein visited Japan to meet with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission last December. A month later, the Trade Commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices, confiscating thousands of company documents. 
When Russell Pittman went to Brazil in May, he spoke publicly to senior Brazilian government officials responsible for antitrust enforcement in that country, outlining the Justice Department's case against Microsoft in detail. Nine days later, The Brazilian government announced its intention to begin legal proceedings against the company. 
A quote from Mr. Pittman at this event is particularly troubling, and, I might add, somewhat ironic. He accused Microsoft of behaving `like an arrogant monopolist, even acting arrogantly in its relations with the antitrust authorities, it will receive from these agencies what it deserves.' Who is calling whom arrogant? A government bureaucrat on a taxpayer funded jaunt to Brazil? If the situation were not so serious, I would find this quote to be quite amusing, Mr. President. 
In Israel in May, Dan Rubinfeld gave a public speech on the Department's case against Microsoft to an audience that included Israeli officials responsible for antitrust enforcement. He later met privately along with his sidekicks from the Federal Trade Commission with a group of Israeli government officials to outline the DOJ's complaint against Microsoft. 
Not surprisingly, the Israeli government is now in discussions with Microsoft concerning its business practices in that country. 
And finally, on June 8th, Douglas Melamed briefed the OECD's Competition Law and Policy Committee in Paris on the strengths of the Department's case against Microsoft. The OECD Committee includes officials from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Brazil. 
I applaud Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl for bringing this issue to light, Mr. President. It is just one in a series of steps by the Administration to tie the hands of successful U.S. companies. 
Thousands of jobs in my home state of Washington are being put on the line by a contemptuous group of bureaucrats over at the Justice Department. 
That is why I have decided to offer an amendment today to prohibit the Justice Department from soliciting or encouraging foreign governments to engage in antitrust against U.S. companies defending themselves against antitrust suits filed by the U.S. government here at home. My amendment is narrow in scope. It was carefully drafted to ensure that it is not overreaching. 
It will simply ensure that Joel Klein and his staff at the Antitrust Division do not travel abroad at the expense of U.S. taxpayers for the purpose of encouraging foreign governments to attack successful U.S. businesses. 
I assure my colleagues that I am very disappointed that this amendment is necessary at all. That U.S. government officials in this Administration are engaged in practices that serve no other purpose than to harm U.S. companies, their employees, their families of their employees, and the small businesses whose livelihoods depend on the success of those companies is truly disheartening. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning the actions of Antitrust Division officials and to pass this important amendment today. Attorney General Reno and Assistant Attorney General Klein need to know that their actions will not go unnoticed and that they cannot continue down their current path of denouncing U.S. businesses overseas.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Transportation Appropriations measure crafted by Senator Shelby. This bill takes a significant step forward in addressing the transportation needs of the nation, and more specifically of Washington state. 
As the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, I am especially pleased with the generous increase in funding for the Airport Improvement Program. The Airport Improvement Program provides valuable grants to fund the capital needs of the nation's commercial airports and general aviation facilities. It allows the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator to fund planning, design, and construction of airport projects directly affecting aircraft operations, including runways, aprons, and taxiways, with the purpose of maintaining a safe and efficient nationwide system of public use airports. 
Adequate funding for AIP is integral to addressing the infrastructure needs of our national aviation system. The GAO estimates that the gap between available funds and projected maintenance and construction costs for airports is almost $3 billion. The $2.1 billion included in this measure for AIP is a significant step toward bridging this gap. As the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, I will continue to look for the best possible way to assist the Appropriations Committee in meeting the infrastructure needs of our aviation system. 
Chairman Shelby also included several aviation related items that will have a positive impact on Washington state's airports. Inclusion of $6 million for the Contract Tower Cost-Sharing Pilot Program is certainly a positive development for my state. This new program, which I am also working on in the context of the FAA reauthorization measure, will allow local airports that fall below the eligibility criteria for the existing program to cost-share with the FAA. The $6 million included by Chairman Shelby will cover cost-sharing arrangements for approximately 30 contract towers across the country. Olympia and Felts Field are the two affected airports in Washington state that will be able to maintain their contract towers and, therefore, not diminish the current level of safety. 
I am pleased that the Chairman included $3 million for the Tactical (Transponder) Landing System. This system was recently certified by the FAA and could provide immense benefit to airports that are surrounded by geographical barriers such as mountainous terrain or approaches over water that render the current Instrument Landing System useless. With the installation of a TLS, Boeing field, whose current approach patterns cause significant noise problems for local residents, will be able to structure much more agreeable landing patterns. Moscow/Pullman airport, which is also named in the bill, should be an excellent test of the effectiveness of a TLS in mountainous terrain. 
I would also like to commend Chairman Shelby for giving priority consideration to Felts Field, Pangborn Field, Paine Field, and Spokane International airports, which all face unique problems that I look forward to working with the FAA to resolve in a safe and timely manner. 
This bill is not only positive for aviation. The Chairman has realized that innovative thinking and problem solving in the transportation field deserves priority consideration. This is demonstrated in the Transportation Planning, Research, and Development account, where the Chairman included two projects in Washington state that will serve as models for communities across the nation. The first is a freight mobility study instigated by the Kent, Washington Chamber of Commerce that will bring together representatives from federal, state, and local governments, as well as the shipping, trucking, and rail industries, along with organized labor, to brainstorm on ways we can make the existing system work better, realizing that we have finite resources with which to improve our aging infrastructure. 
The other Washington state project included in the Transportation Planning, Research and Development account is the Chehalis Basin/I-5 Flooding project. Currently, flooding in the Interstate 5 corridor near Centralia/Chehalis in Washington state seriously compromises freight mobility, with damage and impact estimates of $50-80 million per day. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is currently planning to solve the problem by elevating the freeway for almost three miles. This would be a typical transportation project, but it would also exacerbate the flooding problem in the Chehalis River Basin and have extensive environmental impacts. The plan is estimated to cost $98 million, with funding anticipated from the federal roads allocation to the states. As an alternative, Lewis County is leading a consortium of three counties (with Grays Harbor and Thurston), two cities (Centralia and Chehalis) and the Chebalis Tribe to eliminate the I-5 flooding problem by solving the flooding problem in the upper Chehalis River Basin. Work on this project is well-advanced, and cost estimates range between $60-80 million. I look forward to working with the Chairman to ensure a significant federal contribution to assist in the costly permitting process that will make this common sense alternative solution a reality. 
The Chairman was also very generous in his support for the Regional Transit Authority, which was recently renamed Sound Move. On November 5, 1996, the voters of the Puget Sound region approved this $3.91 billion transportation proposal. Sound Move will increase the capacity of the region's transportation system through a fix of light rail, commuter rail, High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) expressways, regional express bus routes and `community connections' (such as park-and-ride lots and transit centers). Once completed, transit customers will be able to travel throughout a densely populated tri-county region in the state--Pierce, King and Snohomish counties--by local bus, regional bus, light rail and commuter rail, using a single ticket. 
By passing the Sound Move ballot measure, voters in the Puget Sound region agreed to provide the local funding portion of the plan through a .4 percent increase in the local sales tax and a .3 percent increase in the motor vehicle excise tax. These tax revenues will provide a stable, dependable, dedicated source of local revenue for building, maintaining and operating the system. Coupled with revenue collected from bonds and fareboxes, this funding will provide a 62 percent local match for the light rail and commuter rail portions of the project and over 80 percent of the total $3.91 billion project. 
Despite the voters' clear willingness to pay for an improved transportation system, the Regional Transit Authority needs federal financial assistance to successfully implement the light rail and commuter rail portions of this plan. The rail segment of the Sound Move proposal includes: a 25-mile light rail line with 26 stations between Seattle's University District and the City of SeaTac via downtown Seattle and the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport; a 1.6-mile light rail line between downtown Tacoma and the Tacoma Dome train station; and an 81-mile commuter line using existing freight track between Everett and Lakewood with at least 14 stations. 
Mr. President, Sound Move is one of the most cost-effective projects in the nation, with one of the strongest local commitments. In fact, Sound Move ranked Medium/High in all categories in the recently released Department of Transportation FY `99 Report on Funding Levels and Allocation of Funds for Transit Major Capital Investments. These rankings demonstrate the overall strength of the project, which boasts ridership and cost effectiveness estimates that unquestionably rank it among the top new starts in the country. The voters around Puget Sound are eager to join the federal government in making this project a reality and it is my hope that the $60 million included in this measure for the rail component of Sound Move will be supplemented by the full $18 million which was included in the House bill for buses. 
Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank the chairman for crafting a fair measure that adequately funds our national priorities while realizing and addressing the unique transportation problems facing Washington state.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to your attention a project that is of utmost importance to Southwest Washington state, the Chehalis I-5 Flood Control Project. You were gracious enough to include $250,000 for this project in the manager's amendment in full committee, and I would like to thank you for your attention to this matter. Unfortunately, this project, which will ultimately cost taxpayers $18 million less than the initial option proposed by the Washington State Department of Transportation, will require $2.5 million in FY 1999 to wade through the myriad of permits that must be completed before this project can move forward. I would like to work with you in conference to ensure that this project has the Federal support to become a reality.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold yet another hearing designed solely to lob one more grenade at Microsoft. It is entitled `Competition and Innovation in the Digital Age: Beyond the Browser Wars.' 
Just as I have said of the Justice Department's case against Microsoft, the Judiciary Committee's efforts to paint Microsoft in a negative light seems to be merely an attempt to give software companies that cannot compete against Microsoft on their own merits an opportunity to catch up. It is this practice, the practice of using the United States Senate and the Department of Justice as a means to help less successful companies compete against Microsoft, that is unfair--not Microsoft's business practices. 
As all of my colleagues will remember, the Committee held a similar hearing only a few months ago. At that hearing in March, Microsoft's CEO, Bill Gates, patiently answered questions from committee members and witnesses representing his competitors for four hours. The questioning focused primarily on whether Microsoft has the right to integrate new and innovative products into its Windows operating system--specifically, Microsoft's Internet Explorer. 
This is precisely that issue that a gaggle of lawyers over at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division and a dozen state attorneys general are currently litigating. The DOJ and state attorneys general allege that Microsoft, in including its browser software in Windows 98, is in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. 
Only a few weeks after this case was filed, Microsoft won a major court victory in a related battle. On June 23, a three judge United States Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned the preliminary injunction issued against Microsoft last December by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. In my opinion, this ruling is so significant as to make the Department of Justice's current case against Microsoft even more questionable than it was at the time of filing. 
The question before the panel was whether Microsoft violated antitrust law and a 1995 consent decree by integrating its web browser into Windows 95. The panel ruled that Microsoft's actions did not violate the consent decree and that Microsoft should indeed be allowed to integrate new and improved features into Windows. Such integration, the judges ruled, benefits consumers. 
The judges went on to warn that the government is ill-suited to make technological determinations and that the dangers of doing so far outweigh the potential benefits that `antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purpose with antitrust law.' 
The Judiciary Committee's hearing will apparently focus on issues other than the integration of browser software into Windows 98. The witnesses will instead give testimony, among other subjects, alleging that Microsoft competes unfairly in the server operating system market--a market in which Microsoft is one of many competitors and in which no one company is dominant. No monopoly here--what's the beef? 
The network server market includes competitors such as IBM, Sun Microsystems, Novell, Microsoft and several others. Many of these companies have chosen strategic business models in which they sell their customers not only the software that runs network servers, but sometimes the servers themselves, the applications that run on the servers, and even the workstations that sit on employees' desks. In such models, every piece of hardware and 
software is designed to work together, and as long as customers use only that one company's products, everything works fine. 
Sales volumes in the network server market are fairly low but profit margins are high. Once a customer decides to buy a one-company network, he tends to stick with that system because the cost of switching to something else is quite high. Thus, this business model is a good one that can make, and has made, some companies very successful. 
Microsoft has chosen a different business model for the network server market. It's model is not unfair, illegal, or anti-competitive. It is merely a different way of doing business. Microsoft doesn't make hardware or enterprise applications that run on servers. It does not make the workstation computers that sit on employees' desks. Microsoft makes network operating system called Windows NT. For a customer to use Windows NT on its server, it does not need to buy anything else from Microsoft. NT is designed to work with any manufacturer's hardware and support any company's software. It is a high volume, low profit margin model. 
It is certainly not difficult to understand why companies like Novell, Sun, and IBM might be concerned about competition in the server market. After all, they have been in this market for a long time and have done very well in it. Because the margins on their sales are high, lost sales are more damaging to them than they are to their competitors whose margins on each sale are much lower. But if Sun, IBM, and Novell continue to respond to the needs of their customers, they will continue to do well in the server market. 
Just as the appeals panel ruled last month on the browser issue, the decision on whether the business model chosen by Sun, IBM, and Novell or that chosen by Microsoft is a decision best made by the free market and the free market alone. The Department of Justice and the Senate Judiciary Committee have no legitimate role to play in this determination. 
Let me make it clear, Mr. President, that throughout this attack, Microsoft has gone out of its way to cooperate both with the Committee and with the Justice Department. Even while its reputation is being tarnished by these two organizations, Microsoft has provided them both with everything it has been asked to provide and more. 
So, I admonish my friend and colleague Senator Hatch to reciprocate. Given the list of witnesses scheduled to testify, however, I am afraid that the deck is already stacked against Microsoft. That is precisely why I advised Bill Gates to decline an invitation from the Committee to appear at the hearing. Once is enough, Mr. President. The Committee can drag Mr. Gates and his company through the mud if it so choose, but Mr. Gates does not have to be there to validate a travesty.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a recent GAO report concluded that approximately one-third of the U.S. agricultural labor force in the United States is illegal. Many estimate that the percentage is in fact much higher. For too long, Congress has failed to respond to the lack of legal agricultural workers, and simply left on the books, and largely unused, a guestworker program that is too administratively complex and expensive to be workable. With recent crackdowns by INS, our farmers and growers face a labor shortage crisis. Congress must act, and it must act now. 
I rise today, and join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in introducing the Agricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1998, a bill to address this problem. This legislation is long past due and urgently needed. As the Senator from Florida described earlier today, the bill is a win-win-win proposition. It is a win for farmers and growers because it provides them a method of obtaining a legal, reliable workforce. It is a win for workers both domestic and foreign. For domestic workers, the bill, through a work registry, gives them first preference on jobs, benefits above those they are currently receiving, and continued employment by ensuring that American farms remain economically viable and that production is not lost to other countries. For foreign workers, the bill provides the dignity, freedom from fear, and mobility that attends a legal status, as well as significant worker protection and benefits. Finally, the bill is a win for consumers because it ensures them a ready, affordable supply of American agricultural products. I applaud this carefully considered, balanced legislation and will work actively for its quick enactment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I must comment on Senator Grassley's sense-of-the-Senate. While I unequivocally support many of the provisions within the amendment, I must voice my concern over the provision regarding extending most-favored-nation trading status to China. 
For more than 20 years, the Pacific Northwest has been unable to break China's ban on our wheat. In addition, China has consistently barred imports of our apples and other high quality commodities. With these obvious barriers to American agriculture, I question the wisdom of extending MFN to China when it refuses to open its agricultural markets to our produce. 
I have serious reservations regarding extending MFN status for China, but because of the dire situation facing the family farm in America, I will support Senator Grassley's sense-of-the-Senate.

At a time when Joel Klein has been complaining that his division does not have enough money or people to do its job effectively, he and his staff are traveling around the world on the Justice Department's dime. And they are using those foreign visits as a bully pulpit to tout the merits of their case against Microsoft and to encourage foreign governments to join in the attack. 
This activity is reprehensible. It is even more egregious when one notes that it is being financed by the American people--many of whom may wind up losing their jobs and their livelihoods if Joel Klein is successful. 
We need some answers, Mr. President. Does the Attorney General consider such activities on the part of the Antitrust Division legitimate? Is Joel Klein working on behalf of U.S. taxpayers or against them? How much is the antitrust division spending to send its employees around the world? Which foreign competitors have benefited? 
Here is the evidence my colleagues have compiled to date: 
Joel Klein visited Japan to meet with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission last December. A month later, the Trade Commission raided Microsoft's Tokyo offices, confiscating thousands of company documents. 
When Russell Pittman went to Brazil in May, he spoke publicly to senior Brazilian government officials responsible for antitrust enforcement in that country, outlining the Justice Department's case against Microsoft in detail. Nine days later, the Brazilian government announced its intention to begin legal proceedings against the company. 
A quote from Mr. Pittman at this event is particularly troubling, and, I might add, somewhat ironic. He accused Microsoft of behaving `like an arrogant monopolist, even acting arrogantly in its relations with the antitrust authorities. It 
will receive from these agencies what it deserves.' Who is calling whom arrogant? A Government bureaucrat on a taxpayer-funded jaunt to Brazil? If the situation were not so serious, I would find this quote to be quite ironic, Mr. President. 
In Israel in May, Dan Rubinfeld gave a public speech on the department's case against Microsoft to an audience that included Israeli public officials responsible for antitrust enforcement. He later met privately, along with his sidekicks from the Federal Trade Commission, with a group of Israeli Government officials to outline the Department of Justice's complaint against Microsoft. 
Not surprisingly, the Israeli Government is now in discussions with Microsoft concerning its business practices in that country. 
And finally, on June 8, Douglas Melamed briefed the OECD's Competition Law and Policy Committee in Paris on the strengths of the department's case against Microsoft. The OECD Committee includes officials from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Brazil. 
I applaud Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl for bringing this issue to light, Mr. President. It is just one in a series of steps by the administration to tie the hands of successful U.S. companies. 
The American people deserve to know how and why the administration is using their money and why thousands of jobs in my home State of Washington and across the United States are being put on the line by a contemptuous group of bureaucrats over at the Justice Department. 
I demand that Attorney General Reno do right and answer the questions raised by my colleagues promptly and completely. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee responsible for funding the National Park System's annual budget and as a long time resident of Washington State--home to some of the true crown jewels of the system, I have long held both a personal and professional interest in ensuring that our parks are adequately funded and well maintained. 
Unfortunately in recent years due to declining budgets, more units added to the system, and substantial increases in visitation, our park system faces some serious challenges. All told, the total unfunded backlog in maintenance, resource stabilization, infrastructure repair and employee housing alone is a staggering $8.7 billion. 
While I have done everything I can to ensure that the National Park Service receives annual increases at a time when overall funding for the Department of Interior continues to decline, the fact is new, innovative ideas are imperative to overcome this desperate situation. For this reason, I have promoted such ideas in my Interior Appropriations bill. 
One idea that was incorporated into our bill during the 104th Congress was the establishment of the recreation fee demonstration program. Under this three-year pilot program, individual units of the National Park and National Forest systems that charge an additional entry fee get to keep 80% of the receipts collected from that fee within the park or forest unit to help address the backlog of operational and maintenance needs. 
The user fee program is designed to give each unit more authority over the resources needed to maintain facilities, to repair roads and other areas in need of up keep. While nobody likes higher fees, I have long believed that the public is willing to pay more to visit these national treasures if it could be assured that such increases went to addressing critical needs at the parks they visited. The recreation fee demonstration program is a small, but positive step forward in this direction. 
More recently, I have gotten behind the ideas and efforts of Senator Craig Thomas, Chairman of the authorizing subcommittee on national parks. Senator Thomas recently developed a comprehensive and forward thinking proposal to reinvigorate the park system. In addition to making my Recreation Fee Demonstration Program permanent and extending it to all units of the National Park System, Senator Thomas' proposal which passed the Senate last month contains a number of reforms which would improve overall services at our parks and hopefully generate more revenue. I am pleased to have supported Senator Thomas in this effort both as a fellow member of the Senate Energy Committee and on the Senate floor. 
In addition to my colleagues and my own ideas, I am also relying on the suggestions of the recreation community in my state of Washington which is home to the Olympic, Mount Ranier, and North Cascades National Parks. Recently, I was approached by Mr. John Taylor, a constituent of mine from the Seattle area, who came up with a thoughtful--albeit narrower proposal--which only furthers the interests of the system. This idea would create a National Park Service magazine similar to that established by the National Smithsonian Institution through its publication of the Smithsonian Magazine.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the time has come to pay the piper, and we don't much like the price. For years we have been able to sing the siren song of sanctions on the cheap. Whenever we are concerned about human rights--sanctions. If we are concerned about nuclear proliferation--sanctions. But I think almost always the magic of those sanctions has been that they don't go into effect when we make the speeches on that subject on the floor; they may happen sometime later. And now they have happened. 
All of us in this body and our predecessors are guilty of this song. But now we learn what it really does. At a time in which farm prices, especially in our wheat country and the Pacific Northwest, are already declining precipitously because of the financial crisis in east Asia, we add to our own pain by creating a situation that will almost certainly cause us to lose hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sales in Pakistan to other countries that don't share our enthusiasm for sanctions, unless we act in a period of time of less than 1 week. 
Yes, this is an urgently needed bill, urgently needed for the farm sector of our community, urgently needed for our own ability to operate in a highly competitive world of agriculture. For that purpose, the work of the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Delaware and everyone else who has been a part of this is vitally important. 
But the Senator from Ohio just said, gosh, this is unbalanced, it does something for Pakistan and it doesn't do anything for India. It did something for India this morning, Mr. President. This morning it did when it also allowed waivers with respect to the Export-Import Bank, where last year we sold almost $400 million worth of aircraft from my State, with future similar sales greatly threatened by sanctions which now remain because the Senators from California and from Ohio wouldn't permit this bill to come up at all unless that was taken out. 
Of course we are going to support the bill in its present form, and of course we will support a task force, and what my seatmate here, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, has been working on for months, to bring a more rational system of sanctions together. But we are finding that the sanctions cost us more than they cost the Nations against whom they are imposed, because you can buy wheat in parts of the world other than the Pacific Northwest. Unfortunately, you can buy jet airliners from other sources than Seattle, WA. In fact, when you impose sanctions on one thing on a country, you give that country an immense incentive to buy other things from other countries, as well as a form of resentment. 
In this case, when the India nuclear tests were largely caused by our policies with respect to China, and of course the Pakistani test by what happened in India, the sanctions are particularly bizarre. 
The sanctions that we are in part removing today should be removed. But they are an illustration of an even bigger fact--that we should have done what this bill did this morning and does not do now; we should be doing even more. So in that respect, the promise in this bill is dual: First, an opportunity, if we do get it all the way through and to the President, that we will save a vitally important part of our wheat sales; and, second, the illustration that we are only at the beginning of deciding that maybe that song wasn't worth the price that we are now paying the piper for. And that may be every bit as important a part as the specific sections we are passing this afternoon, as important as they are.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are about to vote on cloture on a product liability bill, a product liability bill worked out with great care over the course of the last year and a half by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and myself, and the White House, to meet all of the objections contained in the President's veto message on the bill passed on the same subject about 2 years ago. Nevertheless, the demand to party loyalty on the part of the minority leader will almost certainly defeat this vote for cloture. That is highly regrettable as the arguments against it are entirely devoid of merit. 
Just a few minutes ago you heard the junior Senator from New Jersey protest about the fact that cloture would prohibit the bringing of lawsuits based on gun violence. That is entirely specious for two reasons. The first is the amendment on that subject that is at the desk will be germane after cloture and can be debated and voted on. Secondly, and more importantly, the lawsuits by various States against gun manufacturers based on the tobacco litigation are not product liability lawsuits. Tobacco litigation was not a product liability lawsuit at all, and neither are these lawsuits. They simply are not affected by this legislation. 
The real protest was outlined a couple of nights ago by the minority leader who said, `I hope that we have a good debate about how good or bad this legislation is. I hope we have an opportunity to propose amendments to this litigation.' 
Yesterday, about an hour before the time ran out for the filing of amendments, the majority leader came to the floor when only two or so amendments had been filed to ask unanimous consent for further time to put in amendments. The minority leader's representative objected to adding to that time. Nevertheless, there are 38 amendments on the desk on this bill, 28 of them by Democrats, 10 by Republicans. Many of those amendments, including several by the Senator from South Carolina, are germane and can be debated on and voted on after cloture. 
Yesterday afternoon the majority leader offered to extend the time for this vote so that there could be debates on amendments before cloture took place. The minority leader turned down that informal request. In other words, there is no desire on the part of the opponents of this bill to debate amendments to the bill, amendments further restricting it or amendments on any other element of the subject. None whatsoever. It is a simple smokescreen to persuade Members who would otherwise be willing to vote for cloture and vote for the bill not to do so. 
Night before last, other Members on that side of the aisle complained bitterly about their inability to debate totally irrelevant matters to product liability. They mentioned campaign finance laws. We had 2 weeks of debate on that subject. They mentioned tobacco legislation. We debated that subject for 4 weeks. They mentioned education reform. We debated that subject for 2 weeks and passed a bill which has now gone to the President of the United States. And they spoke of health care reform on which they have already rejected offers for debate but will probably accept some next week. 
No, the claim that there has not been an opportunity to debate this legislation is based on one fact and one fact only--the desire to persuade Members who would otherwise vote for this bill to vote against the cloture motion and therefore to kill the bill. They will probably succeed in doing so, and it is a paradox that a bill that is much more narrow than the one passed by a significant majority of Members of this body 2 years ago and vetoed by the President, which now meets all of the requirements of the President, will be opposed by some Members among those who voted for the bill 2 years ago. It is, I regret to say, pure politics and has very little to do with the merits of the bill itself. 
Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and a number of other Senators, myself included, introduced a resolution reaffirming our commitment to the right of self-determination on the part of the people of the Republic of China on Taiwan. We did so in shock at the seeming abandonment of those people by the President of the United States on his trip to mainland China. The resolution was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, and I hope will be reported back favorably and promptly for debate and passage by the Senate of the United States. 
For decades it has been the policy of the United States to call for all of the relationships between the people and government on Taiwan and the People's Republic of China to be peaceful. It has been our policy that the people of Taiwan should be permitted to determine their own future, much of which has now been undercut by President Clinton's overwhelming desire for approval on the part of a still Communist dictatorship in mainland China. 
In fact, Mr. President, on his trip to China and in the policies immediately preceding that trip, the President of the United States has managed to impose sanctions on the world's most populous democracy, India, for its natural reaction to our assistance to the missile capabilities of the People's Republic of China; has managed to impose sanctions on Pakistan which is greatly harmful to the economy of the United States because of Pakistan's natural reaction to India's nuclear test; has insulted and weakened the people of Japan, a long-time and vitally important democratic ally of the United States, by a refusal to visit Japan on this trip to East Asia; and has undercut one of the most vital democracies anywhere in the world, and particularly East Asia on Taiwan. 
As the Washington Post's editors wrote on July 2, and I quote: 
Mr. Clinton has sided with the dictators against the democrats. 
It seems vital to me that we should reaffirm our commitment to the rights of self-determination on the part of the people of Taiwan, and encourage them on the successful path they have now traveled for almost half a century. 
Mr. President, at the end of the Chinese civil war, when the nationalists were left only with an outpost on Taiwan, a group of Chinese began a separate existence with almost no promise of a bright future, poverty stricken on an island that had just emerged from half a century of Japanese imperialism, threatened by the overwhelming armed force of mainland China, without natural resources, with nothing to sustain them but the brilliance and dedication and the hard-working nature of the Chinese people on Taiwan, and an absolute commitment to their own freedom. 
They have been perhaps the most successful example of what can happen to a people who are dedicated to the ideals that have moved the United States since its founding. 
On Taiwan, the Chinese people first created a magnificently successful economy--an economy so successful that to this day they purchase more American goods and services than does all of mainland China, and following immediately upon that economic success the creation of a life and vibrant democratic system of government. Where under such threat in the entire world do we see anything remotely similar? Perhaps in Israel, perhaps in Israel under a similar threat from the outside, but I think, Mr. President, nowhere else in the world have we seen such a magnificent success in the building of a free and successful economy and a free and successful democracy. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that it should be our policy in the future that we laud and support that degree of success, 
that we encourage the Chinese on the mainland to follow that example rather than impliedly tell the people in Taiwan they must follow the example of the mainland. 
We as Americans simply cannot abandon those free people on Taiwan. We must clearly indicate to mainland China that it cannot attempt to solve its differences with them by the use of force. We must clearly indicate to mainland China that the people of Taiwan must be in charge of determining their own future. We can, of course, hope for one China, but a one China that has institutions and is created in a fashion that respects the views, the desire for continued freedom, on the part of the people of Taiwan. 
How it is that we have managed because of deterioration in our relationship with four democratic nations in east and south Asia without gaining anything of substance, of any real substance in our relationship with China, is beyond my power to explain. But at this point a mild resolution totally consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act passed by this Senate, reaffirming our support for the freedom and rights of self-determination of the people of Taiwan, is, I believe, the minimum we can do to make up for the disastrous remarks of President Clinton on his trip to China. 
I repeat, I hope that the Foreign Relations Committee will report this bipartisan resolution promptly, that it will be passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Only in that fashion can we show our dedication for the cause of a country that has followed our leadership, adopted our ideals, and deserves our support.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, is the business before the Senate the motion to proceed to S. 648? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gorton-wa-2-19980707</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, S. 648 is a bill relating to product liability reported about 1 year ago by the Senate Commerce Committee. That bill is identical or nearly identical to the product liability legislation that passed both Houses of Congress in the last Congress and was vetoed by President Clinton. 
As and when the motion to proceed is agreed to, Senator Rockefeller and I will propose an amendment in the nature of a substitute on the same subject, product liability, somewhat more modest in scope than the bill that was vetoed by the President. It is the result of more than 1 year of careful and detailed negotiation involving myself, other members of this party, Senator Rockefeller and various of his allies, and the Office of the President of the United States. 
The willingness of the President of the United States to sign a product liability bill in the form of this substitute is due to the untiring and diligent efforts of the junior Senator from West Virginia, who has literally been tireless in pursuing a solution to a question that involved his time and my time for well over a decade, and a willingness to pursue it in a White House from which a veto emanated almost 2 years ago. 
The bill, of course, is not as broad as the one that was then vetoed or the bill that was passed out by the Commerce Committee. Nevertheless, it does bring a significant degree of rationality and predictability to product liability litigation. It removes a number of severe inhibitions that stand in the way of research and development for new and approved products in the commerce of the United States. That may be its most important single feature, because we have an economy in which litigation has provided a severe inhibition to the improvement of our products, to the development of new products. Perhaps the single most vivid illustration of the value of product liability litigation is in the field of piston-driven aircraft, a subject with which the Presiding Officer is more than familiar, 
where a limitation on product liability litigation, a modest limitation, passed half a dozen years ago, has resulted in the recovery of an industry that had almost disappeared in the United States of America. So we are not speaking about a theory when we talk about the inhibitions placed on various forms of business enterprise, industrial and otherwise, by the present state of the law varying from State to State through 50 States and several other jurisdictions. 
While I would prefer broader product liability legislation, and while I believe the Senator from West Virginia might prefer it to be somewhat broader than it is at this point, this legislation nevertheless is good for the economy of the United States, and it is good for those who are injured by the actual or real negligence of manufacturers or sellers. It does, however, say that in the case of the seller, the seller is only going to be liable when the seller itself is negligent. It does put some rational basis on the award of punitive damages with an actual cap on punitive damages for modest and for small businesses. In that regard, it sets a uniform national standard for punitive damages in those States that allow punitive damages--my own, for example, does not--raising the bar to require clear, cogent, and convincing evidence for the award of punitive damages, a higher standard than exists in most States at the present time, with a cap on punitive damages for small businesses. 
The National Federation of Independent Business has just come out with a study as to who is impacted by that, and while the definition of a small business in this bill is 25 employees or $5 million a year in sales, their table shows that 73 percent of all the manufacturers in the United States have fewer than 20 employees, 88 percent of all the retailers in the United States have fewer than 20 employees, and 85 percent of the wholesalers in the United States fall within the same category. So, for the vast majority of business enterprises in the United States, there will be a cap on punitive damages that is realistic in nature and is something that the business might conceivably be able to pay, rather than simply being driven out of business by such a verdict. 
With respect to product sellers, it simply states that the product seller avoids liability if the product seller is not itself negligent or otherwise liable. Manufacturers, under those circumstances--since they can't be joined in litigation with the product seller--can almost always achieve what amounts to fraudulent joinder and thus get diversity of citizenship, a diversity of citizenship that allows them to get into a Federal court rather than into State courts where the great majority of notorious and unwarranted verdicts in product liability cases have taken place in the past. 
Product manufacturers have been frustrated by the unavailability of a `misuse' defense. They have that, to a greater extent, as a result of this bill. The bill includes a statute of repose, a very modest and narrow statute of repose but a statute of repose nevertheless, one of 18 years for durable goods used in the workplace where the plaintiff already has available to that plaintiff workers compensation or industrial insurance. 
Finally, a strong biomaterials bill, particularly important, in my view, as the materials that go into implants--for example, heart monitors and the like--are often very inexpensive. They are various forms of plastic tubing and the 
like. Yet the biomaterials manufacturer almost always finds itself as a defendant in a product liability suit directed primarily at the manufacturer or the assembler of the implant. And the cost, in the case of many relatively large corporations, of successfully defending lawsuits based on those implants literally exceeds the total sales price of the materials that they have sold that go into those items. So a rational manufacturer of the materials that go into various very important cutting-edge medical devices--the rational manufacturer simply won't sell them. There is not much point in selling $100,000 worth of materials in a year if it is going to cost you $1 million a year successfully to defend yourself against lawsuits directed primarily at the person who has used the materials that you have manufactured. 
Some of those companies have continued in the business just as a matter of being good citizens, but we cannot call on them or believe that they will continue to do so for an extended period of time. To the best of our knowledge, we do not have any who have actually lost these lawsuits, but the defense against these lawsuits is important in any event. 
We have a system that is sick, a system in which the greater percentage of the money that goes into product liability litigation goes to lawyers, insurance companies, insurance agents and the like, and only a relatively modest portion of it ever gets to the actual victims of actual negligence. We have a situation in which there are highly publicized and outrageously large punitive damage awards in a handful of States of the United States, but where, in the vast majority of cases in which some at least modest compensation is due, the compensation is less than actual damages. 
This bill is a modest attempt to improve the compensation system for defective products in the United States and it modestly improves it. It is a modest move in the direction of uniformity. It certainly doesn't create uniformity everywhere, but at least it is a modest step in that direction. And it is a significant step in the direction of encouraging companies to continue to be at the cutting edge of the development of new products, new products used both in the workplace and by individuals all across the United States--the kind of innovation and development which have marked the United States from the very beginning of our history and of our economy, and the kind of innovation and leadership in the world economy that is vitally important. So I hope we will be soon able to move to the bill, to pass the bill in the form as it has been worked out by the Senator from West Virginia and myself with the cooperation of the White House, its passage by the House, and its signing by the President of the United States. 
I dare not say in a body like this that this issue has occupied us for more years than any other in which there has not been any actual legislation passed, but if it doesn't rank No. 1 in that score, it ranks very, very close to No. 1. We now have a real opportunity, if we are constructive, to see to it that we are modestly successful, and I hope in the course of the next week or 10 days that is exactly what we will do.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this Senator is puzzled, truly puzzled, by the remarks which he has just had the privilege of hearing. The minority leader protests that we cannot have a debate on product liability because cloture has been filed on this substitute amendment. He is joined by one of the supporters of the bill, the senior Senator from Connecticut, who evidently wants a debate on product liability. 
But it is overwhelmingly evident from the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Illinois, and the responses to those remarks on the part of the minority leader, that they do not have the slightest interest in a debate on product liability--not the slightest interest in a debate on product liability. 
They want a debate on their agenda. And they want a debate on their agenda whether it has already occupied weeks of the Senate's time or not, whether they have already been offered a debate on that agenda or not in a reasonable time, at which they could be taken up as individual matters. 
No. The net result, Mr. President, of the remarks of the minority leader is that they wish the right, at any time and under any set of circumstances, to set the agenda of the Senate, the subject matter that the Senate will be debating, and they want to engage in that agenda not once, not twice, but on an unlimited basis whenever they wish to bring it up. 
The Senator from Illinois implied, at least, that he wanted another debate on what he calls `campaign reform,' on a proposal blatantly unconstitutional, a proposal clearly violating the free speech guarantees in the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, a debate which the Senate had for more than 2 weeks and a debate which the Senator from Illinois and the minority leader lost--lost only after threatening a filibuster themselves against any campaign reform advocated by a majority of the Members on this side, campaign reforms based on seeing to it that individuals did not have to contribute to campaigns with which they did not agree, campaign reform based on bringing light into the source of the kind of money that so devastated and discredited the Presidential election of 1996. 
Then the Senator from Illinois, and I believe the Senator from Massachusetts, spoke about tobacco legislation. Tobacco legislation, Mr. President? Does my memory fail me? Did we not debate tobacco legislation for the better part of 4 weeks on a bill relating to tobacco? I believe that we did. And I believe that the positions taken by most of the Members on the other side of the aisle ended up unsuccessful. And so what have we had since then? Four weeks is not enough? 
Immediately thereafter, they attempted to redebate tobacco on another issue important to the people of the United States. They have now destroyed the debate on a bill for the support of the Department of Agriculture and all of our agricultural across the United States by insisting that we can't debate agriculture for 2 days and pass a bill without having another 4, 6 or 8 weeks on their tobacco agenda. 
The Senator from Illinois says that nothing was done with respect to education. I seem to remember at least a week, maybe 2 weeks, debating the subject of reform of education in the United States. In fact, I believe it was just 2 weeks ago that we passed a bill on that subject and sent it to the President who has determined that he will veto. This Senator proposed to this body a true reform in the way in which we deal with education, one that would have trusted our State education officials, our local education officials, our teachers and our parents to make decisions about the education of their children without the constant interference of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, who impose more than half of the rules regulating the conduct in our schools, while coming up with 7 or 8 percent of the money. Not a single Member on that side of the aisle was willing to vote for that proposal, and they said the entire education reform bill would be filibustered to death if it were included in any bill sent to the President of the United States. 
Oh, no, Mr. President, we have debated education reform. We have passed in this body true education reform. I don't think at this point that there is much point in going over it again. 
Here today we were debating a vitally important appropriations bill for veterans, for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. We had a thoughtful debate, dividing both parties on the space station. We were about to debate mortgage limitations and do the business of the Senate when the minority leader says, oh, no; we are not going to let the majority of the Appropriations Committee go through an appropriations bill. We will debate our proposal for health care changes, and we will do it right now. 
Now, he did that in spite of the fact that when I was sitting in your seat as the acting President of the Senate, the majority leader 3 weeks ago came down here and offered a full opportunity to the minority to debate their health care proposals together with our health care proposals and to have direct votes on those proposals before the end of this month of July 1998. That offer was totally rejected by the very people who now demand we engage in that debate today as a part of an important bill on a totally and completely different subject.

Mr. GORTON. No, the Senator will not yield. The Senator will not yield. 
So this Senate has debated a change in our campaign reform laws. It has debated education reform and passed a bill on the subject. It has debated tobacco legislation. And it is more than willing and will debate health care legislation with the proposals of both parties considered in that connection. 
But no majority party, no majority leader, has ever permitted a set of circumstances under which the minority not only determines the agenda, but when the agenda is to be debated and how many times it is to be debated, even though that prevents a debate on vitally important appropriations bills for the conduct of the government, and in this case a debate on an important product liability bill. As the manager of that bill, had the minority leader said we would like to do what we did just 2 years ago and have a debate and several amendments about product liability, the way that the senior Senator from Connecticut was speaking about the subject a few moments ago, I have no doubt that that desire would be granted. I have no doubt that proposed changes in the substitute bill that is now before the Senate would have been debated. I think those proposed changes would have been defeated. 
Two years ago this Congress did spend, I think, a full week or more on a much broader and more all-encompassing product liability bill. It was debated then by the minority party as a product liability bill without the attempt to move on to a totally and completely unrelated subject. It was passed. It was sent to the President of the United States for reasons that this Senator did not consider to be particularly persuasive. The President of the United States vetoed that bill. 
Then the junior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, and I worked diligently for almost 2 years in coming up with a bill to be proposed here on that subject with which the President of the United States would agree and with which the President of the United States does agree. We are now told that an attempt actually to debate that subject and to vote on this bill is somehow or another an infringement on the rights of the minority party. 
I heard during the course of the last week over this, the minority party does want one change in the bill on product liability having to do with guns. That amendment, I am informed by the Parliamentarian, will be germane after cloture. It can be debated and it can be voted upon. For all practical purposes, any limitation of an already modest bill on product liability can be debated and voted upon after cloture. It is difficult to persuade this Senator that anyone on this side of the aisle wants to expand this product liability bill and cause it to cover a greater field related to product liability than it does at the present time. 
That was the pretense set forth in the initial remarks of the minority leader, that he wishes a fuller and more complete debate on product liability. But that pretense was shattered instantly by the Senators who asked him to yield to questions and simply stated, and I repeat it again, that they wanted to debate subjects totally unrelated to product liability. Three of the four subjects they mentioned have already been debated at length on the floor of this Senate and decided--decided in a way they don't like--but decided pursuant to the rules of the Senate of the United States. 
The fourth will clearly be debated, will be debated on its own merits, and will be debated at a time at which both the members of the minority party and the members of the majority party can set forth their proposals and have the merits of their proposal both fully debated and determined and decided under the rules of the Senate. 
This artificial fury that we have listened to here for most of the last hour is directed partly at party politics and partly as a highly skillful way of destroying a product liability bill to which the President of the United States, the leader of their party, has agreed. It may well be successful. The Senator from Connecticut is right if he refuses to support a bill that he has supported through his entire career because it won't also carry debates on campaign laws, health care, education, and tobacco, then unfortunately all of the work of which he was a part, and the Senator from West Virginia was a part, and many of us were a part of on this side, and the President of the United States was a part, may be wasted. 
I think that may very well be the goal of those who engage in this artificial outrage about whether or not we should deal with product liability for a few days and debate that issue, finish it, have a vote on it, finish our appropriations bills, have votes on each of them, and deal with a health care debate before the end of this month. That only is the desire of the majority leader in the normal management of the Senate, just as it was the desire under identical circumstances when the majority leader was on the other side of the aisle. 
It is probably a more open debate on issues of interest to the minority than I could remember during the course of Congresses in which my party was in the minority. But this rhetoric this afternoon here has little, if anything, to do with product liability, or a debate on this product liability bill, or attempts to improve or to amend this product liability bill with product liability provisions. It has to do with the demand of the minority leader that he determine not only the agenda, not only the subjects that the Senate will debate, but the length of time that debate will take, the number of times the debates on particular subjects will be taken. 
The Senate cannot operate under those sets of circumstances. It ought not to operate under those circumstances. I have little hope for those who simply oppose any legal reform whatsoever, even when the President has agreed to it. I do hope that those who believe in product liability, those who were on the other side on each of the three issues that have already been debated, and those who will have the opportunity to debate health care when they wish to do so, will have the courage to see to it that we are able to debate this product liability bill and reach a conclusion on it in a reasonable period of time, so that we can go on to other subjects that are of importance to the Senate and to the American people.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues Senators Lieberman, Faircloth, Harkin, and Boxer to introduce legislation that will build on current scientific advances in understanding autism and will promote additional research in this promising field. Many think autism is rare. In fact, it is the third most prevalent childhood disability, affecting an estimated four hundred thousand Americans and their families. It is also a condition that doctors and scientists believe can be cured. It is not something that we simply must accept. 
When people think of autism they might remember the character played by Dustin Hoffman in the movie `Rainman.' Yet autism has many faces; it affects people from every background, social and ethnic category. Children with autism may be profoundly retarded and may never learn to speak, while others may be extremely hyperactive and bright. Some may have extraordinary talents, such as an exceptional memory or skill in mathematics. However, all share the common traits of difficulty with communication and social interaction. And for reasons we do not yet understand, eighty percent of those with autism are males. 
But autism is not about statistics or medical definitions--it is about children and families. The Kruegers, from Washington state, have an all too typical story. Their little girl Chanel developed like any other child--she happily played with her parents, took her first steps, learned some of her first words and then she started to regress. In four short months, by the time she was two, Chanel had become almost completely enveloped in her own private world. Chanel's mother told me `it was like somebody came in the middle of the night and took my child.' 
Like many children with autism, the Krueger's daughter no longer responded when her parents called her name; words she once spoke clearly became garbled; and socializing became more and more difficult. Fortunately, due to her parents dedication and intervention Chanel Krueger at age 5, is doing remarkably well. 
But, many autistic children completely lose the ability to interact with the outside world. The hours these kids should be spending in little league or playing with their friends are often spent staring out the window, transfixed by the dust floating in the sunlight or the pattern of leaves on the ground. 
Even today, with advances in therapy and early intervention, few of these children will go to college, hold a regular job, live independently or marry. More than half never learn how to speak. 
The facts about autism can be sobering--but there is hope. Early intervention and treatment has helped many children. Science has also made great strides in understanding this disorder. We now know that autism is a biological condition, it is not an emotional problem and it is not caused by faulty parenting. Scientists believe that autism is one of the most heritable developmental disorders and is the most likely to benefit from the latest advances in genetics and 
neurology. Once the genetic link is discovered, the opportunitis for understanding, treating, and eventually curing autism are endless. 
The promise of research is exactly why I am introducing this legislation and my colleague Representative Jim Greenwood has introduced similar legislation in the House. This bill will increase the federal commitment to autism research. Its cornerstone is authorization for five Centers of Excellence where basic researchers, clinicians and scientists can come together to increase our understanding of this devastating disorder. 
I also want to encourage the collaboration beginning to take place between the various Institutes at the HIH conducting autism research. The bill formalizes the current autism coordinating committee and includes a mechanism to ensure public input. 
While we are hoping to advance our understanding and treatment of autism through research, it is also important that pediatricians and other health professionals have the most current information so that children and their families can receive help as early as possible. The bill includes authorization for an Autism Awareness Program to educate doctors and other health professionals about autism. 
Finally, the bill includes a provision to fund a gene and brain tissue bank developed from families affected with autism to be available for research purposes. This library of genetic information should be a valuable tool for researchers trying to identify the genetic basis for the disorder. 
While the focus of this bill is on autism, advances in this area are also likely to shed light on related problems such as attention deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and various seizure disorders and learning disabilities. 
Research is the key to unlocking the door and freeing those with autism from the isolation and loneliness of their private world. This bill is intended to give the NIH the resources to take advantage of the tremendous opportunity before us to find more effective treatments and ultimately a cure for autism. The promise is real. Fulfillment of that promise only requires our commitment. I urge my Senate colleagues to support this important investment in the future of our children and our Nation.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my colleague, the senior Senator from Utah came to the Senate floor earlier today to continue his lonely and increasingly unsuccessful battle against Microsoft. His statement comes one day after the successful release of Microsoft's latest operating system software, Windows 98, and only three days after Microsoft won a major victory in a ruling by a three-judge panel of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
Senator Hatch said this morning that he is disappointed that Microsoft `has regrettably seen fit to deploy a massive PR campaign, as opposed to engaging the American public on the basis of the facts and the merits.' 
I find Senator Hatch's comments interesting, given that the appeals court panel took a long hard look at the very facts that Senator Hatch and the Department of Justice claim Microsoft is hiding and ruled that Microsoft's integration of Internet Explorer in Windows 95 is not a violation of U.S. antitrust law or of the 1995 consent decree. The ruling is significant because it covers the same issue that is the central focus of the Justice Department's current case against Microsoft--whether Microsoft can innovate by integrating new products, namely Internet Explorer, into Windows 98. 
The Senator from Utah and the Department of Justice would have barred Windows 98 in its present form, frustrating millions of potential customers and imposing a major roadblock--the first major roadblock--in the way of the continuing triumph of American technology in this most cutting edge of all of our industries. 
So Senator Hatch, instead, announced that his Judiciary Committee will examine those facts even further, in the hope, apparently, of finding something that the appeals court missed, 
or, as he explains in his statement, of finding a new issue with which to attack Microsoft. 
The proper course of action would be precisely the opposite--the abandonment by both the Department of Justice and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee of an unsuccessful and wrongly directed crusade against the advancement of American technology. 
I believe we are now relatively assured that the Department of Justice will not get the extra $7 million above the President's budget request that it asked for to pursue just this course. These actions are a waste of the taxpayers' money and represent the use of the taxpayers' money for the pursuit of private antitrust remedies which, if they are appropriate at all, should be financed by the competitors who seek them. 
Regrettably, Mr. President, Senator Hatch and the Department of Justice are little interested in the facts or merits of the case but purely interested in bringing the most successful software company in the Nation to its knees, so that less successful, less competitive companies, that do not have the ability to succeed on their own, can do so with the help of the Clinton administration's Justice Department aided and abetted by the senior Senator from Utah. 
Senator Hatch also discussed the release of a paper this week by the Software Publisher's Association attacking Microsoft's server business. Interestingly enough, this paper was released just 10 days after Microsoft's biggest competitor in the server business, Sun Microsystems, joined the Association. 
The SPA paper claims that Microsoft is attempting to leverage its market dominance in desktop computer operating systems to gain control of the market for network servers with Windows NT. 
Mr. President, Windows NT has enjoyed great success because it offers the price and performance Microsoft's customers demand. Microsoft Windows NT and the PC model have enabled a new generation of lower-priced computing for businesses worldwide. In fact, a recent study by the Business Research Group found that corporate systems based on Windows NT Server cost 52 percent less than comparable systems from Microsoft's biggest competitor. 
It is not rocket science to determine that Microsoft's success is due to its ability to provide high performance software at low prices. That Senator Hatch and Microsoft's competitors represented by the Software Publishers Association want the American people to believe that Microsoft should be punished for providing consumers want at prices consumers like is to turn the public interest on its head. 
Senator Hatch and the Justice Department are fighting a losing battle, but in the process, are trampling on an American principle I and millions of Americans like me hold dear. That principle is that the free market economy, where innovation and unhindered competition have made this country the most successful economy in the world, 
should continue untrammeled by either Senator Hatch or the Clinton Justice Department.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to speak as eloquently as I possibly can in favor of this proposal. The genius and the persistence of the Senator from Georgia in bringing this major educational reform this far is to be commended highly. 
I feel a particular attachment to this bill because with the help of the Senator from Georgia, while it was being debated before the Senate, there was added to it my own triple option, an opportunity to let each State decide whether or not it would continue to get its Federal aid to education in the present fashion, as a block grant to the State without Federal regulations, or as a block grant directly to school districts without either State or Federal regulations, trusting the people who provide education to their children--teachers, principals and elected school board members. 
Because that is a relatively new idea and highly controversial, its inclusion in this bill would have frustrated our ability to pass this bill and send it to the President. It was, therefore, with my reluctant consent, dropped from the bill that is before us at the present time. 
But the perfect should not ever be the enemy of the good, and the work that has gone into this proposal, the fact that it is highly bipartisan, the fact that there is a real opportunity that it should become law makes it one of the most important bills and the most important debates that we have engaged in in the State so far this year. 
So I thank my friend from Georgia, congratulate him on his good work and commend to all of my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, this important educational reform. 
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not believe that there has been any more successful and imaginative policy with respect to our military preparedness than the three base-closing rounds that were created by a law imagined by the now majority leader of the House of Representatives, a major contribution to a rational system--at least, Mr. President, a rational system until the last base closure round when, in spite of the fact that everyone felt that this issue had been taken out of politics, the President of the United States poisoned the well by totally politicizing the base-closure process. 
The Senator from Virginia, I think, wisely voted against another base-closure process presided over by this President. I agreed with that proposition on the basis that once again it would become a part of the Presidential campaign in the year 2000, and I will not vote for another such process until we can be guaranteed that we will take it out of politics. 
I am going to vote for the amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma perhaps for the same reason that the Senator from Virginia is going to vote against it. I am going to vote to emphasize even more forcefully that he has my bitter disappointment in the way in which this important process was politicized. And I think we need to send a message, yes, even to the Department of Defense that we will not permit that kind of thing to happen in the future. And this, it seems to me, is a pretty good way to send that message. 
I wish I could have voted this year for another base-closing round. I cannot because of what happened during the course of the last Presidential election, and I will support the Senator from Oklahoma because I think he makes that point even more forcefully.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday a three judge United States Appeals Court panel overturned the preliminary injunction issued against Microsoft last December by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. This ruling by the Appeals Court is a major victory for Microsoft and its supporters. In fact, in my opinion, it is so significant as to make the Department of Justice's current case against Microsoft even more dubious than it was at the time of filing. 
The basic question before the panel was whether or not Microsoft violated antitrust law and a 1995 consent decree by integrating its web browser, Internet Explorer, into its Windows 95 operating system. The panel ruled that Microsoft's actions did not violate the consent decree and that Microsoft should indeed be allowed to integrate new and improved features into Windows because such integration benefits consumers. 
The Department of Justice has just suffered a major defeat. 
The ruling comes only a few weeks after the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice filed a new case against Microsoft alleging anticompetitive behavior. The central point of the new case is Microsoft's integration of the Internet Explorer into Windows 98. 
In the new case, the Department of Justice wants Microsoft either to remove Internet Explorer from Windows 98 or add a competing browser from rival Netscape into that Windows 98 program. Department of Justice lawyers claim that Internet Explorer is a separate product and that its integration into Windows 98 is a violation of antitrust law. Interestingly enough, there are other browser manufacturers, smaller than Netscape, who don't seem to have Department of Justice's ear or sponsorship. 
But in the opinion issued yesterday by the Appeals Court panel, the judges ruled that Microsoft's product integration meets the court's requirement that product innovation bring benefits to consumers. The panel calls Microsoft's software design `genuine integration' and rules that the inclusion of Internet Explorer in Window's 95 is not a violation of the consent decree. 
Further, the panel wrote that, `Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust law.' 
It is quite clear from this ruling that the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia believes that Microsoft is not violating the law by integrating Internet Explorer into its operating system software. That integration is beneficial to consumers and any attempt to stifle such innovations is harmful to consumers. 
I see very little difference between the new case and the case just rejected by the Appeals Court. It is time for the Department of Justice to pick up its marbles and go home, Mr. President.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Senator Thurmond, and the other managers of this bill, for agreeing to a modest amendment of my own in their bill. They and their staffs have been most helpful in this effort. 
That amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the Navy to take immediate action to control oil spills from Naval vessels at U.S. ports. This amendment is the result of a discouraging performance by the navy in my home state of Washington this year. There have been six significant oil spills from Naval vessels in Puget Sound in 1998. In my opinion, that is six spills too many. 
The Puget Sound is the jewel of Washington. With Mount Rainer to the east and the Olympic Peninsula to the West, Puget Sound is one of the most beautiful places in the state, and in my admittedly biased opinion, in the country. Tourists and recreationists alike enjoy sailing, fishing, and ferry rides on the Sound. The Sound is home to abundant marine life. Thousands of people in Washington are dedicated to keeping Puget Sound clean so that its magnificence can be enjoyed by generations to come. 
So, Mr. President, I am disturbed when the carelessness of Naval personnel on vessels docked in the Sound for repairs at the Naval Shipyard in Bremerton or Naval Station Everett pollutes that beautiful body of water. Six oil spills in as many months is a poor record by any standard. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing the Navy to take immediate steps to curb the number of oil spills caused by Naval personnel in U.S. waters. More attention to the risk of oil spills, more training to teach Naval personnel how to avoid spills, and improved liaison with local communities where spills occur should go a long way to improve the Navy's environmental record. Oil spills, Mr. President, can and should be limited. 
I thank the Armed Services Committee, the bill managers and their staffs for working with me to pass this important amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business on two additional subjects.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony on Tuesday from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, Joel Klein. The hearing was called to discuss the economic impacts of the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions and the role of federal antitrust enforcers in today's economy. 
While the subject matter was narrow, nothing less than the future of the American economy is at stake in the debate between those in this nation who believe in the power and efficiency of the free market and those who advocate government control of the market. 
Both sides in the debate, and both witnesses at the hearing, claim to be working toward the same goals: consumer protection, competition, and economic expansion. But the contrast in the means each side advocates to achieve those ends is astonishing. 
Alan Greenspan, arguably one of the most powerful men in the world, urged `humility' on the part of government antitrust enforcers, while Joel Klein pushed for more government intervention and more taxpayer money for his division at the Department of Justice. 
Once again Mr. President, I find the attitude of the Clinton/Gore Administration's Justice Department disturbing. It is quite apparent to this Senator that Joel Klein and his staff are anti-business, anti-success, and anti-economic growth. 
Mr. Klein pled for more, not less, government control of the economy. In fact, in his testimony Mr. Klein said, `we reject categorically the notion that markets will self-correct and we should sit back and watch.' Instead, Mr. Klein believes the government should control every move of America's most successful and innovative companies in the name of competition and consumer protection. His statement strikes me as an endorsement of the very kind of socialist-style command and control economics embraced by the Soviet Union that led to its collapse, not the free market principles on which the United States economy is based. 
Mr. Greenspan, on the other hand, a long-time champion of the free market, made the case that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been overstepping their bounds recently in predicting how mergers will affect the economy of the future, and in prohibiting mergers on the basis of predictions about that economic future. He said, `I would like to see far more firm roots to our judgments as to whether particular market positions do, in fact, undercut competition or are only presumed on the basis of some generalized judgment of how economic forces are going to evolve.' Chairman Greenspan went on to point out that, `history is strewn with people making projections which have turned out to be grossly inaccurate.' 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, despite his power to do otherwise, represents and advocates the same common sense approach to competition and consumer welfare as that advocated by our founding fathers. His vision is one in which the government rarely intervenes in the free market that, left alone, can provide more benefits and broader economic wealth for consumers than the smartest government planners and politicians. His vision is one in which American entrepreneurs invent amazing new products and compete openly with one another in a free, but relentless marketplace, to meet the constantly changing demands of consumers. 
It is Mr. Greenspan's vision that has contributed to the greatest economic growth in this nation's history; that of the Justice Department would undermine it. 
In contrast to those of Mr. Greenspan's, Mr. Klein's comments reveal an elitist, government-knows-best approach to economics. Under the guise of consumer protection, Mr. Klein advocates government control of the marketplace in order to prop up businesses that cannot compete successfully on their own. 
I, for one, Mr. President, believe Mr. Greenspan's approach to be correct and to be the one that has and will serve the American consumers and the American economy best. 
As Mr. Greenspan so eloquently put it, `Through skill, perseverance, luck, or political connections, competitors have always pressed for market dominance. It is free, open markets that act to thwart achievement of such dominance, and in the process direct the competitive drive, which seeks economic survival, towards the improvement of products, greater productivity, and the amassing and distribution of wealth. Adam Smith's invisible hand does apparently work.' 
Let us look, for example, at the Justice Department's case against Microsoft--the most successful and innovative company in the U.S. software industry. In this case, the Justice Department argues that Microsoft does not allow computer manufacturers to customize the desktop. Mr. Klein's solution to this problem is for the government to force Microsoft to allow competing desktops to be displayed on Microsoft's own operating system software. 
But only a few weeks after Mr. Klein filed suit against Microsoft on this front, the free market has produced its own solution. A small, start-up software company in Seattle called Pixel has begun marketing a product that makes use of the sliver of black screen space surrounding Microsoft's Windows display on the desktop. Using this empty space, Pixel's software will allow computer manufacturers to display their own control bar. The control bar gives users direct access to web sites chosen by the computer manufacturer. 
In the next few weeks, Packard Bell and NEC will start shipping computers with Pixel's new control bar on the opening screen. 
Compaq Computer has come up with its own alternative. The company announced last week that it will provide a special keyboard with a new range of personal computers that incorporate function keys for instant access to e-mail, news, weather, shopping, and other features. 
Like the Pixel software, this new keyboard enables Compaq to partner directly with Internet publishers and access providers, effectively bypassing Windows. 
These innovations make it clear that the free market works much faster and much more effectively than government intervention. It is a lesson that the Administration and Assistant Attorney General Klein should take to heart. 
Mr. Klein's counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Robert Pitofsky, recently filed a similar case against Intel, another highly successful high tech company that has come under fire for its very success. 
The FTC has charged that Intel, in attempting to protect its own intellectual property, is engaging in anti-competitive business practices. This suit comes at the very time that Intel is facing the toughest competition in the microprocessor market that it has faced in its history as a company. The FTC is as perverse as is the Department of Justice. 
Mr. Greenspan's testimony is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly stifling era of big government intervention in the free market. I urge my colleagues in the United States Senate to heed Mr. Greenspan's words and to join me in my efforts to bring reason back into the debate over antitrust policy.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, every day almost 1,000 Americans suffer from Sudden Cardiac Arrest. It can claim the life of a promising young athlete, a friend or family member regardless of age or health. Sudden Cardiac Arrest occurs when the heart's electrical impulses become chaotic causing the heart to stop pumping blood. Tragically, 95 percent of Americans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrest will die. Today, I am introducing a bill that can change that statistic. 
We know that quick implementation of `Chain of Survival'--calling 911, administering CPR and early access to defibrillation can dramatically improve survival rates for victims of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Unfortunately, early access to defibrillation may be the most critical link in the chain and the most difficult to come by. The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act aims to improve community access to automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), a machine designed to shock the heart and restore its normal rhythm. If every community across America made this easy-to-use technology more readily available, we could increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest and possibly save 250 lives each day and 100,000 lives each year. 
My home state of Washington has a long history of encouraging the use of AEDs. King County, Washington boasts one of the highest cardiac arrest survival rates in the nation at 30 percent--far above the national average survival rate of 5 percent. Communities that have improved survival rates have ensured that Emergency Medical Technicians are trained and equipped with automatic external defibrillators. Some communities have located AEDs in public places like sports stadiums, airports and shopping malls, and others have worked to ensure that police and firefighters, often the first to respond to an emergency, are trained and equipped with AEDs. 
Although the technology is proven effective, access to defibrillators outside the hospital setting is limited. Patient care and survival suffer from a patchwork of different state laws. Less than half of the nation's Emergency Medical Technicians are even trained and equipped to use AEDs. The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act aims to reduce the number of cardiac arrest fatalities by encouraging a uniform system of state laws and to improve current emergency medical training programs. 
The bill asks the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to work on model state legislation that addresses some of the barriers to community access to AEDs such as good samaritan immunity and public placement of these machines. NHLBI will also work with the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration to update the current medical training curriculum to reflect the improvement in technology. The bill will also coordinate a database to collect information on cardiac arrest from existing databases on emergency care. While the bill is far from mandating anything, I am convinced we can reduce the number of cardiac arrest fatalities by encouraging states to train more people to use AEDs right on the scene in a way that the state of Washington is already doing.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader said, what he has proposed now is that instead of dealing with the normal appropriations bills before the Senate, we should go back to a debate which has taken the last 4 weeks of the Senate's time and ignore everything else that is appropriate in the Senate business. 
Last evening, in the last vote, his position fell eight votes shy of getting a necessary budget waiver because of its immense cost to the people of the United States. This proposal, obviously, is equally subject to such a point of order, one that I expect that the majority leader is likely to interpose soon. The result will be identical. In other words, it is simply a frustrating waste of the Senate's time when the Senate ought to be engaged in the business that is before us, and that is the energy and water appropriations bill. 
I share one sentiment with the Democratic leader. I believe that the Senate should pass a bill relating to tobacco. I don't believe that it should be anything like the bill that was before us yesterday, by any stretch of the imagination. But if we are to pass legislation on the subject, it is going to require more understanding and more tolerance of one side to the other than evidenced in the course of the last 3 or 4 weeks. It clearly is not going to be accomplished by the kind of amendment that was placed before the Senate at this point. 
Awaiting further instructions from the majority leader, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the information of all Members, they should understand that this amendment on the part of the Democratic leader does not take us back to where we were yesterday. This is a bill that might best be called Commerce 2. It does not include any of the drug provisions; it does not include a repeal of the marriage penalty; it does not even include the Gregg amendments or the Durbin amendments. It does not include the amendment that was one of mine that was passed to limit attorneys' fees. In effect, this doesn't take us back to yesterday afternoon, it takes us back to 4 weeks ago. I hope that Members will overwhelmingly deny this.

This project will help alleviate a serious flooding problem in Central Washington state. There has been some confusion, however, regarding the Corps of Engineers' involvement in the project. I understand that, because of the water at Rodeo Lake directly affects projects maintained by the Bureau of Reclamation, the committee intends for the Corps to coordinate its efforts with the Bureau of Reclamation.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the energy and water appropriations bill. Senator Reid and I hope that Members who wish to offer amendments to the energy and water bill will come to the floor during today's session to offer and debate their amendments under short time agreements. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible during today's session of the Senate. 
The majority leader would like to remind Members that the Independence Day recess is fast approaching, and therefore the cooperation of all Members will be necessary to make progress on a number of important items, including appropriations bills, any available conference reports, the Higher Education Act, the Department of Defense authorization bill, and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a year ago on Saturday, the attorneys general of most of the States of the United States reached an agreement with the tobacco companies. Those attorneys general understood that in order to have real control over tobacco sales and advertising such an agreement needed to be reached. Members of this body have never understood the fundamental fact that without that agreement, the basic restrictions on advertising, on look-backs, and on the like are blatantly unconstitutional. 
As a result, we have a bill before us that is unconstitutional, steals the money that the States' attorneys general earned for themselves, and provides no incentives for tobacco companies to operate responsibly. 
If we reject it, either we will get out of the hot rhetoric of this body with a small group who came up with a responsible bill, or the States will go ahead themselves. People will be protected. They were protected by the States, in the first place. They will be protected by the States if we fail to act responsibly. This bill is not remotely responsible.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President today I join with Senators Kerrey, Jeffords, and Bumpers, to introduce the Private Use Competition Reform Act of 1998. This legislation provides a fair balance among public financing concerns, principles of fair competition and customer choice in the electric utility industry. At the same time, it strikes an equitable balance between publicly-owned utilities and investor-owned utilities. Most importantly, it advances the interest of consumers. 
The challenge in developing this legislation was to determine the middle ground. Some publicly-owned utilities would like to change the Tax Reform Act of 1986 so that all existing and all future tax-exempt debt would be protected without restrictions. Some investor-owned utilities favor elimination of tax-exempt options for municipal electric utilities, including much of their existing debt. However, this approach would threaten the existence of publicly owned utilities, and raise rates for more than 40 million consumers. 
This bill will accomplish two objectives. First, it clarifies how the existing private-use requirements--the rules that limit the ability of publicly-owned utilities to sell or transport electricity to private parties from facilities financed by tax-exempt bonds--will work in a new competitive marketplace. Secondly, it provides options, with significant tradeoffs, for those utilities that need flexibility and encourages municipalities to open their transmission systems and provide retail choice to consumers. 
There are three categories of debt addressed in this legislation. 
The first consists of existing debt that has been issued for all segments of a public utility's system: generating plants, transmission lines, and local distribution systems. This debt was issued under the assumption that our existing system would not change, and electric utilities would remain closed and not be subject to retail competition. 
The second category of debt pertains to bonds issued after the effective date of the enacted bill and used to finance new generating facilities. There is a compelling argument that this type of debt should not be tax-exempt because power generation, unlike transmission and distribution, is emerging as a competitive market. 
The third category of future debt involves those areas of a utility's system that will not face competition: transmission and local distribution. Since these areas would remain de facto monopolies regulated by FERC or local governments and would be increasingly open to access by all market participants on a non-discriminatory basis, it is appropriate that they should continue to have access to tax-exempt financing. 
This bill addresses each area differently. To enable public power systems to one up their transmission and distribution systems, it provides limited relief to existing tax-exempt debt. But there is a significant tradeoff for this relief: eliminating publicly-owned utilities' ability to issue tax-exempt debt for facilities that will be used in a competitive marketplace.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in an informal discussion with the Senator from North Dakota, each of us has expressed a hope that we may be able to vote on my amendment shortly after the recess and perhaps after the official photograph of the Senate. I will simply summarize arguments that the Presiding Officer has made so eloquently on each of the amendments on this subject that has been before us and that I made earlier. 
It does seem to me curious that the two opponents of the amendment made dramatically opposite statements in opposing this amendment. The Senator from North Dakota said in spite of the clear language of the amendment, that instead of a ceiling of so many thousands of dollars an hour, depending on when the litigation began that is the thrust of my amendment, that, in fact, it will be considered a floor. 
One can take that position only by not reading the amendment and all the considerations that are included in it, but he was afraid that it would mean in many cases we would be paying too much. 
The Senator from Illinois felt it was terrible to limit lawyers even to $4,000 an hour, because many of them had made agreements under which they would get more. And indeed, as the Presiding Officer said in response to a question from me, we already have one example of one set of attorneys already being awarded well over $2 billion for representing one State, the State of Texas, in litigation of this sort and the attorney general of Texas bitterly opposing the attempt by the Governor of Texas to get a more reasonable set of attorneys' fees. 
We want to end those debates, and the adoption of this amendment will end those debates, because it will provide a ceiling, I think a highly reasonable ceiling. In fact, I had some of my colleagues tell me privately that they don't like my amendment because it is too much. They can't explain even these amounts. In the abstract, that, of course, is the case, but as against $2.3 billion, as against many of the contingent fee agreements, one can explain these limitations and they are just that; they are ceilings and not anything else. 
For those who feel that the sky should be the limit, that no matter how many billions of dollars attorneys have contracted for, no matter how much they have pled with us to pass this legislation, no matter how much minute regulation they are asking us to impose on every aspect of the tobacco industry--the farmers, the manufacturers, the wholesalers, the retailers--more regulation than the Congress of the United States has ever imposed on any other legal business in history, that, nonetheless, one aspect of the contracts between States and other plaintiffs and their lawyers should be entirely free of any concern on our part whatsoever. 
Mr. President, I just can't see how anyone can justify this bill, hundreds of pages of detailed regulations, and say nothing about attorneys' fees other than an arbitration in which the only people represented are the plaintiffs' lawyers and the plaintiffs who have signed the contracts in the first place. No, that is not balance; that is not fair. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, I disagreed with his previous amendment because it seemed to me that there were certain circumstances under which it was too low. I think we ought to do justice to lawyers who have done an extraordinary job, who have in some cases come up with new theories and have been successful with those theories, but I think we have the right to say enough is enough. This amendment, Mr. President, says enough is enough. And in the future, when tobacco litigation will be very, very easy, a much smaller enough is going to be enough. 
Probably the long-term result of this amendment would be not dissimilar in the total amount of attorneys' fees paid from the Faircloth amendment that came so close to adoption late last week. This amendment, however, would see to it the lion's share of those recoveries would go to the attorneys who actually earned them and not those who have gotten in very late. 
I commend this to my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, as being reasonable and as being something that should be a part of any overall pattern that we pass, and that is to put us at the heart of the whole debate over tobacco. If we can regulate everyone else, we can regulate the attorneys. We do it fairly in this amendment, and I trust as soon as we come to an agreement on the time it will be voted on, that it will be adopted and we can go on to other important developments in this bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, this will mark the third occasion on which the Senate has debated a limitation on attorneys' fees in connection with the litigation that led to this debate on tobacco legislation. As a consequence, I do not believe this debate need last for as extended a period of time as did those on the earlier Faircloth amendments, and I believe the leadership is attempting to reach a time agreement on this amendment, with a vote to take place perhaps right after the official Senate photograph early this afternoon. On the other hand, I do not have any official notification about a formal time agreement, but I will proceed on the basis that this Gorton amendment can be debated relatively expeditiously. 
I have examined the debate on the last amendment on attorneys' fees that took place on June 11, less than a week ago, and I believe that the rationale for passing legislation with some limits on attorneys' fees in connection with this litigation was so well stated by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, and by the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and by others that I do not need to repeat in detail their scholarly approach and analyses of the subject. 
Mr. President, you may say, agreeing with their rationale, why is it that this Senator voted against both the first and the second Faircloth amendments? The answer to that is simple. I believe that it is appropriate for the Congress to limit attorneys' fees in connection with this litigation for reasons that I will outline briefly in the course of these comments. At the same time, I did not believe that the particular limitations contained in the two earlier Faircloth amendments were fair or just. So, with some regret but with firmness, I voted to table each of those amendments. 
The fundamental reason for my opposition to those two amendments was the fact that they treated all attorneys in all tobacco cases as being subject to the same cap or the same limitation. Whether that litigation and those attorneys were involved from the very beginning with the States of Mississippi and Minnesota, at a time at which tobacco companies had not lost any litigation at all, when those initial attorneys came up with what were novel and difficult theories of law and took a tremendous risk in the litigation in which they were hired, those attorneys were treated the same in the two earlier amendments as attorneys who have just recently gotten into litigation on this issue after it was obvious that, at the very least, settlements were available to all of the plaintiffs and, for that matter, were treated the same as any attorney who brings litigation in the future when both the States and this bill have so substantially changed the burden of proof in tobacco litigation that one may almost say that an attorney who loses a tobacco case will be exposed to malpractice litigation thereafter. 
Mr. President, that is fundamentally unfair. And so the amendment that I have put before the Senate today, for our vote, treats attorneys' fees differently depending on when the litigation was commenced. I have adopted all of the considerations for judges to use in determining the amount of attorneys' fees that are fair in a given case that were a part of the second Faircloth amendment. They, in turn, are an expanded version of considerations that the Supreme Court of the United States has articulated as used when the question of reasonable attorneys' fees has come before the Supreme Court. 
So the dollar figures that we use per hour in this amendment are ceilings; they are not floors. If, in any case, the courts or others who make judgments in this connection feel that those figures are too high--and I think there will be many instances in which they do--they may be reduced below that ceiling. We simply set a ceiling. 
The ceiling, unlike the $1,000 ceiling in the last Faircloth amendment which was mitigated by allowing a cost recovery greater than the actual cost expenditures, is simply this. For lawyers who are part of litigating cases that began before 1995, the ceiling will be $4,000 an hour--four times that in the Faircloth amendment. For lawyers as a part of litigation that was brought after the beginning of 1995 but before April of 1997, the maximum figure, the ceiling, will be $2,000 an hour. Why, you may ask, April 1997, 2 months before the tobacco settlement was announced? That was the date, the time, that Liggett gave up--in effect, turned state's evidence--turned all of the internal memoranda, which show the horrendous way, the unprincipled way, the tobacco companies had acted, over to the general public, to all of the lawyers. 
So after that date, after a date at which tobacco litigation was not only unprecedented and of extraordinary difficulty but really quite simple and easy, the maximum figure will be the $1,000 an hour--in this case, identical to the overall limit in that Faircloth amendment, but only a recovery of actual costs. 
And, finally, beginning on a date that roughly corresponds with the beginning of this debate on the floor of the Senate, in the anticipation that even the rules of evidence will be lower and lesser if this bill should pass, the ceiling will be $500 an hour--actually lower than the Faircloth amendment itself. 
It seems to this Senator, Mr. President, that that is more nuanced and more fair than the one-size-fits-all proposition that was contained in the two earlier amendments on which we voted. 
As a consequence, this amendment is suggested to all of my colleagues here in the Senate, both those who felt that a lower limit was appropriate but were unsuccessful in getting a majority and those who, like myself, objected to the two earlier Faircloth amendments. 
I believe it is very difficult to stand for the proposition that there should be no limitation under any set of circumstances. That might be an appropriate position for Members of the U.S. Senate if we were not engaged in this debate. If the very people whose clients have come before us asking us to pass that bill--ratify the settlement made by the great majority of States of the United States--had not come here to Congress to ask us to pass this legislation, we would have no business simply debating attorneys' fees in the abstract in this connection. But they are here. They have used up, as 
the Senator from Idaho said, too much of our time already, time which might more profitably have been devoted to other legislation. 
But it has been a serious debate. It has been a debate in which we have examined every single element not only of the litigation that led to this debate but of the whole relationship between tobacco, the tobacco industry, and the farmers, teenagers, adults, health care, and the like. And to say that the only aspect of tobacco policy that we cannot and should not examine is the fees of the attorneys who are involved in this litigation, to me, Mr. President, is an unsupportable proposition.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Mr. Taylor, in stating the case for limitations on lawyers' fees, sets up the five fundamental arguments against doing so and deals with each of those five. 
The first is, `Don't mess with the marketplace'--that these were accounts freely entered into. In the first place, I am not sure that there was a great deal of `marketplace' in connection with litigation much of which was solicited by the lawyers themselves. 
But in any event, the marketplace disappears with this legislation. There is no real marketplace for tobacco products anymore. It will be the most regulated marketplace for any legal commodity in the United States, far exceeding the degree of regulation applied to alcohol and alcoholic beverages, for example. So if we can regulate the marketplace for tobacco, we can regulate the marketplace for tobacco lawyers. 
The second objection that is brought up is that these are sacrosanct contract rights. But, of course, these are contract rights that are subject to review by the courts, by the judges who are dealing with this litigation. There have already been judgments made in that connection. The law is clear that attorneys' fees must be reasonable. And when they are unreasonable or overreaching, the courts, with their equity powers, said, `We can intervene.' Well, then, Mr. President, it seems to me that we can intervene as well. We represent the conscience of the people of the United States. And I believe overwhelmingly the people of the United States will reject the kind of attorneys' fees running up into the billions of dollars that seem clearly possible and perhaps close to certainty should we not intervene in this aspect of the marketplace. 
The third objection is States rights--that all of this litigation was brought by the States; we ought to stay out of it. Again, Mr. President, a good argument had the States not come to us and asked us to pass this legislation, because literally, in the case of most of them, they could not reach the goals they sought without the assistance of the President and the Congress of the United States. 
The fourth reason--and it has been expressed on this floor--is that these lawyers deserve these big, huge fees. I was presiding, Mr. President, when Senator Hollings eloquently made that case, that whatever they get they earn. Well, I suppose one can make that argument, but I do not believe that most of the American people believe that lawyers, under any circumstances, should earn $10,000 or $50,000 or $92,000 or $200,000 an hour for their work, no matter how imaginative and how successful that work may be. 
I think there are very few Members of this body who believe firmly that they deserve fees larger than the $4,000 cap that is included in this amendment. 
The final argument that Mr. Taylor set out in his essay 2 or 3 weeks ago was that $250 an hour was not enough. That, of course, was a reference to the first Faircloth amendment, and I agreed with Mr. Taylor, $250 was not enough for those who had begun this litigation by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think, myself, $1,000 was enough. 
That is why, with a bit more reluctance, I voted against the second Faircloth amendment. But I certainly believe that the staged amount that we have in this amendment is enough and is enough for each of the four different categories of lawyers to whom it applies. It is for that reason that I have placed this proposal before the Senate once more in a different fashion than the fashion in which it previously appeared. 
This is a legitimate part of the debate over tobacco legislation. We should reflect the conscience of the American people in this connection. We should try to see to it the maximum amount of money, consistent with fairness, that changes hands in one respect or another as a result of this legislation goes to the social and mostly antismoking purposes for which it is intended. We don't need to make billionaires out of lawyers simply because they were lucky enough or even wise enough to get into this field at an opportune time. We particularly don't need to do that for those lawyers who didn't either bother or have enough imagination to get into it until this kind of litigation was a slam dunk. 
This is perhaps one element of our system of justice that increasingly disturbs the American people. We have dealt with it a little bit at a time in tort reform legislation. I hope that the Senate will take up a product liability bill and I hope now we can get a bipartisan degree of support here on the Senate floor and get a signature from the President on a modest attempt to reform our legal system. 
I voted for all such reforms that have come before the Senate while I have been here in the last 7 years. I am not generally considered to be someone who defends trial lawyers. I found it a little bit awkward to vote against the first two Faircloth amendments, but I think even with respect to people with whom I disagree, with whom many of us disagree, fairness is vitally important. I have designed this amendment in a way to be fair and to be equitable, to treat people in different circumstances differently. I submit it to the consideration of the Senate on that basis.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota finds himself on the horns of a delicious dilemma. He feels there may be cases in which the amendment I propose would result in attorneys' fees being awarded that are too great, and so his answer is to reject the amendment and allow attorneys' fees in any amount. Attorneys' fees in one case, in Texas, I believe, have already been approved by the court in an amount more than 10 times higher than the highest amount in this amendment. I am afraid the Senator from North Dakota misreads the amendment. 
The heart and soul of the amendment is a set of criteria for determining reasonable attorneys' fees, listing a wide range of factors, some of which we have discussed here, but leaving the matter to the discretion of the court. There is a limitation imposed on the discretion of the court by the amendment in the amounts that we have stated and debated. This is a cap and by no means a floor. 
The Senator from North Dakota says that the better system is the system that is included in this bill, a system of arbitration. But, and the current Presiding Officer has read this very carefully, this is some kind of arbitration. This arbitration is to be decided under the bill by three arbitrators --one appointed by the plaintiff's trial lawyer himself, one appointed by the plaintiff, and a third appointed by the first two. The plaintiff has already signed an agreement--the plaintiff in most of these major cases is the State--they have signed an agreement, in some cases, for a 25-percent contingency fee on billions of dollars' worth of recoveries. Who is going to represent the public interest in this arbitration? No, Mr. President, there isn't anyone there to do that.

Mr. GORTON. I am reading section 1413. It says: 
. . .In any such arbitration, the arbitration panel shall consist of 3 persons, one of whom shall be chosen by the plaintiff, one of whom shall be chosen by the attorney, and one of whom shall be chosen jointly by those 2 arbitrators. 
That is not plaintiff and defendant. That is a fixed deal. In any event, to say that because it is possible that this sets a ceiling, that a $4,000 fee or a $2,000 fee might be too great a ceiling, we should, therefore, have no ceiling at all, we should, therefore, allow attorneys' fees that have already been approved in far larger amounts, is, I think, a difficult argument to make. 
The Senator from North Dakota makes it very well. But, in fact, the Congress of the United States has set attorneys' fees in all kinds of cases. They were discussed a few days ago by the Senator from Alabama and by others. There are many forms of litigation against the government itself in which we have set attorneys' fees that now, I think, are rather modest with the passage of time. 
This is not unprecedented by any stretch of the imagination. What is unprecedented is the generosity of the proposal that I have put before the Senate. It is not unprecedented from the point of view of whether or not we have done it. No, we either have to say that because the States of these attorneys have come to us and have asked us to regulate tobacco in every conceivable, possible fashion, because they have asked us for a bill--this bill that makes it almost 
impossible for them to lose a case in the future because it totally changes the burden of proof--that we can say there is a certain level beyond which the conscience just simply doesn't allow attorneys' fees to go, or you have to take the position that we can regulate everything with respect to tobacco to the minutest degree, but we dare not touch attorneys' fees, personally, I think that is a very, very difficult argument to make. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there is at least an informal understanding that there will be a debate on this amendment tomorrow for approximately 1 hour. With the kind indulgence of my friend and colleague from Minnesota, I am going to simply give a brief explanation of this amendment now so Members who are watching, or staffs who are watching, will understand its general subject matter. 
Twice during the course of this debate we have debated the subject of limitations on attorneys' fees. On both occasions I have voted to table those amendments, not because I felt that limitations on attorneys' fees in connection with tobacco litigation and legislation were not appropriate, but because I felt that the amendments themselves were unfair. This amendment is a third attempt to provide some limitations in a manner that I, at least, believe to be considerably more sensitive and more fair to the attorneys who have been involved in that litigation. I hope under those circumstances it will be given reasonably careful consideration by my colleagues. 
We are dealing with litigation that is literally unprecedented, I think, in the history of the United States, with the potential of immense recoveries on the part of various States interfered with and amended by the legislation that we are considering here on the floor. Under those circumstances, the possibility that attorneys' fees would be awarded in the billions of dollars--perhaps even in the billions of dollars to some individual firms, but certainly in the order of nine digits to many individuals and individual firms--is a matter that I think greatly disturbs the majority of the American people and many, if not most, members of the bar. Those attorneys' fees have been subject to much criticism from the outside, and there should be a way to see to it that they are dealt with fairly. 
The difficulty with the two earlier amendments, in my view at least, was that they treated all lawyers, all attorneys who were involved in tobacco litigation--past, present, and future--in exactly the same fashion. Yet it is obvious that, if we look at the history of this controversy, the initial litigation and the ideas for that initial litigation that were brought forth some time ago, in the early 1990s, were developed by a group of tremendously gifted and imaginative attorneys at a time at which the odds on their success, looking at it from the beginning, would have been judged to have been very small. 
They have shown great skill, great persistence; they have spent, in many cases, a great deal of their own and their law firms' money; and I think the reward they have earned is considerably larger than awards that will be earned by those who got into this litigation very late in the game when it was obvious that the litigation was going to be settled for large amounts of money or litigated successfully; not to mention those who will bring tobacco-related litigation in the future when, under the terms of this bill, and many State legislative acts, it will be almost impossible for an attorney to lose a tobacco case. 
As a consequence, the fundamental approach of this amendment is to say that for those who were in this litigation early--that is, before the end of the year 1994--attorneys' fees can be up to $4,000 an hour--a huge amount of money beyond any question, a mind-boggling amount of money, but nevertheless considerably less than many of these attorneys will get in the absence of such legislation, on the basis of percentage contingent fees. 
Moreover, like other amendments in this connection, that is a ceiling, not a floor. The courts, in this case, will make a determination considering all of the same items that have been outlined in previous decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and in previous amendments on this subject. So when a judge determines that amount is too much, the judge may reduce the amount below that hourly fee but under no circumstances may go above it. 
The second category of attorneys will be those who were involved in this litigation after 1994 but before early last year. Their ceiling will be half the amount of the pioneers, or $2,000 an hour. And certain other attorneys who worked on developing the ideas that went into this case will fall into that category as well. 
The next clear date is when the Liggett Tobacco Company agreed, in effect, to turn state's evidence to settle the matter and to admit its liabilities and admit, generally speaking, the liabilities of the other tobacco companies. Those who got into the litigation after that were almost certain winners--almost certain winners. They did not run the risks that earlier attorneys did, and their maximum fee under this amendment will be $1,000 an hour. That will, in fact, be somewhat less than the maximum recovery under the last Faircloth amendment, because while it stated the sum of $1,000 an hour, it allowed for recovery of costs over--considerably over and above the actual costs incurred in the litigation. 
Finally, after the beginning of this debate here, assuming that this debate, of course, ends up in actual legislation, tobacco litigation will be almost like Workmen's Compensation litigation in all of our State courts, and the limit there is $500 an hour under this amendment, half that in the last Faircloth proposal. Again, these are limits, these are maximums, but they are maximums set in a different way than they were in the other two amendments, reflecting the actual risks, the actual imagination, the actual work that went into the litigation and, for that matter, into the legislation itself. 
I am not certain this is a totally perfect proposal of this nature, but I think it is highly reasonable. I think it is highly generous. I think it meets the views of people in the United States as a whole who do not think the lawyers in this case should become billionaires out of it. And it will husband the actual recoveries, whatever those recoveries may be and however they are derived, far more for the purposes of the litigation and the legislation itself than relatively unlimited contingent fees would do. 
That is a brief explanation and a justification of something that I hope meets with the support of those who have felt that there ought to be limits on those attorneys' fees, but that they should be somewhat lower and those on the other side, who, like I, have voted against these previous limitations on the grounds that they weren't sensitive enough and for at least some people were not high enough. I would like to bring people together on this so that at least this particular element of this debate can be brought to a successful conclusion.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the absence of any other person here, I yield myself that time to say that during 2 years when I was not in the Senate, between 1987 and 1989, I had the privilege of being a partner in a Seattle firm, Davis, Wright and Tremaine, the senior partner of which, Cameron DeVore, is one of the most distinguished first amendment lawyers in the United States. He informed me in no uncertain terms, and I agree with him, that this proposal is clearly and blatantly unconstitutional. You cannot condition a right, a privilege, available to everyone else in the United States, on its abandonment of its first amendment rights--a highly simple proposition. 
We can and we should limit advertising of cigarettes. We can only do that constitutionally, Mr. President, if we come up with a bill like the proposal made by the State attorneys general that has the agreement of those who are asked to give up their first amendment rights to advertising. Therefore, this amendment should be defeated. 
On another matter, Mr. President, on Thursday, for the second time, I voted against limitations on attorney's fees in these cases, because in both cases I thought they were unfair. I will soon introduce an amendment that allows higher attorney's fees for those who began these cases early, when they were greatly at risk and ask for lower attorney's fees for those attorneys who got in late, when winning cases of the nature that have been discussed here is like shooting fish in a barrel. 
I think we should be fair. I think we also have the right to propose and propound such limitations to those who have come before the Congress asking us to intervene in what previously was litigation outside of the scope of the Congress at all. 
I am sorry I have no more time at this point to discuss that proposal, but it is both nuanced in favor of those attorneys who really did the yeomen's work in this connection 
and much less favorable to those who got in essentially after the fact and who will be engaged in such litigation in the future. 
Mr. President, I move to table the Reed amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. GORTON. This is the last day that the Spring page class will be with us. And I am going to take a moment to recognize and thank this fine group of young people for their invaluable assistance in the Senate. Their hard work keeps the Senate running smoothly on a day-to-day basis. All of our pages are accomplished students and involved in their schools and communities. However, I would like to specifically commend the page from my home State of Washington, Sina Nazemi, for his outstanding efforts. Even among this class of exceptional young people Sina has set himself apart. 
Over the last 6 months I have had the opportunity to get to know Sina and while I recognized that he was a fine student and a personable young man, I have also learned that Sina is rather secretive. After six months of working in the Senate, today I learned that his peers chose Sina to serve as President of the page class. Today, the faculty and principal at the page school also recognized Sina with the Leadership Award and the Good Citizen Award. What initially prompted my recognition of Sina was his winning essay in the 1998 Law Day Essay Competition sponsored by the District of Columbia Courts and The Bar Association of the District of Columbia, which I only learned of last week. 
Sina's essay is a well written piece on the importance of the first amendment that draws heavily on his first hand experience as an immigrant from Iran. He writes that the first amendment creates `a battlefield of ideas which allows the best ideas to emerge'. I hope he was at least in part inspired by the `battlefield of ideas' that is evident each day on the Senate floor. 
In addition to serving as class president, Sina kept pace with the rigorous academics at the Page School and the work schedule of the Senate. We keep these kids working so hard that Sina didn't even have the whole week of Easter recess off. I held an education forum in the state that week, and Sina served admirably as the moderator and spokesperson for the student group. All of this is done with diligence and enthusiasm. Sina has a great deal to be proud of yet, the modesty he shows reflect maturity beyond his years. These attributes will undoubtedly serve him well in his future. Sina, you have my best wishes and thanks for your service to the Senate. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, although I am speaking on the same side of this proposition as did the Senator from Massachusetts, I believe it is appropriate for us to deal with this issue. Parties whose fee agreements we are interfering with have come to the Congress of the United States to ratify settlements that have already been made. If we can vote here on how much money States will receive and how they have to spend that money, if we can change the law to shift the burdens in tobacco litigation, we can address the issue of attorney's fees. 
I also agree with the amendment's sponsors that we can and should set the attorneys' maximum compensation. I do not agree, however, that the amount proposed in this amendment is reasonable. It is too much for lawyers who bring lawsuits in the future, when, under this bill, it will be much easier to prevail against tobacco manufacturers. At the same time, the amount is considerably too little for those highly skilled attorneys who took on the tobacco companies on novel theories years ago, when their chances of winning were extremely remote. 
If we are going to set maximum attorneys' fees, we ought to set them on a reasonable basis, a basis that fully accounts for the relative amounts of risk, skill, and investment on the lawyers' part. Unfortunately, this amendment does not do this. It does not make distinctions that I believe are fair and proper. For this reason, the amendment is not a good one, and I believe that it should be tabled.

Mr. GORTON. Last week, Mr. President, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright traveled to Geneva to meet with the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The purpose of her meeting was to convince the world's declared nuclear powers to join the United States in condemning India and Pakistan for their recent nuclear tests and somehow to prevent an arms race from escalating in South Asia. To no one's surprise but her own and President Clinton's, no agreement was reached. 
The foreign policy of the United States in the Clinton Administration has now come down to this. In dealing with the People's Republic of China, a country with a developing internal free market, but repressive of any political dissent, with systematic restrictions against competitive American products, and a blind eye toward billions of dollars of intellectual property piracy, we not only don't defend the victims of these practices, we generously supply the PRC with missile technology that allows it to increase in its already immense threat to its neighbors. 
The Clinton Administration gives `Most Favored Nation' treatment for China a whole new meaning. What it means now is, what China wants, China gets--even an American president to be greeted on Tiananmen Square, insulting the memory of its martyrs. 
And then we are surprised when India tests nuclear weapons, joining a club we founded fifty years ago. We react by sanctioning--unilaterally--the world's most populous democracy. And we follow up by imposing the same sanctions on Pakistan, a long time ally, for a natural and justified reaction to India's tests. 
As Charles Krauthammer so eloquently put it in his column in Friday's Washington Post, the President: . . . is guilty of more than mere fatuousness, however, in dealing with the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race,. He is guilty of fueling it. While for years his administration has claimed deep concern about proliferation, [he] has shamelessly courted the world's worst proliferator of weapons of mass destruction: China. 
Not only is the administration in large part to blame for the current crisis, but is now taking steps to ensure that our economy will suffer together with our national security. The President has decided to impose harsh economic sanctions on both India and Pakistan. 
It has already been made alarmingly clear that unilateral sanctions do not work. For the law the President stands behind in his decision to impose sanctions was designed not to punish other nations for flexing their nuclear muscle, but to deter them from entering the nuclear club. As David E. Sanger wrote in The New York Times on May 24, `passionate national causes--particularly the urge for self-sufficiency--almost always trump economic rationality.' Mr. Sanger goes on to say, wisely, that `unilateral sanctions almost never work--precisely because they are unilateral. In a global economy, there are too many producers of almost everything.' 
The President has told the American people that he has no choice but to impose the sanctions, claiming that they are required under the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. What he doesn't say is that Sections 102 (b)(4) and (5) of that law provide the President authority to waive the sanctions in whole or in part if he uses the 30 day delay allowed him before imposing the sanctions. The President did not use the 30 day delay. The reason for his rush to impose sanctions is clear. The President has no other solution. 
But unilateral sanctions do little to produce results. Instead, they harm U.S. workers, farmers, and families. My home state of Washington has a lot at stake in this international dispute. In 1996, Washington exports to India totaled $429.39 million and India was the state's fourteenth largest export market. Boeing airplane sales to India totaled $372.8 million in 1996 and accounted for a large majority of overall Washington state exports to that country. Most of the planes India purchases from Boeing are financed by the Export-Import Bank. If the President cuts off Ex-Im Bank loans to India, Boeing, and Washington state's economy will feel a major strain. 
Washington is the largest producer of soft white wheat, Pakistan's grain of choice. Pakistan is the largest market for Washington state wheat exports. 
During Fiscal Year 1997, Pakistan purchased 2 million metric tons of soft white wheat from the Pacific Northwest--32 percent of total soft white wheat exports from the region. So far in FY 1998, Pakistan has purchased 2.14 million metric tons of soft white wheat--37 percent of total wheat exports from the region, with purchases from Washington totaling $140 million. 
While American farmers and manufacturers stand today at risk of losing these important markets, their counterparts in Canada, Europe, and Australia are celebrating the shortsightedness of the U.S. Administration. For the U.S. sanctions are better for their businesses than the most ingenious of marketing campaigns. They are happy to step in and fill the place of American exporters in India and Pakistan. 
Mr. President, if the U.S. is the only country imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan for actions strongly supported by a large majority of their people, then the Indian and Pakistani governments and the Indian and Pakistani people will turn to nations that are not criticizing their actions for their imports. Airbus and Canadian or Australian grain farmers will benefit from U.S. actions, while Boeing and U.S. farmers will be left out in the cold. 
The President must take action now to resolve the situation in South Asia and end the sanctions. If he does not, the American people will suffer the consequences of his mistakes for a long time. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1984, I spoke in this Chamber to champion passage of a bill that would dramatically expand the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area. The bill became law, and the wilderness area now boasts more than 390,000 acres of alpine and subalpine forests, 450 miles of trails, more than 500 lakes and countless peaks and pinnacles. It offers year-round opportunities for hikers, campers, skiers, fishermen, or those who simply want time away from urban life. It is arguably one of Washington's favorite recreational sites. 
Today, I introduce legislation that would dramatically enhance the value of this recreational and environmental jewel--a bill to complete the I-90 Land Exchange between the Forest Service and Plum Creek Timber Company. The land exchange would bring up to 60,000 acres of forest land adjacent to the wilderness area into public ownership, creating a stretch of publicly owned forest from the southern border of the wilderness area to I-90. 
Plum Creek would trade up to 60,000 acres of its land on the I-90 corridor of the Central Cascades for up to 40,000 acres of Forest Service land in three different forests. The benefits of the exchange are immense. It will place into public hands some of the last large blocks of privately owned old growth forest and increase publicly owned spotted owl habitat by 22,000 acres. It will bring into public ownership 14 miles of Pacific Crest Trail. It would eliminate much of the complicated checkerboard land ownership pattern, under which public and private entities each owns every other square mile of land. And it will fulfill a long-sought priority of Washington's environmental community--the public acquisition of prized sites such as Silver Creek, Scatter Creek, and Thorp Mountain. 
There is a long history of controversy surrounding these lands. Although the land exchange has been under consideration in one form or another for more than a decade, this is the closest it has ever come to completion. 
Conservationists began pushing for a resolution to the checkerboard ownership pattern back in the late 1970's. In 1986, the Forest Service and Plum Creek considered an exchange in the Silver Creek basin, the heart of the land exchange package under consideration today. 
In 1988, with the support of local environmental groups and Plum Creek, a legislative proposal to complete the exchange was brought to Congress. When the bill was not considered, the Forest Service and Plum Creek launched an attempt to complete the exchange administratively. However, the listing of the spotted owl put the project on hold. 
Since that time, some parcels have been acquired using the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but with such limited federal resources and such a vast amount of land, an exchange has proven to be the only way to bring a final resolution to the Central Cascades' checkerboard. 
In fact, the Conference Report that accompanied the 1996 fiscal year appropriation for the Forest Service stated: 
The managers continue to encourage strongly the use of land exchanges as a way in which to protect important recreational or environmentally significant lands, in lieu of the Federal Government acquiring lands. The managers believe that land exchanges represent a more cost-effective way in which to do business and encourage the Forest Service to give high priority to those exchanges either nearing completion, or where land management decisions are made particularly difficult due to checkerboard ownership. 
In August of 1995, Plum Creek and the Forest Service went back to the drawing board, and agreed to initiate the I-90 exchange. By mid-June of 1996, when Plum Creek signed a 420,000 acre Habitat Conservation Plan, Plum Creek and Secretary Glickman entered into a two year agreement to finish the exchange. Plum Creek agreed to withhold harvest on most of the exchangeable lands worth approximately $200 million during the two-year period, and although that deadline has now passed, Plum Creek agreed to extend it through the end of this year. 
But we're still running out of time. If we fail, we will lose this opportunity to maximize the public benefits of this exchange. Neither Plum Creek nor the Forest Service has the financial resources to continue endlessly this process. No one can reasonably expect Plum Creek to have the patience to continue on with this arduous and difficult process indefinitely. 
If the I-90 Land Exchange is not completed by year's end, the exchange will begin to fall apart under the weight of an endless appeals process and litigation battles that could go well into the next century. And it's not reasonable to expect Plum Creek to sustain operations on the exchangeable lands through the indefinite and uncertain appeals process. 
To put it bluntly, if the exchange is appealed, this current opportunity will be lost forever and we won't have another chance to acquire such a large block of some of Washington's premier forest land. 
That's why I am introducing this bill. We need to keep all options open for finishing the land exchange on time. I understand that both Plum Creek and the Forest Service are still committed to the administrative process, and that's important. With the introduction of this bill and companion legislation in the House by Congressman Doc Hastings, we now have two options for finishing this land exchange on time and getting the most value out of the trade. 
Ultimately, public support or public opposition will determine the outcome of the exchange, regardless of how it is completed. Passing a bill though Congress and earning the President's signature demands public support. 
The building blocks are in place. In March, Washington State Governor Gary Locke wrote to President Clinton urging completion of the exchange by the end of the year. The State Legislature unanimously passed a resolution in support of the exchange. Recreational enthusiasts see the long-term value of bringing these lands into public ownership. Environmentalists recognize the value of blocking up these lands to create a habitat corridor for wildlife and to protect some of the last large blocks of privately owned old growth forest. And major newspapers have endorsed it. 
Earlier this spring, the Seattle P-I described the dire consequences if this land swap was not completed this year. The PI-'s editorial stated: `None of the land exchanges is apt to satisfy everyone involved. But if the lands are not consolidated, however imperfectly, it will be next to impossible to preserve them effectively for salmon or wildlife habitat. And that's a real lose-lose.' 
Under the administrative process, however, it only takes one voice of opposition to file an appeal and kill the proposal for good. 
The lands package outlined in this bill is not final as discussions and negotiations continue back in Washington state. I appreciate that all parties are at the table working towards a lands package that everyone can support, and I know from experience that these discussions take time and patience. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize once more that the legislation I am introducing today is only a placeholder. It represents a starting point--albeit an excellent one--to achieve a consensus-based end product. I encourage the parties now at the table to continue their efforts and to expedite the completion of this large and vital exchange.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today in recognition of the 100th Anniversary of the Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Company. On June 12, 1998, Mutual of Enumclaw will celebrate its 100th Anniversary and a century of successful service in the insurance industry. The company originated in 1898 as the Farmers Mutual Insurance Company at a time when the town of Enumclaw, Washington found its economic base primarily in the railroad, dairy, and lumber industries. The company was established to `insure farm and village buildings and personal property against loss by fire and lightening.' 
This goal remained the focus of the company until 1945, when it expanded to insure non-farm property. Five years later it expanded its area of service to include Oregon and Idaho. In 1963, the company began writing commercial property and casualty insurance and three years later officially changed its name to Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Company. The company sustained admirable growth throughout the following decades, as reflected by the A+ rating it has consistently received from the A.M. Best Company, a publisher of insurance information and company ratings. 
Mutual of Enumclaw employs approximately 500 people and helps to provide a sound economic base for the Enumclaw community. As Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Company celebrates its first hundred years, it looks to the future and to the challenge of continuing to learn and grow in order to meet the evolving needs of its customers.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now asked to vote on a bill authorizing the expenditure of more than $200 billion. No member of the Senate other than a handful of conferees has seen a copy of the bill; no one knows anything about its major policy implication. 
The Senate bill allowed each state's money to be spent as each state determined. This bill included hundreds of Congressionally designated projects in both the highway and mass transit accounts. Although the earmarked Washington state projects were all appropriate in the highway category, the mass transit title did not treat my state fairly. The Regional Transit Authority, perhaps the most cost-effective project in the nation, was less fairly treated than projects abandoned by the communities for which they are authorized. 
Even more importantly, the general highway fund distribution formula discriminates unfairly against Washington state. It returns to us a lower percentage of our motor vehicle fuel taxes than does present law, the original Senate bill, or the House bill. Our conferees in the Senate did not represent us well. 
The bill is full of pork and unfair. I will vote against it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, perhaps a brief review of history as to how and why we find ourselves in the position we are in in this debate is an appropriate point at which to begin. 
Over the years, the Congress has delicately paced around the outer edges of the controversy over tobacco, encouraging certain voluntary limitations on advertising, particularly by television, requiring certain warnings to be included on packages of cigarettes and on advertising, but never getting to the heart of the issue of the desirability or the lack of a desirability of tobacco. 
Those limitations can be looked at as either a glass partly full or one largely empty. It is clear the major tobacco companies have attempted to remain profitable by creating, through advertising and peer pressure and in any other method that they could, a constantly increasing supply of new smokers, 
almost all of whom have begun smoking with the conscious knowledge of its adverse impact on their life expectancy and on their health, although when they began young this was not something that was at the forefront of the thoughts of youth. 
Nevertheless, in the United States of America, over the course of the last 20 or 30 years, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of men and women who smoke. We, as Americans, probably smoke less than almost any other country in the world. 
Various individuals and groups have sued tobacco companies as a result of the adverse impacts of smoking on health. Almost without exception, those individuals have lost those in connection with that litigation. 
All of this had us in a situation that was almost stable until a group of State attorneys general and private lawyers came along with a new theory, that damage was caused not just to individual smokers but to the treasuries of our States and, by extension, to our own Treasury, through Medicaid primarily, through Medicare, and through the expenses of taking care of tobacco-related health problems, that these damages totaled in the billions of dollars. And, as a consequence, most of the States of the United States brought actions against tobacco companies to recover those losses to their States. 
Some, as you know, Mr. President, acting independently, have already won that litigation by settlement or otherwise. The bulk of them, almost a year ago, reached an agreement with the tobacco companies for what is almost certainly the most massive judgment or change in practices that has ever taken place in this country--close to $400 billion in payments, dramatic and voluntary restrictions not only on advertising but on various other forms of promotion, a set of goals for lessened teen smoking, and a myriad of other ideas. 
A part of that settlement is involved in the amendment before us right now, because that settlement purported to protect the tobacco companies against some forms of litigation, although not all forms of litigation. Those protections have been abandoned or rejected by this bill in return for certain other, less significant limitations on the annual liability of tobacco companies to individual litigation. 
But, Mr. President, the centerpiece of the agreement with the State attorneys general, without whose work we clearly would not be debating this issue here today any more than we have for the last 10 or 20 years, the centerpiece of that agreement was its voluntary nature. As the eloquent Senator from Massachusetts, who is managing this bill on the other side of the aisle, pointed out, advertising restrictions, upfront payments, document collections, and probably the look-back provisions, are all provisions of that agreement that cannot constitutionally be imposed on the tobacco companies by law. 
As a consequence, we are faced with a delicious challenge. We can make all the heroic antitobacco statements and speeches that we wish, we can pile on to a greater extent than even the most radical bills that have been introduced into this body, but we cannot force tobacco companies, as long as they are engaged in a legal business--so far, we do not have a bill that would absolutely prohibit the use of tobacco--we can pass whatever legislation we wish, but we cannot force them to abandon their first amendment rights; we cannot violate the Constitution of the United States. 
So in the ultimate analysis, we are either going to pass a 
bill that, however reluctantly, with however much grumbling, the basic tobacco-product manufacturers will accept and follow, or we are simply going to create another bonanza for lawyers in challenging some of the basic provisions of this legislation, in challenges that, by and large, are almost certain to be successful. We may have voted `antitobacco,' but we will not have succeeded in a truly antitobacco result. 
At this point, the tobacco companies have rejected the acceptance of the so-called McCain bill. Perhaps more narrowly, they have rejected the McCain bill as it was reported from the Commerce Committee. Many of the changes that have been made in the bill that is before us are designed, it might well be, as a result of gaining their acquiescence. This amendment, if it is passed, will clearly and necessarily result in their rejection of the entire package. 
Personally, Mr. President, I believe what we ought to do is in effect to ratify, with some toughening, the agreement that the attorneys general of the various States made after long and careful negotiation and litigation. And we will have the opportunity to do that, or come as close as we can to doing that, when we deal with the amendment that will be proposed by my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch. 
But this bill, the McCain bill in its present form, is, in my opinion, a responsible approach toward this problem. I believe that we must deal with the agricultural elements of it, the payments to tobacco farmers, payments that I think are infinitely too high, with the total preservation of the present tobacco program that is included in the Ford provisions, but we will be dealing with that next. 
I believe a significant portion of the money that the Federal Treasury is going to get from this ought to go to tax relief for the American people rather than into other Government-run programs. 
But these are elements of this bill that we will debate at some point in the future. They are not elements that will result in the rejection of the bill by those at whom it is aimed on the grounds of the Constitution. This amendment is. Personally, as I say, I would prefer the provisions on litigation that are contained in the attorneys general bill. It may be that at some point or other we will move back in that direction. 
I am convinced, however, that the amendment that is before us now will destroy any chance of our passing successful antitobacco legislation. Legislation that balances the constitutional rights of those organizations with which we disagree must significantly increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes but not beyond the point where we create a huge black market of contraband cigarettes, 
a point that I believe would have been passed, exceeded, by the Kennedy amendment yesterday, and a package that can result in something ultimately acceptable to the American people, to the courts, to those who manufacture cigarettes, with the net result that we will reduce, though we will never eliminate, cigarette smoking. 
I believe that the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, who did not seek but was given this assignment, has carried it on in a highly credible fashion with a far greater degree of success than I would have predicted when he started. I think he deserves the thanks, the gratitude of all Members of this body, and to a large extent, at least, our support. I am convinced that he deserves our support on this amendment because this amendment will destroy any chance of being truly successful in getting antitobacco legislation through the Congress, and through the President's signature, in a way that will meet the goals that all of us share.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I approve the Faircloth amendment that seeks to limit attorneys fees in tobacco cases to $250 an hour. In addition to being impracticable--it makes the United States Congress bookkeepers charged with tabulating every lawyer hour in tobacco cases--the amendment simply is unfair. While $250 per hour may be just compensation in some cases, I do not agree that this arbitrary cap is appropriate in all instances. 
Attorneys who took tremendous risks and initiated cases on novel theories deserve, I believe, to be compensated for more than those who filed the just-add-water complaints. Even late-coming attorneys in these ground-breaking cases deserve to be paid at least as much as the tobacco company lawyers. This amendment would not allow this, however, because, while the plaintiff lawyers who have not yet been paid would be subject to the cap, many tobacco company lawyers have already been paid an hourly rate that is significantly higher than $250 per hour. 
While I strongly disagree with this one-size-fits-all approach, I share Senator Faircloth's concern with excessive attorneys fees. I suggest, however, that there are other methods and other limits that are far less burdensome on Congress, and will provide a more equitable outcome. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this debate on the bill of the Senator from Arizona and his opponents, or those who would significantly change it and limit it, is a debate between optimists and pessimists about the American condition. Senator Abraham's proposal stems from the proposition that we are in a society so dynamic, changing so rapidly, with so many new technologies on each and every day, that we can do nothing but benefit by recruiting into that economy the most highly skilled people from dozens of nations around the world who seek to make their contribution to humanity as a part of the United States of America as against the nations from which they come, hobbled by societal and governmental restrictions. A large number of the men and women on whom this battle is being waged have been educated here in the United States and have already begun to become a part of our culture. It is the theory of this bill, a theory borne out by the experience of H-1B so far, that not only are these men and women who seek to become Americans contributing to their own well-being and to the progress of our society but are, in fact, creating jobs for others. 
The opponents of this bill, those who would restrict it, those who would tie it by all kinds of restrictions so as to make it impracticable for most of the high-tech companies of the United States to use, still believe implicitly in a zero sum economy--that any job, no matter how skilled, taken by someone who was born somewhere else will inevitably result in a job being deprived from some person born in the United States of America. 
They do this despite the fact that at the hearing on this bill, as I understand it, the Department of Labor could come up with only one example of a true displacement and a guess that there might be two or three others somewhere across the United States. 
So, Mr. President, if you believe that we are not really competitive, that we can't grow, that every job that one person takes of a skilled nature simply comes at the expense of another job already there, then of course you can support the amendments proposed by the Senator from Massachusetts and by the administration, and wreck a system that has already been so successful that we need to expand it in order to meet the expanding needs of a dynamic and growing American society and American economy. 
I find it particularly curious that these attempts to say that every recruiting company must follow rules set out by the Government in recruiting and in retention, detailed rules with major penalties for noncompliance, have made no such proposal with respect to the great bulk of American immigration. 
We get tens, hundreds of thousands of immigrants every year who come to the United States under the guise of family reunification, as seekers of political asylum, as refugees, the great bulk of which have few, if any, skills and over whom there has been a major debate lasting over the last 3 years as to their eligibility for various forms of welfare and who, when they get jobs in order to get off welfare, will be taking the lowest skilled jobs that the United States has to offer where there may well be a real displacement. Yet, these requirements, the requirements of the amendments we are about to deal with, do not deal with these immigrants coming in far larger numbers than the extra 30,000 skilled employees about whom we are speaking at the present time. 
Mr. President, the proposal of the Senator from Michigan is a proposal for a dynamic future for the United States. It is a proposal that will not only create opportunities for men and women, many of whom are educated in the United States, and others of whom are exceptional people for themselves, but for the new jobs and the new opportunities they will create. 
Let me just take one or two examples of a specific company and the way in which it would be impacted by the proposed amendments. My friends at Microsoft tell me they will have hired an individual for a 12-month contract to do a very specific task, say, to develop an Internet site for stamp and coin collectors but then determined that there wasn't enough to warrant going on with the project and dismissed the employee. The proposed amendments backed by the administration would prevent Microsoft from hiring any new H-1B worker for any project for a period of at least 3 to 9 months, or if someone is dismissed because they have worked on a project and are experts at something which is now an anachronism, you cannot hire a new one through H-1B for something that looks to the future and is totally and completely different without meeting all of these restrictions. 
Today we have an example of the Clinton administration's desire to have lawyers and judges design computers. In the amendments this afternoon, quite consistent with that philosophy, we have its desire to act as an employment agency for all of the high-tech companies in America, to tell them who they can hire, when they can hire them, when they can fire them, and what the restrictions on them will be. 
That is not the way we caused our economy in the course of the last 10 years to be one about which we have many questions, many jealousies of the Japanese and of others to the point at which we clearly dominate the world in the very fields in which this bill by the Senator from Michigan is designed to keep us preeminent. 
I congratulate the Senator from Michigan for his dogged determination to see to it that we get to this vote and to say that we should deal with it with no amendments other than those of which he approves.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this Senator simply wishes to report that the Kennedy amendments place the Department of Labor in the shoes of most of these employers with respect to the criteria with which they will engage in employment. We have sent the amendments that the Senator from Massachusetts proposes to the companies that will be affected by them and asked them, the people who are engaged in these hiring activities, what the impact will be. They report to us exactly what I have told the Senate here today. They report, in fact, that the Kennedy amendments are so disastrous for their recruiting they will be worse off with 95,000 H-1Bs and the Kennedy amendments than they would be to retain present law. 
I, for one, am willing to accept the views of the employers in the high-tech community on the impact of these amendments as being exactly what they feel would apply to them. They do not want the Department of Labor making more of their employment decisions than they are making today.

Mr. GORTON. Perhaps, Madam President, I owe the Senator from Massachusetts an apology. Perhaps it is true that he knows better than these high-tech companies whom they ought to hire and when they ought to hire them. Perhaps his effectively granting to the Department of Labor the determination of when a layoff is a layoff and when it is not, when a replacement is an appropriate replacement and when it is not, will be dealt with entirely benignly and will not harm any of our international competitiveness. 
But, Madam President, I think not. I believe that these companies are better judges of their own needs than is the Senator from Massachusetts or the Department of Labor. And I am convinced that, looking around us, we can see how well this system has worked for the last 10 years, as evidenced by the dynamism and the growth of the American economy matched by no one else. Let's extend what already works rather than destroying what already works. Let's be optimists and not pessimists.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues who have spoken on the floor this week, I rise in strong support of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. 
The Senate Finance Committee hearings about IRS agents and supervisors that are completely out-of-control, and who sometimes try to set up honest taxpayers in order to advance their own careers, has made it absolutely clear to every American that the structure and standard operating procedures of the IRS must be corrected--which is exactly what this comprehensive reform legislation will accomplish. 
This bill creates an oversight board consisting of a majority of private sector members to set IRS policy and strategy, and a new independent Inspector General for Tax Administration in the Treasury Department who will be appointed by the President and confirmed by this Senate. The Taxpayer Advocate position, created in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II in 1996, is expanded into a system of local Taxpayer Advocates that guarantees at least one advocate for each state in the union. 
This legislation reverses the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, and allows for the awarding of attorney's fees and civil damages to taxpayers when they have been wronged by the IRS. Relief is also provided to `innocent spouses' who find themselves liable for taxes incurred by their spouse during a marriage. 
Mr. President, this is by no means a comprehensive list of the reforms included in this legislation--it would not be possible to describe them all in the time I have to speak today. It has, in fact, been calculated that there are over 160 reforms to the IRS included in this bill--all with the goal of making the IRS more service oriented and friendly to American taxpayers. It is for the twin goals of IRS structural reform and the protection of innocent taxpayers that I will be voting in favor of this legislation. 
Before concluding Mr. President, I must state that while I hail the Senate's consideration and certain passage of this IRS reform legislation, I believe that it only deals with the symptoms and not with the fundamental disease. The fundamental disease is the Internal Revenue Code written by Congress. The current code is so long, so complicated and so full of loopholes that it is literally out-of-control. 
To deal with the disease, Congress is going to have to deal with the Code. We must either dramatically simplify it or, and this is my preferred course of action, we must repeal the Code lock, stock and barrel and start all over again. We must develop a tax system that is fair, easy for Americans to understand, requires far less money to enforce so that we can have a dramatically smaller IRS, and requires far less money to comply with in fees paid to lawyers and accountants. 
I am absolutely convinced fundamental reform of the Code should be the primary goal of Congress. It is certainly the goal to which I have dedicated and will continue to dedicate my energy and attention.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, was on the floor this morning once again after his letter of last Friday denouncing Microsoft's use of its First Amendment rights to defend itself against an unwarranted attack by the Department of Justice and a handful of state Attorneys General. 
At one level, at least, he went beyond the remarks in his letter with the totally unsubstantiated claim that the many C.E.O.'s who joined with Microsoft last week and again today to plead with the Department of Justice not to inhibit or to postpone the marketing of Windows' 98 were somehow or another coerced into taking this position. As a consequence the Senator from Utah not only questions the right of men and women leading major American corporations to speak out on behalf of their products, but also insults them by saying they acted outside of their own freewill. Mr. President as I have said, there isn't the slightest evidence for this proposition. 
These C.E.O.'s were and are defending the right of a magnificent and innovative American corporation to keep on innovating, to keep on providing newer and better products for the people of the United States, and for that matter, for the people of the world. 
The Senator from Utah buttressed his position by quoting from Judge Robert Bork, who has had a dramatic late-life conversion from free market principles to support willing government intervention in perhaps the most dynamic of all of our free markets. While the Senator from Utah defended Judge Bork's objectivity in this, he failed to note that the judge has recently been hired by Netscape and by others. 
Now, Judge Bork's historic position is perhaps quoted best in just two lines from his book `The Antitrust Paradox,' in which he says `the responsibility of the federal courts for the integrity of virtue of law requires that they take consumer welfare as the sole value that guides antitrust decisions.' The sole value that guides antitrust decisions should be consumer welfare. Mr. President, in this entire debate, we haven't heard a breath, a whisper, or a sentence about consumer welfare. 
This is a campaign by Microsoft's unsuccessful competitors to limit Microsoft's competitive ability to benefit consumers. Consumers aren't complaining, competitors are. 
Judge Bork has dramatically changed positions from that of a consumer advocate to an advocate of government control. I must confess, Mr. President, that there is precedent for his position. There are antitrust cases that might justify some sort of move of this nature by the Department of Justice. In 1945 in a decision relating to ALCOA, the Supreme Court determined that ALCOA's `superior skill, foresight and industry,' were exclusionary of less efficient forms. In 1953, in a case involving the United Shoe Machinery Company, it was decided that United's long line of superior shoe machines and low leasing rates illegally excluded higher cost rivals. Now if that is the theory of antitrust under which Judge Bork is operating, Senator Hatch is operating and the Department of Justice is operating, let them say so. Let them say that they don't want innovation, that they don't like the new developments, and that they do not want advancing technology. 
But, Mr. President, the whole fight in this case is over whether or not we are going to permit the next generation of operating systems to go to market. It is that that is at issue, and only that. 
Finally, Mr. President, in this connection, Senator Hatch ended his remarks with a line from the Rolling Stones. In the interests of fairness and impartiality, I think that we ought to try another one. When I hear Senator Hatch defending Janet Reno and lawyers of the Justice Department I figure he has been listening to `Sympathy for the Devil' a little too much lately. There is another Rolling Stones song that describes what Microsoft does for it's customers: a little hit called `Satisfaction.' Microsoft has been satisfying their customers for 20 years and that's what they ought to continue to do. To the Senator from Utah and everyone at the Justice Department who wants to stand between Microsoft and its customers, all I can say is, fellas, `you can't always get what you want.'

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, 10 days ago in a column appearing in the Washington Post, Charles Krauthammer wrote: 
By ruling Central Europe out of bounds to Russia, NATO expansion takes one of this century's fatal temptations off the table. It is the easiest U.S. foreign policy call of the decade. 
Why is it the easiest foreign policy call of the decade? Because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization for 50 years has preserved the peace of Europe and the peace of the United States. As a result of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Soviet Union literally ceased to exist. All of this was accomplished by a military alliance that never was required to fight or to sacrifice its young men and women in a military conflict within the bounds of that organization. 
Why did the North Atlantic Treaty Organization come into existence in the first place? Because the first half of this century showed that both world wars began in Central Europe because of the weakness, the instability, the unsettled nature of the former empires and the then national states in that part of Europe, occupied almost wholly by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. The West could only be defended by a military organization of which the United States was a part. Behind the magnificent defensive line, the parapets, built by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Western Europe became free, democratic, and prosperous. 
During that 50 years, we and the Western Europeans invested not an inconsiderable amount of money in communicating those ideas of freedom to the people of Central and Eastern Europe through the Voice of America and other such organizations. It is clear now that nothing was desired by the people of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary more than to join the free and prosperous countries of Western Europe. Partly because of our efforts through NATO, partly because of our economic success, and partly from their growing dedication to freedom, they freed themselves--they freed themselves--from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union disappeared and became Russia, a country still unstable, a country with candidates for President in the year 2000 who would desire nothing more than the restoration of the old Soviet Union. 
So the rationale of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to say, no; these countries freed by their own efforts and our own efforts will stay freer. They will be to us as Germany and France and Normandy have been for the last half century. What history teaches us is that a political vacuum filled with weakness and irresolution is a temptation to an aggressor. Countries a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were not such a temptation, even at the height of the power of the Soviet Union. 
Accession to NATO is as close to a guarantee as we can possibly come of the fact that our sons and daughters will not die in Warsaw or in Prague or in Budapest any more than they were required to do so in Oslo or in Paris in the course of the last half century. 
Mr. President, this is the easiest foreign policy call of the decade. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will lend strength to us, a contribution to our own defense, but most importantly the security of countries that have not been secure that want to join us in prosperity and in safety as they have in freedom. 
The amendment of the Senator from Iowa is simply another attempt to make these members second-class members. We have already stated that we made no commitment at all, a zero commitment, to subsidize the national expenses for these countries. How much, if any, we subsidize them in the future is a decision that can and should be made in the future and not in the course of this debate. 
Even more mischievous, in my view, Mr. President, are amendments to say that there will be no further expansion, that we will leave a vacuum unless certain preconditions are made. For more than 50 years the United States of America refused to recognize the annexation of the Baltic republics by the Soviet Union. When their cause was deemed to be a hopeless cause by almost everyone, they, too, have freed themselves. They, too, want at some future date to be a part of NATO. They, too, create a vacuum at the present time in the power structure of Central and of Eastern Europe. 
To pass an amendment that is likely to be proposed by another of my colleagues that singles them out as being countries we will not want to defend or be a part of without special circumstances, in my view, is simply an engraved invitation to some future Russian Government to say: We're coming back in; we don't care about your desire for freedom. You're a part of us whether you like it or not. And, look, the Americans have in effect in the Senate said that's OK. 
That is the essence of instability and of uncertainty, not only for the nations immediately involved but for all of us. 
Certainty created through 50 years by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is the best guarantor of peace. I am convinced we should reject all limiting amendments, admit these three nations, and judge in the future what additional nations should be admitted to NATO--nations, in my opinion, consisting of all of those that become real democracies, real free market countries, with a real desire not only to be a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but to contribute their own strength to it. 
We should reject the Harkin amendment. We should grant the accession of the three countries before us at the present time without further conditions, and in the good faith that their accession will strengthen peace, strengthen their democracy, and strengthen our own security.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier this month, I came to the floor to announce that I was introducing legislation that would authorize the removal of one of two dams on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula in my state. I have always been skeptical about claims that dam removal will have significant enough impact on my state's depleted salmon runs to justify their social and economic costs. I am willing to go along with this limited experiment, however, provided that the removal or significant alteration of any dam on the Columbia-Snake River System will not take place without Congressional approval. 
As I mentioned in my statement, removing the lower Elwha Dam, a relatively small, poorly maintained project, is a small price to pay for the protection of the larger, more productive Columbia-Snake dams that are the lifeblood of our Northwest economy and that in recent years have come under attack by the Clinton-Gore Administration. I hoped that allowing the experiment of dam removal to move forward on the Elwha River would be enough to satisfy the wishes of environmental extremists within this Administration. I should have known that when it comes to environmental issues nothing is ever enough for this Administration. 
I was astounded by the criticism my bill has received. Big City newspapers in Seattle and Portland have attacked the bill. The Sierra Club and other radical groups have attacked the bill. The Administration has attacked the bill, as has my Democratic colleague from Washington state. Needless to say, this criticism is unfounded and shortsighted. 
Let me remind my colleagues and anyone else who has an interest in this subject what my bill does and does not do. It authorizes many millions of dollars to remove the lower Elwha River Dam. It also protects the local water supply in Port Angeles, and protects jobs at a local paper mill. As I have said repeatedly, I am skeptical that dam removal will result in a significant increase in Elwha River salmon runs because: (1) many rivers on the Olympic Peninsula that have never been dammed are not teeming with salmon; (2) the salmon crisis challenge our coastal rivers as well and yet none of those rivers have dams on them; and (3) Puget Sound is now home to endangered salmon runs, and, of course, there are no major dams on Puget Sound. Yet, despite these reservations, I am still willing to go forward with this experiment--it's worth the money to see the results on the ground. 
But rural communities of Eastern Washington are so concerned about how this legislation impacts their livelihood--many in Eastern Washington believe removal of the Elwha River dams is a precursor to destroying dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers . So my bill contains protections for these communities by requiring congressional approval for any destruction, or significant modification, of dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. 
I should point out that for several years federal agencies have taken unprecedented and unauthorized actions to alter significantly and limit the effectiveness of these projects without any input from Congress. For the most part, my bill allows these agencies to continue implementing the present series of unauthorized actions. It simply prevents the executive branch from taking additional unilateral actions to modify these projects without Congressional approval. 
Why it should be so controversial when Elwha dam removal will have been the subject of two bills in Congress, I fail to understand. Columbia and Snake River dam removal almost certainly requires Congressional approval now, under present law--my bill just provides reassurances for eastern Washington. 
I think this is also an appropriate time to remind all of those who are interested in this legislation--the Port Angeles community, Eastern Washington, environmentalists, the Administration, and Northwest congressional officeholders--what I am for, and what I am not for in regards to management of our region's environment, and the Columbia/Snake Rivers system. Here are the things that I am for: 
Salmon: On this one, everyone has the same goal--more salmon. We just have different approaches for accomplishing this goal. I want more salmon in our rivers, and I want solutions to our Northwest salmon crisis that result in more salmon and less conflict among the region's various interests. 
Clear, Scientific Conclusions: We need clear, scientific conclusions that guide the region toward responsible salmon recovery measures. 
Hydropower Production: Hydro is the cleanest and most cost-effective way to produce large amounts of electricity. Our hydropower asset is the backbone of our Northwest economy. I don't want to lose that `leg up' that we have on other regions, nor do I want to resort to less environmentally friendly sources of power production to replace power lost because of dam removal. 
Irrigation: Eastern Washington is America's pantry and refrigerator. Our farmlands produce dozens of different crops that feed the nation and the world. Before the dams, Central Washington had few farms, and was mostly a dustbowl. Irrigated farmland has turned this part of the nation into some of the world's most productive farmland. 
River Traffic: We get a large share of those crops to market by barging them down the river. Studies show that it would take 700,000 more trucks each year to get farm products to market if dam removal eliminated barge traffic. 
Recreation: I want people to have access to the river for boating, fishing and other recreation activities. 
Protecting our Communities from Severe Floods: Without question, the dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers were the single biggest reason why Portland and other Columbia River communities did not incur untold millions of dollars in additional damages from the record winter rains our area has seen over the past three years.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am given to understand from the debate on the floor this afternoon that I have made many new friends along with the Senator from Georgia. Senators on the other side of the aisle who were totally unable to find a good word for his bill over the course of the last month or two have suddenly said how desperately they wish to vote for his bill if it were not for the Gorton amendment having been added to it. 
Mr. President, the Gorton bill basically takes $10 billion a year of Federal money for our public schools, of which about $2 billion is used by bureaucrats today, and says that we prefer classrooms to bureaucrats. We would like to allow each State, if it wished to do so, to say that the whole $10 billion went into our schools rather than to have roughly $2 billion of it siphoned off by Federal and State bureaucrats. 
I suppose it is perfectly appropriate for Members of this body to believe that without those bureaucrats in Washington, DC, and in our State capitals, all of that money would be wasted; that our school board members, our superintendents, our principals, our teachers, and our parents, don't know what they are doing and that we must set national priorities for them and tell them there are certain things they must spend the money--that we have collected from them and returned to them--on. 
That, however, has not been the argument against the Gorton amendment so far. More than one Member this afternoon opposing it talked about how it damaged disabled children. It doesn't include the aid for disabled children. It is not affected by it at all. It is totally irrelevant to that subject. Others have said how it destroys the fight against drugs in our public schools, or for safety, or for mathematics education, and the like. 
Mr. President, it may very well be that, for example, the principal debater against this, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, knows more about what the Boston schools need 
than does the Boston school committee, but I am reasonably confident that he does not know more about what the Wenatchee, WA, school district needs than do the teachers and parents and school board members in Wenatchee, WA. 
That amendment takes about one-third of the money, $10 billion out of $30 billion a year that goes to the Department of Education here in Washington, DC, for common school education, and it says that States, like that system of Federal regulation and the narrow Federal categorical aid program, are perfectly free to retain it without change, but that those States that think that either their States or their local school districts might possibly do better without those Federal regulations and with more money will have that option for a 5-year period. The State can adopt the policy under which it is the State educational agency that makes the determination as to how this money can be used, or the States can opt. 
It is my preference, and was the only option a year ago when I first proposed it and this amendment was agreed to, that each of the 14,000 school districts in the United States can make those choices for themselves. It may be that the Wenatchee school district, or any other, will feel that the precise requirements and the exact amount of money in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act is what the Wenatchee school district ought to spend on that subject. But if it were allowed to make those choices, that school district might decide that it wanted to spend more money on that subject from the Federal Government, and perhaps in a slightly different way than the set of Federal regulations set out for every school district in the country, and it might, if it is very fortunate, decide that it could get by with less and put more of that money into teaching English, or mathematics, or computer sciences. 
Mr. President, I suppose one can say that to allow that kind of discretion would be disastrous to our schools; that there is no way that it is appropriate for us to trust those local school board members wisely to spend the money collected here in Washington, DC, and send it back for school purposes. But I believe that if there is to be an argument against that, it ought to be on the basis of what the amendment says and not the statements of those who have not read it. 
To repeat. It does essentially two things. It takes this $10 billion and says each State may continue the present system, may have a State-based system or may have a local-based system for a period of 5 years, at the end of which time, I think, perhaps we might know a little bit more about what works best. 
It does something else. It says that this bill stays in effect only as long as Congress keeps, modestly at least, increasing the amount of money it puts into our schools. I would have thought many on the other side of the aisle would have liked that effective guarantee, a real incentive for us to do our job for education. Evidently, however, there is in this body a view not widely shared in the United States, a view that the present system is so close to perfect that we do not dare experiment with it; that we are doing so well with our Federal policies, that we are so successful that we should not experiment with them at all. For those who believe that bureaucrats are more important than classrooms, or at the very least that bureaucrats here in Washington, DC, should run our classrooms, and that they should retain literally billions of dollars that could otherwise be spent in the classroom, opposition to the amendment was appropriate and taken well. 
But for those who believe that there is not only great concern, perhaps the greatest concern, for children in a given part of the United States on the part of those children's parents and their teachers, their principals, their school board members, and a degree of competence and knowledge about what those communities and schools need, this amendment offers a new chance and a real experiment. It isn't permanent. Can I say that there is no question but that it will be a better system? Of course not. I think it will be. I am sure we will learn when there are States that accept each of these three alternatives. 
But to say that it is some kind of disaster, to say that without this guidance, without these requirements from the Department of Education in Washington, DC, without our wisdom, 100 Members of this body, with all we know about schools, that we will irretrievably damage the educational fabric of this country is simply wrong. I regret having deprived my friend and colleague from Georgia of so many friends and so many supporters. I strongly support his bill, as he does mine. 
But it does seem to me that there ought to be enough tolerance in this body, enough faith in the American system that we are willing for a period of time to let some States in this country try to operate under State-mandated rules and others to let school districts make their own decisions. The amendment that a small majority of this body passed yesterday does just exactly that, nothing less and nothing more.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last fall during the debate of the Labor, Education appropriations bill, I introduced an amendment to consolidate more than a dozen Federal aid programs for education from kindergarten through 12th grade into a single block grant, with the block grant going to each individual school district across the United States. The amendment had three goals: To see to it that each school district receive more money than it does at the present time by sending directly to the school districts money now kept by the Department of Education for administrative purposes and money kept by State educational agencies for administrative purposes. The second goal was to reduce the flood, the blizzard, of paperwork imposed on all of our school districts across the country with respect to dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of separate programs directly or indirectly aimed at the education of our children between kindergarten and 12th grade. And the third and philosophical reason for the amendment was the belief that the professional educators, the parents, and the elected school board members in each State and school district in this country had the education of their children close to their hearts and really knew, in each community, more about what the children of that community required in connection with education policy than did any person in Washington, DC, whether a bureaucrat in the Department of Education or a U.S. Senator in this body. 
Perhaps the most difficult conclusion for any of us here to reach is that maybe we don't know as much as do people at home about the immediate problems and challenges that they face in a wide range of areas--in this case, most particularly, education. So it was an attempt to allow 10,000 flowers to bloom, to allow each individual school district far more discretion than it has at the present time to determine where Federal aid could best be used. After all, we only come up with 6 to 8 percent of the money that our schools spend. We don't have a right to come up with 50 or 60 percent of the rules and regulations and forms with which our schools must contend. That burden lessens the ability of teachers to teach and administrators to administer and school board members to set policies. 
Somewhat to my surprise, that amendment was passed by a vote of 51 to 49. It was objected to, partly on substantive grounds and partly on procedural grounds. It had not been the subject of hearings. The House of Representatives was uncomfortable with it. The President was opposed. And it was eventually dropped in the conference committee on that appropriations bill. Since then, however, it has been a matter of major discussion among school officials all across the United States. It has been the subject of hearings here in the U.S. Senate, conducted by my distinguished friend and colleague, Senator Frist from Tennessee, on a bipartisan basis. I have spent countless hours talking to educators on the subject and listening to both their praise and to their concerns. As a consequence, this amendment is somewhat changed from the previous amendment. This amendment will last for 5 years, but its effective date will be delayed in order to give the people of each State a very real choice in the way in which they receive their Federal aid for education. 
We heard the representative of at least one State school superintendent say that he liked the present system. We heard several State school superintendents say how much more they could do with the money dramatically to reform education policy if the money came to each of the 50 States, to their Governor or to their superintendent of schools. Many of the outside intellectuals and academics in the field of education feel that it is at the State level that true education reform is taking place. 
We hear from many school board members--I hear from many of them in my home State and so do other Members--that they liked my original proposal to get rid of both bureaucracies and allow each individual school district to make these decisions. 
So this amendment gives each State a choice. The State legislature in the next year may elect to continue the present system, it may elect to take the money at the State level going through whatever educational establishment that State has established, or it may elect, either positively or by taking no action, to allow the money to go directly through to school districts. 
Senator Frist will offer a second-degree amendment allowing that choice to be rescinded to change the amendment I think friendly to the proposition. 
As a consequence, we will be able to determine whether or not the proposal I made last year is a significant benefit to education, whether the best system is one in which each State makes its own choices, much as we have done with respect to welfare reform, or whether the present system is best, because there will be States that make each of these three decisions. 
I hope that this will turn this proposal into a bipartisan proposal. I am not sure why anyone should oppose that triple option allowing a different way of doing things. Only if we regarded the present education system as perfect should we reject an experiment of this sort. 
The second objection, the second apprehension that was close to universal, was the proposition that if we went to a block grant, if we combined all of these ideas into a block grant, Congress would immediately lose interest in education and the block grant would inevitably decline and that the money wouldn't be there for schools. I believe the interest in education here to be high enough so that that would not have taken place, but the concern was very real. 
In responding to that concern, we have set authorization levels for the 5 years during which this experiment will take place, each of which rises modestly in each of those years consistent with the balanced budget agreement and the projections of the freeze under which discretionary spending will operate. This proposal says that if in any year we don't meet that authorization level, the whole experiment falls and ends, and we go back to the present system. We have guaranteed not only a continuation of effort, we have guaranteed a modest increase in that effort over the years. 
Finally, we have a hold harmless under which school districts say that no school will receive less money if they elect one of the two systems other than continuing the status quo than they would have received otherwise, with the distribution of title I money based on the number of title I eligible students fundamentally, bilingual money based on the number of bilingual students fundamentally, and a distribution of the balance on the basis of the prosperity and poverty of a given State. 
I think we have something very positive for education here, a system that will get more money into the classroom, will allow more experimentation, will allow us to find out whether the present system is the best system we can come up with or a State-based system or a local-based system. 
At this point, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues of both parties to look at this very carefully, not to judge it necessarily on the basis of the way in which they judged last year's proposal but to judge it on the basis of whether or not they have a sufficient trust in their own elected school board members, elected by the same people who elect us, to make better judgments, in some cases, about their schools than we can make here on a one-size-fits-all basis in Washington, DC.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am saddened by the response of Senator Kennedy. This amendment was revised very substantially after consultation, wide consultation with people thoughtfully interested in education. 
By the terms of the amendment, any State that wants to continue the present system and thinks it is best may do so, any State that wants to operate its Federal aid through its State educational entity may do so, and any State that thinks that education will best be conducted at the local level will be permitted to do so. How that destroys programs or hurts education is beyond my understanding. 
In January, Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the General Accounting Office came before the Senate budget task force and said in three areas of education 15 Federal departments and agencies administer 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs; 11 Federal departments and agencies administer more than 90 early childhood programs; and 9 Federal departments and agencies administer 86 teacher-training programs. 
Twenty programs are consolidated into this block grant for those States that wish it. It takes about one-third of all of the money that the U.S. Department of Education spends on education from kindergarten through 12th grade. To say that once we reduce the rulemaking functions of the U.S. Department of Education we are going to destroy education is to say that neither State education agencies nor local school districts nor superintendents nor teachers either know what they are doing or care about what they are doing. 
That is simply wrong. They know more and they care more because they are right there with our children. If it does not work, it will go out of existence. Any State that does not want it does not have to take it. I believe this is an amendment that ought to be adopted unanimously. I regret the opposition of the Senator from Massachusetts. What we are doing is improving education and getting more dollars into the classroom, not less. 
Mr. President, I yield such time as he wishes to the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend from North Dakota makes two arguments. One, a philosophical argument against the abolition of the Department of Education, based on the philosophy that there is a function of the Department of Education in Washington, DC. That, however, is not an argument against this amendment since this amendment does not abolish the Department. It takes only about one-third of the money that it is spending in K through 12 education. 
The second argument the Senator from North Dakota makes is that it is absolutely essential for the success of our educational efforts that there be very strict rules coming from the Department of Education to every school district in the United States. That would be a forceful argument if we had been a tremendous `signal' success in these policies. Nothing indicates that we have been. It is one of the reasons we are debating education policy here today. 
What I proposed is an opportunity to try three experiments: Continue the present system, allow the States to do it, or allow local school districts to do it. I remain puzzled that anyone should say that we are so successful today that we can't experiment, we can't change. Let's try for a while three different systems and see which one works the best. Competition always ends up with the best results. 
I yield back the remaining time.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1768 in a letter to George Wythe, Thomas Jefferson wrote, 
No other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness . . . Preach a crusade against ignorance; establish and improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen know that the people alone can protect us against the evils [of misgovernment]. 
As a nation we have long recognized the importance of education of the future well-being of our children and our nation. A quality education is vital in an increasingly competitive global environment and indeed, as Jefferson notes, to the preservation of our democracy. Every Senator undoubtedly wants to do everything in their power to improve the educational opportunities for all children. It is one of our highest priorities in the U.S. Senate. 
As many of my colleagues may recall, last year I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Senate Labor, Health and Human Services Education appropriations bill that consolidated most federally funded K-12 education programs, and sent that money directly to local school districts free from the mandates and regulations imposed on our schools by Washington, DC, bureaucrats. The Senate approved the amendment but, at the administration's insistence, it was stripped from the final bill. 
For most of this half century Washington, DC, has been dominated by people who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control exercised by Washington, DC, is the best way to solve problems, including those in the classroom. This approach has not worked. As Washington, DC, has taken power and authority from local school districts, our schools have not improved. But, old habits die hard. The belief in centralized power is still very much alive. When I proposed my amendment last year, every single Democrat in the Senate opposed it and the President strongly criticized the approach of returning money and authority over education to our school districts. 
Why is the status quo no longer acceptable? There are a multitude of reasons. As many of you know, the results of the Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) were recently announced. Unfortunately, those graduating from our high schools did not fare well. Twelfth grade students from the United States did not achieve at a level I would call acceptable, with scores below the international average in both science and mathematics. 
Is it because the United States has not been devoting sufficient resources to education? The facts don't bear out that assessment. Resources devoted to education have been increasing in constant dollars almost yearly for the last 25 years, but there has been no significant change in the achievement of students. 
What do we have to show for our investment? We have a web of literally hundreds of Federal education programs woven throughout 39 Federal departments and agencies and totaling $73.1 billion in 1997. I wish I had a comprehensive list of all the Federal education programs to show you, but the Department of Education doesn't know exactly how many there are. 
In January of this year Dr. Carlotta Joyner of the GAO appeared before the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force and presented us with a graphic that highlights the web of Federal education programs in only the three areas of education: At Risk and Delinquent Youth, Early Childhood programs, and Teacher training programs. What this chart shows is that 15 Federal departments and agencies administer 127 At Risk and Delinquent Youth programs, 11 Federal departments and agencies administer more than 90 Early Childhood programs, and 9 Federal departments and agencies administer 86 Teacher Training programs. 
It is no wonder that more and more, our states and local school districts are being suffocated by a tidal wave of papers, forms and programs, each of which no doubt began with good intentions. The net result of this tidal wave, however, is precisely what makes it difficult to set priorities in each of the many varied states and school districts across the country to determine that which will best serve their students. I firmly believe that the elected school board members, parents, superintendents and principals, as well as governors and legislatures, are dedicated to providing the best possible education for school children that they possibly can, and that they are better able to make decisions about what is best for their students than are Members of Congress or bureaucrats in the Department of Education. 
It is extremely arrogant of us here in this body to set detailed requirements for very specific education programs that apply to children all across the United States. It's wrong to believe that Congress or the Department of Education has all the answers to the variety of problems our schools and educators face. Why should a bureaucrat in Washington, DC, decide what's best for the children in Washington State? They don't know Walla Walla from Wenatchee from Woodinville. 
Over the past several months I have had the opportunity to meet with parents and educators from across Washington State and the Nation. They have expressed a great deal of concern about the stifling nature of the rules and regulations that come along with the myriad of federal education programs in existence. In fact, several have commented that although school districts receive only about 7 percent of their funding from the Federal Government, with that money comes 50 percent of the rules and regulations they must comply with. 
A perfect example of the crushing nature of Federal rules, regulations and paperwork comes from a program I didn't even include in my amendment. The Bellevue School District, a suburban school district east of Seattle, has gathered all the paperwork necessary to begin, just begin, the file they are required to keep for special education students under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Placed end to end, this paperwork extends for almost 40 feet. 40 Feet! We have allowed bureaucrats in Washington, DC, to impose half or more than half of the rules and regulations that so often frustrate innovation and success in our schools. 
Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that Congress must do more to free State and local officials from the burden placed on them by the Federal Government to educating America's children. We must be willing to admit that somebody else may know a little bit more than we do about this subject. My firm belief is that the wisdom needed to educate our children lies in States 
and individual school districts--with parents at home, with teachers in the classroom, with principals in the schools, and with school board members who, almost without exception, are public-spirited citizens who have run for election to a job that does not pay or pays very little. We must keep in mind that the same citizenry who elected us to the U.S. Senate also elected our school board members. It is unlikely that they were wise in electing us and ignorant of their own interests in picking their school board members. 
I have listened to educators from around the country and have applied those lessons to the crafting of this amendment. My amendment makes several changes that address the concerns of those who have been kind enough to take the time and work with me and my office to improve upon the work begun during last year's appropriations process. 
First, there were concerns that any attempt to block grant education funds to local communities was simply a back door attempt to cut funding. My amendment makes it crystal clear that is not what this effort is about. My amendment authorizes specific levels of funding through fiscal year 2003, targets that appropriators must meet in order for the block grants to continue. If these targets are not met, we would revert to the status quo. 
Others have expressed concern that my amendment is an attempt to close the Department of Education. Nothing could be further from the truth. My amendment is not about abolishing the Department of Education--my amendment is about giving communities the flexibility they need to educate our children. Even after enactment of my amendment, there would be plenty of work left for the Department. My amendment does not even touch on the Department's responsibilities with respect to higher education. And even though my amendment includes more than 20 Federal education programs, that is but a fraction of the total number of education programs administered by the Department of Education, not to mention the Federal Government as a whole. 
Concerns have also been expressed about the targeting of Federal funds to disadvantaged students. The concern is that because Federal funding often is targeted at a specific population, block granting funds and allowing States and school districts to decide how those funds are spent will mean those populations will no longer be served. Well, this mentality is what led to the creation of the quagmire of education programs we find ourselves wallowing in today. My amendment retains specification for what populations the Bilingual Education and Education for the Disadvantaged (Title I, Part A), funds are to be spent, but it leaves up to States and school districts the method by which those populations are best served. As for the list of 20 Federal programs, my amendment outlines a series of allowable uses such as hiring new teachers, magnet schools, charter schools, and combating illiteracy, which give local officials flexibility in designing reforms to improve the achievement of students. The total amount of funding that gets to the classroom will be considerably greater because so much less will get lost in the gears of administration at two, three or four different levels of bureaucracy between Washington, DC, and the classroom. As I've stated previously, we cannot assume that Washington, DC, knows best when it comes to educating the diverse population that exists in America today. 
I have heard comments that different states have different opinions about how they should receive federal funds. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee Education Task Force, chaired by my good friend and colleague Senator Frist, I had a chance to hear from Frank Brogan, Commissioner of Education from the State of Florida, and Henry Der, Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction from the State of California. Mr. Brogan and Mr. Der have widely different opinions about the efficacy of involving the Federal Government in decisions regarding education in their States. Mr. Brogan states,  
Congress should identify priority areas and allow States to designate the dollars for specific programs. 
With Education, we are already beginning to see States becoming living laboratories, testing varied programs and options. If left to pursue reform without added Federal burdens and interference, States can learn from the success and mistakes of others, . . . with the freedom to emulate some programs as models and/or discard those that are ineffective. 
Mr. Der followed Mr. Brogan with, 
We submit to you that the roads toward devolution will result in less opportunities for those with special needs and will retard the leadership role that the U.S. Department of Education has played, as well as undermine the accountability that we need to build into our education programs.' 
Therefore, it became clear to me that States should have a choice concerning how they receive their Federal funds, and my amendment gives them that choice. My amendment says that States will have three options with respect to how they receive Federal education funds. Simply put, a State legislature, with the concurrence of the Governor, will choose from one of three methods for receiving Federal funds: (1) States can continue to receive Federal education funds through current categorical programs; (2) States can receive Federal education funds in a block grant to the State Educational Agency; or (3) States can direct the Federal Government to send Federal education funds directly to their Local Educational Agencies. 
There are also provisions in my amendment that respond to other concerns about the immediate financial impact on States and school districts. My amendment includes a 100 percent hold harmless, so that no State or school district will receive less than what they received before enactment of this legislation. Further, there is a provision which says that for those States receiving a multiyear grant through one of the programs included in the block grant, that multiyear grant will be funded through to completion in order to provide an appropriate transition from one process to another. 
Finally, my amendment encourages accountability by requiring States and school districts to collect information about how Federal funds are spent, as well as involving parents and other members of the public in debates over how funds will be utilized. 
As you can see, my amendment is based on the principal that with additional authority and money schools would receive from this reform, our teachers, parents, principals, and school 
boards would be inspired to do even more for our children. They would not, as some suggested during debate on this issue last year, be inspired to build swimming pools. They would be inspired to make sure that every child in their community receives the best education possible. While I think this example shows the fundamental difference between the approach I advocate, and that of the administration, I just have to ask this question: Does anyone really believe that there are parents, teachers or school board members in America who would rather use scarce education dollars for swimming pools instead of providing a quality education for their children? 
On February 10 of this year, I had the opportunity to visit the Union Gap Elementary School and learn about the tremendous work they are doing, in the words of their Superintendent Bob McLaughlin, to `heal' their children's reading difficulties. 
More than three years ago, Dr. McLaughlin became painfully aware that the Union Gap School District did not have a program to assist its students who were having difficulty learning to read. Dr. McLaughlin then took it upon himself to search out a program which would be both affordable and helpful to the students. During the 1995-96 school year. Dr. McLaughlin discovered the Read-Write program and soon thereafter the program underwent a 10-week test in the school. 
The test was so successful that at the conclusion of the 10-week test run the school board adopted the program and fully implemented it for the 1996-97 school year. Since the program has been implemented, significant gains have become evident. 
Dr. McLaughlin also took the time to explain to me his previous experience as a principal at a neighboring high school upon which brought him to the conclusion something should be done about reading comprehension at the elementary level. As a high school principal, Dr. McLaughlin would continually see students entering his school unprepared to read and write effectively, and in many instances no where near grade level. The frustration he experienced seeing these kids struggle through high school without the necessary tools drove Dr. McLaughlin to seek a solution at Union Gap Elementary. As Dr. McLaughlin and other teachers at the elementary school know, once you teach a child to read that child has gained a skill he or she retained for a lifetime of enrichment. 
This instance is a clear example of the innovative work school districts are engaging in to improve the education of their students. Under the Gorton Amendment, Dr. McLaughlin and his school board would have the flexibility to expand this program if that is what they felt was in the best interest of their students. I doubt seriously that Dr. McLaughlin would consider tennis courts or swimming pools to be a priority. 
This issue boils down to each Senator asking if he or she believes schools will be improved through more control from Washington, DC, or by giving more control to parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members? I believe our best hope for improving the education of our children is to put the American people in charge of their local schools. 
Mr. President, I wonder if the minority manager will agree to a unanimous consent agreement that I have 3 additional minutes on this amendment? I do see my colleague from Washington here. We are going forward with that amendment, and I would like just 3 minutes further to speak on this subject.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from North Dakota and I, together, less than 2 months ago, voted with 94 other Members of this Senate for a bill relating to transportation covering somewhat more than four times as many billions of dollars as this amendment does. Unlike the House of Representatives, we included no specific programs in that transportation bill. We decided there was a national purpose for transportation but that the priorities as to how that money for highways ought to be spent should be set by States--generally speaking, not by elected officials in those States, but usually by a highway bureaucracy. 
No one said that, because we weren't telling the States what roads to build, there was no national purpose and we should abandon transportation as a national issue. Yet the Senator from North Dakota says that, rather than give a three-way option to States with respect to $10 billion a year in education money, it would be philosophically more consistent to abandon the field because, after all, the States might set different priorities; maybe the States and local school districts don't care about drugs or don't care about disadvantaged students. 
Mr. President, that is a basic philosophical difference between us. The thought being expressed to me--that elected school board members and principals and teachers and parents and even State legislators don't care much about education or about education priorities--boggles the mind. We are the only people who do so? We are the only people who can set the way in which national priorities are carried out? We and bureaucrats at the Department of Education? Let me tell you, we come up with 7 percent of the money and 50 or 60 percent of the rules? In one field not covered by this, where the Senator from North Dakota did support me, we give 9 percent of the money for disabled education and we set rules that are so stringent that some school board members are saying they are going to defy those rules because they cannot provide for a safe environment for their students. In title I, the forms are exceeded only by IDEA. 
This proposal will allow schools to spend more money on disadvantaged students, more money on bilingual students, and do it in a way that suits the particular needs of the districts, if the State elects to do so. Any State that agrees with the position of Senator Dorgan is perfectly free to keep the present system. Any State that feels it can do a better job will be allowed to do a better job. And any State that feels its elected school board members can do a better job will be allowed to do that. 
Maybe Senator Dorgan is right. If so, we will learn by experiment. But unless we feel--with him and Senator Kennedy--that the present system is working magnificently, that our system of education is so good that it doesn't need to be changed or experimented with at all, we should reject this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the Gorton-Frist amendment is based on two philosophical principles. The first of those principles is that the present system under which 7 percent of the dollars going into education come from the Federal Government, together with 50 percent of all of the rules and regulations under which that education is provided, is not necessarily either in theory or in practice the best way to set policies for our public schools or to fund those public schools. 
It is based also on the philosophy that parents and teachers and principals and superintendents and elected school board members all across the United States not only care more about the children in their trust but are better able to set the educational policies for their children in their schools than are bureaucrats in Washington, DC, or even Senators in the U.S. Senate. 
The Gorton-Frist amendment, however, forces these two philosophical distinctions or principles on no one. Under this amendment, any State that likes the present system of Federal control is authorized to retain it. Any State that believes educational policy should be set at the State capital through a State school board or Governor or State superintendent of public instruction is free to adopt such a system. And any State that believes, as we do, that local control and local spending policies are best, is free to adopt that policy. 
We also guarantee that no State will lose money under this amendment. I commend it to the President and to the Members of the Senate.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, as we debate the most important issue we will discuss all year on the Senate floor--our children's education--I would like to take a moment to recognize Washington State's Teacher of the Year, Ms. Yvonne Ullas. A first grade teacher at Naches Primary School in Yakima, Washington, Ms. Ullas is being honored in Washington, DC to recognize her dedication to her profession and innovation in the classroom. We think we have a challenging job in the Senate, but every day Ms. Ullas is charged with stimulating the minds of 24 active first graders. 
The Naches primary school has prepared this book with their advice for President Clinton and have asked that I send it over to the White House. Many of the children commented that if they were President they would make sure our kids have the best education. I will make sure the words of advice reach the President. I know Ms. Ullas serves as an example of excellence in education and of the dedication of many people in our local communities to ensuring a bright future for our children.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately resume consideration of H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill. Under the previous order, this Senator will be recognized at 9:30 a.m. to offer an amendment with respect to block grants. Members who have remaining amendments to the Coverdell bill are encouraged to come to the floor to offer and debate those amendments. Senators are reminded that any votes ordered this morning with respect to pending amendments will be stacked to occur at approximately 3 p.m. Further votes will occur throughout today's session as we attempt to complete action on this important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, this is the message from the majority leader, and I want to emphasize the last point. It is his intention that we finish all amendments and debate on final passage of this bill before the end of the session today. So those who have amendments should come to the floor and offer them in order, after the debate on my own is complete. 
Now, Mr. President, I ask recognition in order to present an amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the 1984 Shipping Act significantly brought openness and competition into the field of ocean shipping, a field dominated for decades by cartels, by fixed prices, by underhanded competition, and by, very frequently, the victimization of those who ship their goods by sea. 
This 1998 set of amendments to the Shipping Act further opens up the process to competition and allows the business of ocean shipping to operate far more like most of the rest of the free market in the United States, with one exception. If you are a large shipper of goods by sea, sophisticated, a major customer, you deal directly with the ocean carrier, and those relationships with the ocean carrier are made much more flexible, much more subject to competition, by this bill. 
If, on the other hand, you are a modest shipper, a small or medium-sized shipper, perhaps someone new to the business of exporting your goods from the United States of America, you don't, as a general practice, deal directly with the ocean carrier, you deal with a middleman, a consolidator, a freight forwarder. That small businessman in the various ports of the United States gathers together shipments to the same place from a number of different shippers and makes the arrangements with the ocean carrier. 
As this bill was debated and reported from the Committee on Commerce, it treated both of these groups in an identical fashion. Each got the benefits of the bill; each got the benefits of competition. 
Somewhere, however, between the Commerce Committee and the floor, the big boys got together behind closed doors, and a 
combination of the ocean carriers and the longshoremen's unions, working with a handful of Senators, determined that the small business people would not get these advantages, that they would continue to have to operate, under most circumstances, under the requirements of the 1984 act. 
Under the 1984 act, they were treated identically. If this bill passes without my amendment, they will no longer be treated identically. The small shipper will be discriminated against. The small businessman who is a freight forwarder will be discriminated against. The big guys will get away with something. 
It is curious, Mr. President, that neither the small shippers nor the freight forwarders were included in the negotiations that led to the revised bill, the substantive bill that is before us, as against the bill that came out of the Commerce Committee. The big boys got together, shafted the small business people on both sides, and now present this bill to you with the statement, `Take it or leave it; it's tough, but we've made a deal with the longshoremen's unions because they think that they may not get some of the business from these small businessmen, and you're just simply going to have to take it that way.' 
I don't think that is the way the laws ought to be made. I don't think that is the way we ought to deal as Senators. We make wonderful speeches at home, all of us, about the sanctity of small business, but here we are asked to discriminate against small business and in favor of big business. 
If we adopt my amendment, we will simply put this bill back into the same condition in which it found itself when it was reported by the Commerce Committee--everyone treated equally, everyone the beneficiary of a freer market than we have at the present time--and we will have done our duty to all of our constituents and not just to those who are able to afford expensive lobbyists in Washington, DC. 
The bill, in its present form, is unfair to small businesses. It discriminates against small businesses. The bill as reported from the Commerce Committee did not do so. We should restore provisions that the Commerce Committee saw fit to include in the bill. 
Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my friend from Louisiana makes a curious set of arguments. The single word he used most in his remarks was `compromise,' that this provision is now the result of a compromise of 4 years' work. No; this provision is not the result of 4 years of work. This provision is the result of a discussion that took place after this bill was reported from the Commerce Committee, after all of the open public hearings and all the open discussion. And what kind of compromise was it? Well, it was a compromise between the big unions, the big carriers and maybe some of the big shippers. It isn't a compromise that involved its victims. 
No representative of small shippers was in the room where this `compromise' was made. None of the small businessmen who were middlemen were in the room when this `compromise' was made. A curious compromise, I must say, when the victims were excluded from it, after having been a part of everything that went on for the 4 years of work on this bill up through and including its report from the Commerce Committee. No, this was not a compromise; this was a backroom deal, the worst kind of backroom deal. 
The Senator from Louisiana says, `Carefully, carefully crafted.' `Killer amendment.' Strange. I don't see any dissent on the Commerce Committee, Republicans or Democrats, with the bill in its original form. How can it be a killer amendment? 
Does the Senator from Louisiana mean that, if we pass this amendment, every Member of his party will then filibuster the bill? Simply because we have not done the will of the longshoremen's unions, they will give up competition and open shipping, lock, stock and barrel across the board? Well, if that is what he means--if that is what they mean, let them say so. It isn't going to kill the bill over here; and I do not think it will kill the bill over there. 
What do outsiders say about it? Today's Journal of Commerce, the newspaper that deals with business, endorses this bill. It says: 
Today, the Senate is expected to approve a bill that boosts competition and makes it easier for shipping lines and their customers to operate. 
In one respect, however, this bill actually limits competition by denying freight consolidators--middlemen--full opportunity under the new law. * * * * * 
Lately, however, middlemen have become an important export conduit and even a threat to the status quo. Not surprisingly, it was the major shipping lines and labor unions that teamed up to deny to consolidators private contracting privileges. 
In other words, they have given themselves the ability to do business in a way they now want to deny to others in the same business. The only difference is the people who made this `compromise' are big and the ones who are victimized are small. 
This amendment is consistent with the philosophy of the bill. It was included in the bill in every stage to this point. It is backed by everyone who deals with this issue objectively. It will not kill the bill, unless there are 41 Members here who will simply vote to kill the bill on behalf of one small set of labor unions who want a monopoly. And I do not think that will happen. 
We should do the right thing and pass the amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few moments ago, the manager of this bill had a vehicle for a wide-ranging debate over Federal education policy and received unanimous consent to withdraw from consideration the Gregg amendment. 
Because the Gregg amendment was identical to an amendment that I offered last year in debate over the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and because the Gregg amendment perhaps created more interest on the part of school authorities, school board members, superintendents, principals, and teachers, than any other amendment being debated this week, it seemed important to me to explain to educators all across the country why the debate on the Gregg amendment or the Gregg-Gorton amendment will not be pursued during the course of the debate on this Coverdell A+ bill. 
Violence in our schools--assaults, the carrying into schools of guns and other dangerous weapons, disruptive behavior that threatens the safety and security of the educational environment, disruptive behavior that detracts from the educational experience of all students--is an increasingly serious problem. 
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the purposes of which are not only praiseworthy but in some respects essential in guaranteeing to all students, including even the most severely disabled, the opportunity for a public education that will allow them to live to the maximum of their capacities, nevertheless includes within it a set of provisions relating to safety, to discipline, and to the orderly nature of our classrooms that amounts to a clear and explicit double standard and, in an increasing number of cases, severely detracts from the educational atmosphere for all of the students of such a school. 
In Seattle, late last month, a student designated `disabled' attacked other students with a knife on a schoolbus. In Louisiana, a teacher was attacked and hospitalized. In several States, as we know, assaults with guns have actually resulted in the deaths of students and of teachers. In Danbury, CT, parents picketed a school and withdrew their children from the school because two students were suspended for a mere 10 days for bringing a gun into the school atmosphere.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the editorial is correct; it is correct in its understanding and it is correct in its policy judgments. 
In Louisiana, the Shreveport Times reports in an article about the Gregg-Gorton amendment that Louisiana Department of Education revealed that there were 22,790 out-of-school suspensions in special education in the 1996-97 school year. . . . The Bossier Parish school board led the fight for more local control by signing a resolution last week that supports Gorton and Gregg. . . . Bossier School superintendent Jane Smith vowed that if a special education student posed a considerable safety threat, such as bringing a gun to class, the parish would treat him or her like a regular education student regardless of the Federal laws. 
In other words, Mr. President, we have a law, we have a statute, we have a set of regulations that actually causes a school superintendent to say that this is so bad, this is so dangerous to the students I am attempting to educate that I will simply defy the law. The Seattle school district hasn't taken that position. 
In Danbury, Connecticut, parents had to picket and take their kids out of school because of the requirements of the statute that literally sets up a double standard. School districts have plenary authority over safety and discipline and an appropriate educational atmosphere for all of their regular students. They now have almost none--very limited rights to oppose discipline on students denominated `disabled.' And don't think that this country isn't full of imaginative lawyers who can come up with a plausible case to denominate a student `disabled.' In fact, often they use the very violent or safety-threatening activity of the student to demonstrate that a particular student is disabled. 
The Gorton-Gregg amendment was very simple and very short. I believe that our colleagues ought to be reminded of exactly what it said. I am going to read it now: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, each State educational agency or local educational agency may establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and order applicable to all children within its jurisdiction to ensure safety and an appropriate educational atmosphere in its schools. 
That's all. That is the entire proposal. 
Well, when I made this proposal last year on my own, 47 Members of this body--just 3 short of the number needed to pass it--voted in favor of it. Several members who have voted against it have come to me since then to say that the combination of the reauthorization of IDEA, and the even more prescriptive regulations now proposed by the U.S. Department of Education, and the reactions of their own school boards, have caused them to rethink the issue. As a consequence, I believe that there is a very real chance that the Gorton-Gregg amendment would have been accepted by this body had we presented it. 
But I must say, in a very interesting side line, that it truly cross-pressured our school board members, our superintendents, our principals, our teachers, and our PTA members because, of course, by and large, they don't much like the Coverdell bill. They recognize that the Coverdell bill is very likely to pass, that it will be presented to the President and the President will veto it. So a combination of the proposition that the President would veto this amendment in 
connection with the veto of the Coverdell bill and their own opposition to Senator Coverdell has caused them to be less than enthusiastic about pursuing it at this time. 
That is a valid concern, Mr. President. Both Senator Gregg and I would like to accomplish our goal, would like to see to it that schools have restored to them the authority to keep order and to provide for the safety and security of their students. We feel this way in spite of the fact that we are strong supporters of the Coverdell bill. 
A second element is involved. The amendment can be read to cover two closely related, nonetheless distinct, subjects. One of those is the pure physical safety and security of students in schools; that is to say, allowing schools to take disciplinary measures even against those who are disabled. That will assure the safety and security of all of the rest of the students. That is what the editorial in the Seattle Post Intelligencer is about. 
But the other element in this amendment has to do with an appropriate educational atmosphere in the schools. That is even more worrisome to the community advocating the rights of the disabled. They see that as authorizing school boards, or teachers, or principals to expel students who present no safety hazard to their fellow students, but can be seen by the tremendous amount of attention they require on the part of teachers severely to distract from the educational atmosphere of a particular classroom. Personally, I believe that that is an appropriate consideration for our teachers and our principals and our school board members. I believe they have a right to weigh the quality of education of all of their students in making these judgments. I do recognize, however, that that aspect of this amendment is more controversial--not only more controversial, but more arguable than the balance is. And as a result of a series of meetings during the last two-week recess at schools all across the State of Washington, in which both the amendment I will introduce tomorrow on block grants and IDEA, aforementioned, more of our time was spent on this Disability Act and safety and security in the schools than on any other subject. 
At the last of those meetings when both the disability community was represented and school authorities were represented, I detected for the first time some willingness to meet on a middle ground. Whether that middle ground has to do with safety and security only, how far the disability community is willing to go in that connection, whether or not there ought to be some consideration of the educational atmosphere of all students, none of these questions were settled by any stretch of the imagination in the course of the meetings that I had, even with the education community in the State of Washington. But I do feel that it is at least possible that on this very controversial issue a bit more time may permit us to find some common ground. From my perspective at least, that is the second reason that it was appropriate that I consented to the withdrawal of the Gregg amendment at this point in the debate. 
I want to make it crystal clear, however, to educators all over the country who have supported us in this cause, that this withdrawal does not mean that the debate is over by any stretch of the imagination. The present Gregg-Gorton amendment, or something very similar to it, will be presented at an early opportunity on some other bill that relates directly or indirectly to education. It will not go away. But I hope the next time that it is presented, it is presented on a bill that is almost certain to be signed by the President of the United States rather than vetoed by the President of the United States. 
In addition, I hope that by that point we may have at least a partial meeting of the minds--one might hope a full meeting of the minds--between those genuinely concerned with the educational rights and civil rights of the disabled community and those genuinely concerned with the safety and security of all of our students, and on the proposition that all of our students receive their education in an atmosphere best conducive to that education for all students in the public schools of the United States. 
It is with those twin hopes--that we will have a better vehicle for this debate and that perhaps we can have the debate at a somewhat more extended fashion than the very limited time on the Coverdell bill and that we might bring the two sides together to a greater extent than they have ever been in the past--that I have agreed to the withdrawal of that amendment. 
It is withdrawn from this bill. It will come up again. I believe that we need to do more to empower those men and women all across the United States who provide the educational services to our children day after day, week after week, year after year because of their own professional dedication. I believe their views need to be considered, and I think that we will be able to consider them better a little later on this year. I pledge, however, that consider them we will.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, with the exception of the single paragraph toward the beginning of the eloquent statement by the Senator from Texas, I agree, literally, with every word of her remarks. In fact, I think, as I will show to you, that single paragraph with which I disagree is totally inconsistent with the remarks of the Senator from Texas. Let me tell you why. 
For my first 3 years in the U.S. Senate, 1981-1984, I held hearings, drafted, worked on, discussed, and ultimately sponsored and passed the Shipping Act of 1984. Fifteen years ago, I probably could have recited it from memory. I was at that time the chairman of the subcommittee of the Commerce Committee now chaired by my esteemed friend, the Senator from Texas. The goal of the Shipping Act of 1984 was to breathe fresh air, competition, and deregulation into the worldwide system of ocean carriage of goods, at least as that carriage affected the United States. It was an industry controlled by cartels and monopolies far less interested in those whom it served than in those who provided the service--most particularly, many foreign-flagged merchant marines. 
I am certain when I introduced that bill for debate I made the same remarks the Senator from Texas has just made--that it was not perfect, that it did not create a purely competitive market, but that it represented a major step forward in allowing the fresh air of competition to breathe on the ocean carriage of goods. And now building on that 1984 act, the Senator from Texas has brought us a further proposal which opens up, still wider, the field of ocean carriage of goods to competition. It is in that respect a fine bill. 
What the bill does is say that shippers can make agreements with ocean carriers in the same fashion that almost all contracts in the private sector can be made in the United States without having to follow the specific monetary requirements of filed tariffs, but simply as private contracts in which the shipper could get the best possible deal that it can negotiate and the carrier can get as high a price for that carriage as it can negotiate. This is the heart of the free market system. It is a precisely proper philosophy for the carriage of goods by sea. The bill also allows the ocean carriers to get together with land carriers so that you can get one price for shipping your goods from, say, in your case, Mr. President, Cheyenne, WY, to Yokohama, Japan, also a major step forward. 
One thing, however, it does not do, and that is what my amendment is all about. If you are a major manufacturer, a huge shipper, capable of filling an entire vessel with a single shipment of your goods, or at least so large a container that you can effectively deal directly with the ocean carrier, you get the advantage of this competitive system. You can make the best deal you can wring out of that ocean carrier. 
But if you are the kind of shipper or seller that I suspect is more common in a rural State like Wyoming, and you are shipping only a modest amount of goods, you have very little leverage with the ocean carrier. You probably don't even know very much about how to engage in that business. So you hire an intermediary, usually in one of America's ports, a customs broker, or a freight consolidator, to do it for you. These intermediaries, almost without exception, are small business people. That intermediary gets together a bunch of shipments from small shippers and it makes the contract with the ocean carrier. In other words, small business people hire other small business people to consolidate their shipments so they can have advantages equal to those of the big businesses and the big shippers. 
At the present time, under the 1984 law the same rules as to published tariffs and the degree of competition or lack of competition apply to the big shipper and the small shipper. 
And I may say that when the Senator from Texas wrote this bill, she provided the same advantages to the small shipper and the intermediary as she did to the big shipper. Obviously, there should not be discrimination between those two groups. And that is the way the bill was reported from the Commerce Committee--more competition, more ability to negotiate. You didn't have to tell your competitors what you were paying. Everybody benefited. 
Oh, but, Mr. President, what happen then? Well, then, the big longshore unions objected. The International Longshoremen's Association and the International Longshoremen's and Warehouseman's Union don't like these little guys because sometimes the little guys don't use the longshore unions to put these shipments together. So the longshoremen's unions go to the majority leader and the Senator from Texas and say: We are not going to let this bill pass unless you help us drive these little people out of business and say that we will give all of these new competitive advantages to the big boys, who automatically use the longshore unions, but we are not going to give the benefits of competition to the little people, to that small shipper from Cheyenne, WY; we are not going to give them to that freight intermediary in Seattle, WA, or in Newark, NJ. Oh, no. They still have to publish their rates. They still can't enter into long term contracts and make the best possible deal. 
So not only are you depriving the small shippers and transportation intermediaries of an advantage of a free market, you are telling them they are in a terribly unfavored competitive situation as against the ocean carriers themselves. You are forcing the small shipper in Cheyenne, if he can possibly do so, to go directly to the ocean carrier. 
What kind of deal do you expect he is going to get under those circumstances? He doesn't know anything about these transactions and he doesn't have any expert working for him. He will pay far more than his large competitor will for the carriage of his goods. Or, of course, he could still go to the intermediary, but the intermediary can't get as good a deal for him as the large shipper can get. 
You listened to the unanimous consent that preceded this debate, Mr. President, and you may have questioned the end of it. The end of it states that if I win, the ball game is over. If my amendment is adopted, most of the members of the party that claims to be for the little guy will kill the bill, and they will kill it because the little guy gets equal advantages with the big guy. That is what the unanimous consent is all about. 
Mr. President, it is no more complicated and no less complicated than just that. If we are willing to put our votes where our mouths are when we go home and talk about the virtues of small businesses, if we are willing to carry out the kind of pledges we make in our election campaigns and treat people equally, if we are willing to say that if a competitive market is good for the large, it is good for the small, we will vote for the Gorton amendment and see whether or not the people on the other side dare kill a procompetitive bill just because it doesn't add to the monopoly of two unions at the expense of small businesses all across the United States of America. 
Mr. President, I ask that you and other Members of this body consider this matter in the 2 1/2 weeks we are going to be away, and see whether or not we don't want to treat people fairly and not ratify an agreement that was made behind closed doors, with the ocean carriers present and the big shippers present and the unions present, but the small business people told: Get lost; we are not going to listen to you while we make this deal. 
That is the wrong way to reach an agreement, and it is the wrong way to pass legislation. We can correct it by passing this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Texas. We are about finished with debate on this amendment, and it is the appropriate course of action for both of us to yield back our time. I will maybe take 2 minutes on it and then relieve the Chair for my assignment there, and we can go on to something else. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the courteous response of the Senator from Texas to my remarks. Again I have to say that she and I agree profoundly on the goals of this legislation. I am proud that she has been able to build on what I started a decade and a half ago. She has worked as hard and almost as long on this bill as I did on the 1984 act itself. It certainly can be said they go in precisely the same direction--more competition, better service, and a higher degree of competitiveness on the part of American business in that portion of the world's merchant marine, including the U.S. flag merchant marine that operates out of the United States. She is certainly right when she says many of the current rules disadvantage American businesses and cause some shipments to go to Canada or Mexico that might otherwise come directly here. 
The amendment that I have proposed, of course, moves another major step in that direction. It is, as I emphasized, exactly what the Senator from Texas wanted when she wrote the bill in the committee and was forced to retreat from by these large interests, particularly the maritime unions. But it does disadvantage one group. If you have a semicompetitive system and all American businesses, large and small, operate under the same rules, that is one thing. If you have a system that says the big boys get to operate under much less restrictive rules, do not have to publish their fares and their tariffs, can enter into any kind of agreements they want, but the little guys cannot, they are still subject to those old rules, you have created a fundamentally unfair situation. When that unfairness is directed at small shippers and small freight consolidaters, the difference, the discrimination, is particularly egregious. 
I agree with the Senator from Texas. However it ends up, this is not the final form of the bill; it has not passed the House of Representatives yet. But, Mr. President, you and my colleagues should not fool yourselves to think if we do not adopt this fairness amendment, this small business amendment now, it is somehow going to come back in later. I think if we do adopt it now, we have a far greater opportunity to see to it that this bill is not only procompetition and deregulatory but fair; that all the people, all the groups in America who deserve that fairness, the small businesses, about whom we talk so much on every one of our trips home, do deserve an equal opportunity to compete. 
That is all this amendment is about. It allows the little guys to contract the way the big guys contract. Often we will make a policy that says the little people will have an advantage over the big ones because the big ones have the advantage of their 
bigness. Rarely do we say, as we are asked to here, that we will give the big guys an advantage and deprive their small competitors of that advantage. Equal the playing field. If competition is good for the large shippers, it is good for the small shippers. If it is good for the large carriers, it is good for the small carriers. That is what this amendment is all about. 
With that, I will yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. GORTON. I am concerned about one program which has been slated as an offset for transportation increases--the Market Access Program. The Market Access Program is a USDA cost-share program which provides assistance to U.S. agriculture when competing against subsidized nations overseas. 
In the State of Washington we have seen a dramatic increase in apple exports from 4.5 million boxes to over 25.1 million--an increase of over 500 percent. Export sales now total well over $300 million. This success is due, in part, to the Market Access Program. MAP is absolutely essential if U.S. agriculture is to remain viable and competitive in the international marketplace.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, six months ago, I came to the floor of the United States Senate to announce my reluctant support for removing one of two dams on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula. Today, after spending countless hours working with interested Washington State residents, I am introducing legislation to accomplish this difficult and costly endeavor provided certain conditions are met. 
As I mentioned in my statement last fall, I have never been enthusiastic about the idea of dam removal on the Elwha River as a means to enhance declining salmon runs on the river. For many years, national environmental groups, the Clinton Administration, much of the Northwest media, and many Northwest elected officials have pushed for removal of both dams from the Elwha River. In 1992, I supported legislation to begin the process of having the government acquire both of these dams with an eye toward removing them someday. While I have always been enthusiastic about the federal government buying these two dams from a local paper company, I continue to be skeptical toward claims that salmon runs will see a significant benefit through dam removal on the Elwha River. Anyone who believes otherwise needs to ask him why salmon runs on nearby rivers on the Olympic Peninsula with no dams are doing just as poorly. 
I am quite certain, however, that there are clear costs to dam removal. The taxpayers must pay at least $65 million to remove just one dam on the Elwha River. Power generation will be lost, and in the case of the Elwha River dams, serious questions remain about the potential damage to the City of Port Angeles' water supply. As I weigh these costs against the potential benefits to salmon, I have generally inclined against dam removal. 
Unfortunately, the issue isn't as simple as a cost-benefit analysis. There is a wild card over which I have no control that could have a devastating effect on the Port Angeles community. The lower Elwha River dam produces a tiny amount of power--only a quarter of the amount of power produced by the upper Elwha River dam and a minuscule amount in comparison to our productive Snake and Columbia River dams. In addition, the lower Elwha River dam is in poor physical condition. 
These two factors, combined with the desire of the Interior Secretary to tear down a dam, have me concerned that there is a very real and growing threat that a federal judge or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) could order removal of the Elwha River dams without Congressional approval. 
A court or agency ordered removal will impose all of the costs of removing the dams on the local community, jobs will be destroyed, and Port Angeles' supply of clean drinking water will be threatened. The risk of court or agency action is too great and will leave the local community in a terrible position if a judge, or a Washington, DC bureaucrat, suddenly decides he needs to be in charge of this issue. 
Instead, if Congress acts, we can remove the wild card and assure an important level of community protection. Thus, I have conditioned my support for this dam's removal on certain legislated protection for Port Angeles' water supply and protection for the jobs created by the local mill. No legislation to remove the dam will pass the U.S. Senate without these protections while I am a member. 
As a result of these recent developments and circumstances beyond my control, this comprehensive package will complete the federal government's acquisition of both Elwha River dams, authorizes removal of one dam, while at the same time protecting local economic interests. 
Over the last three years, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee that I chair has appropriated $11 million of the $29.5 million necessary to complete the acquisition of the projects. Acquisitions of the projects is extremely important to the future economic health of the Port Angeles community. While the James River Corporation currently holds title to the projects, Daishowa America, as local owner of the directory paper mill and second largest employer in Clallam County, uses energy from the dams. Clearly, continued uncertainty over the fate of these dams reduces the competitive position of the mill and inhibits future investment in the plant and its equipment. 
My bill amends the 1992 Act and calls for completion of acquisition of the projects. As Chairman of the Subcommittee that controls the purse strings for this project, I have every intention of allocating the remaining $18.5 million needed to complete acquisition as part of the $699 million worth of additional Land and Water Conservation Fund dollars that we appropriated last year and have yet to be spent. 
In addition to committing to fund the removal of the Elwha project should it become law, my bill prohibits the Secretary from removing the larger dam, better known as the Clines Canyon Project, for 12 years. Many have asked why we can't remove both dams simultaneously. My answer is that I prefer the phased approach to restoration of the river spelled out by the Elwha Citizens Advisory Committee in its 1996 report. 
The Committee, which is comprised of a diverse array of local interests, cautions against simultaneous removal of both dams. As an appropriations subcommittee chairman, I can tell them that they are absolutely correct because it is simply unrealistic to expect sufficient funds immediately to remove both projects. More importantly, immediate removal of both projects would have unpredictable consequences for the community's water supply--something my bill is careful to protect--and would needlessly forgo a valuable economic and recreational resource that can be put to use to accomplish restoration activities. 
When the 12 year moratorium has expired, my bill allows the Secretary to remove the upper dam provided he determines that the benefits of dam removal to salmon restoration and the natural state of the river outweighs the importance of the project's power generation capabilities and the recreational value of the lake that was created by its construction. The 12 year waiting period also spells out several important steps that the Secretary must take to evaluate the impact removing one dam has on fish runs. I firmly believe that should we decide one day to remove the second dam, we will do a far better job if we take the time to learn from the challenges of removing the first dam before deciding on the fate of the second one. Should the Secretary determine that it is necessary to remove the Glines Canyon project before 12 years have gone by, nothing in the bill I am offering today prevents him from seeking Congressional approval to do so. 
Finally with regard to the Elwha River, my bill takes several important steps to project the local community from the potentially adverse impacts of dam removal. They include: (1) protecting the quality and quantity of the community's existing water supply to meet current and future demands; (2) continued protection of James River and Daishowa from potential liability; and (3) compensation for Clallam County for further loss of tax revenue due to federal acquisition of the projects. 
As a Senator who takes pride in trying to represent all interests in my state, I have also taken great interest in the concerns of my constituents in eastern Washington, who while not directly impacted by the removal of the Elwha dam, have legitimate fears that something similar could happen to a dam on the Columbia or Snake Rivers. Clearly some groups and agency officials within the Clinton-Gore Administration want to use the removal of Elwha River dams as a first step toward removing or severely limiting the effectiveness of Columbia River system hydroelectric dams. Already, the Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating dam removal on the Snake River as a legitimate option. The Corps has even taken the unprecedented step of paying Pacific Northwest residents $12 to fill out a totally biased survey in favor of dam removal to build support for this cause. 
I will never support such efforts to cripple the world's most productive hydro system. As the source of the nation's lowest power rates, water for irrigating productive farmland in three states, and a cost effective transportation system that moves our agricultural products to market, these dams are truly the lifeblood of our economy in the Pacific Northwest. 
While Columbia River dams have hurt salmon runs, that damage was felt primarily in the 1930's and 1940's. Since the last Columbia River dam was constructed we still had large and healthy salmon runs. The last decade's decline in Columbia River salmon runs cannot be honestly attributed solely to our hydroelectric facilities. 
Nevertheless, we can and should do more for salmon especially by acting in a more coordinated way to restore this vital resource. But the costs associated with removing dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers will vastly exceed any potential benefit that might occur in terms of salmon restoration. 
Rather than working cooperatively with local communities directly impacted by the Columbia-Snake Resource on a rational policy that balances the rivers' important uses, the Clinton-Gore Administration has chosen a combative policy. Its approach punishes people who make their livelihoods from this resource and who have made good faith efforts to reach out and work together. 
Another example of the draconian actions federal agencies are using against ordinary people who depend on the Columbia Snake River System for their livelihoods is the National Marine Fisheries Service's recently announced Columbia Basin water policy. The NMFS approach seeks to discourage or even eliminate any new additional water withdrawals for municipal, industrial, or irrigation development within the Basin. The NMFS policy goes even further in challenging the legislative authority of states to regulate, manage, and allocate water rights. If adopted, the NMFS policy would effectively abrogate state authority to grant future water rights for such uses. By calling for a review of existing water withdrawals, the policy postures toward challenging existing state-granted water rights. The agency has completely ignored the efforts of local irrigators to work together on a plan that balances the rivers' competing uses. Moreover, the agency has taken this direction without Congressional approval. 
Given the out-of-control nature of agencies like the Corps and NMFS to go beyond their statutory authority to severely compromise the Columbia-Snake system as well as their eagerness to tear down a Columbia-Snake River dam, I would not be surprised to see this administration try to fulfill its dream without Congressional approval. 
The people of my state are simply fed up with this top down approach and my bill attempts to do something about it. In addition to prohibiting the removal or breach of any dam on the Columbia or Snake Rivers, my bill prohibits any federal or state agency from taking the following actions without an act of Congress:

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the two judicial nominees from Washington state. The federal bench will be enriched by the addition of Margaret McKeown to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, as it will by Edward Shea's presence on federal district court for the Eastern District of Washington. 
Both Margaret McKeown and Edward Shea are deservedly respected within the legal community and in the community at large, and well qualified to perform the important jobs for which they have been chosen. 
Ed Shea has been in private practice in Pasco, Washington for many years. He has handled a wide range of cases, both civil and criminal, and his experience will have prepared him well for the job he's about to undertake. As testament to the respect he commands within the Washington legal community, Ed served as President of the Washington State Bar Association in 1996. Equally impressive as his commitment to his profession is his commitment to his community. Over the years, he has contributed his time and talent to a host of worthy causes, including the March of Dimes, the Tri-Cities Sexual Assault Response Center, and the Association of Retarded Citizens. 
Margaret McKeown also comes to the bench from private practice. She is a high technology litigator of national repute, with a particular expertise in antitrust and intellectual property. She was also the first woman partner at the prestigious Seattle law firm, Perkins Coie, where she practices today. Her remarkable intellect, and the accomplishments that evidence speak to her ability to perform the job with which she has been entrusted. There is no question that Margaret McKeown is familiar with the law. But, as her statement to the graduating class of the University of Washington Law School last year reflects, in this case familiarity did not breed contempt. Her mastery and understanding of the legal process rang through her commencement address. As did her continued respect for the law. She also urged the new lawyers to bear in mind her own formula for survival, a formula composed of five elements: humor, humility, hubris, humanity and home. The formula is one that has made Margaret an excellent lawyer. I am confident it will make her an excellent judge. 
I thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting both of these nominees. And I congratulate them again.

Mr. GORTON. Earlier this afternoon, I introduced an amendment which would have instructed the U.S. representative to the International Monetary Fund to vote against any proposal with respect to Indonesia that would have benefited President Soeharto or his family or his close associates. 
I did so because it seemed to me that while several of the Nations in Southeast Asia that have been subjected to these runs on their currency and toward the present economic crisis were close friends of the United States, had developed democratic institutions like our own, were struggling toward free markets like our own, this was not taking place in Indonesia. It was a wholly-owned family subsidiary benefiting largely the Soeharto family and not the people of Indonesia. 
I pointed out that it seemed to me unfair to impose heavy requirements on friends of ours like the Republic of Korea and the Philippine Republic and allow any IMF money to go to Indonesia that was resisting all of the attempts by IMF to reform its economy. 
Others, including the Treasury, the distinguished chairman of the committee, and many others who have been interested in the International Monetary Fund asked me to modify my amendment. I have done so, to make it more narrow with respect to aid to the Soeharto family, narrow enough so I must say, I think it is symbolic only, but to require the United States not to favor any proposition with respect to Indonesia that is less stringent than those that the IMF is imposing on the Republic of Korea and the Philippine Republic, two of the closest allies and best friends with the longest association with the United States of any of the countries of Southeast Asia. 
With that motion, I understand the amendment is acceptable 
and will be adopted by a voice vote. But I do want to say that I know that I represent a strong strain of opinion in this Senate that we should not be bailing out the Soeharto family, even indirectly, through our contributions to the International Monetary Fund. 
I want the message to be heard loud and clear in Jakarta that true reforms to its economy are absolutely essential, that the International Monetary Fund and the United States are simply not interested in bailing out a family enterprise--fortunes stolen through corruption and inside dealing in the way that has been all too true in Indonesia over the course of the past decades--that there is a difference among the countries seeking aid in Southeast Asia from the International Monetary Fund. I am told that in some respects the requirements being imposed on Indonesia are tougher than those on South Korea and the Philippine Republic. If so, that is fine. But I certainly don't want us favoring Indonesia over those two nations that have been our allies for such an extended period of time. 
So even if this amendment is only symbolic at this point--and it may very well be--I think the symbolism is important. I think that symbolism is vitally important. 
I believe as a general proposition that it is in the interests of the United States to help the International Monetary Fund help countries that are willing to try to help themselves out of a severe economic crisis, even selfishly from the point of view of our own economy and our own exporters who are already seeing, in increasing trade deficits, the adverse impacts on trade in the crisis in Southeast Asia. 
Certain IMF assistance is in the interest of the United States. Bailing out the Soeharto family is not, and that is what this amendment is designed to accomplish.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak to you and my colleagues here today as a supporter of the International Monetary Fund. I believe that the crisis in Southeast Asia is one that is important to the economy of the United States, and that those nations in Southeast Asia that are in great financial difficulty can be helped to work their own way out of these economic difficulties by the kind of prescriptions to which the International Monetary Fund has subjected them. One of those nations, South Korea, is bound to us by the close-as-possible ties of blood and sentiment over almost half a century and, reflecting the views of the people of the United States, has become a free market and a democracy. 
Another of those nations, the Philippine Republic, has been tied to us for a full century and has struggled in the direction of free markets and of a democracy during that period of time. Today, it is a rather considerable success at both. 
Thailand and Malaysia are trying, with great difficulty, to meet the financial challenges with which they have been faced. 
One nation, however, does not fall into any of these categories. In Indonesia, President Soeharto is a wholly owned family enterprise. Its economy--behind those of all the other nations in Southeast Asia, from the point of view of the degree to which its benefits have been distributed among its people--is corrupt, undemocratic, and designed to primarily, it seems, at least through its economy, to benefit the immediate family and the close friends and henchmen of the now seven-term President of Indonesia, Mr. Soeharto. Indonesia has resisted, at every turn, the prescriptions that the International Monetary Fund has laid down for the recovery of its economy. As a consequence, I believe, and I believe firmly, that we in the United States should not bow to the will of this dictator, should not say that requirements that are being imposed on other nations that are trying, with great difficulties, to work their way out, with democratic institutions in place in those countries, should not be imposed on Indonesia. 
This amendment is quite simple. It doesn't attempt to dictate to the International Monetary Fund what it does, but it does direct our Secretary of the Treasury to instruct our representative on the International Monetary Fund to use the voice and vote of the United States to prevent the extension by the International Monetary Fund of loans or credits that would personally benefit the President of Indonesia or any member of the President's family or benefit any financial institution or commercial enterprise in which the President of Indonesia or any member of the President's family has a financial interest. 
Now, I understand, curiously enough, that there are those who object to this amendment on the grounds that that covers everything in Indonesia, that every institution that would be helped is owned, in whole or in part, by the President or by members of his family. In my view, that is the best possible argument in favor of this amendment. We have a financial structure in that country that has been built up to benefit the family of the President and his close associates, and only them. While my heart goes out to the people of Indonesia, I believe that if there is to be any International Monetary Fund aid to Indonesia with the consent and help of the United States, it should be to the people and not to the family of the President. 
Essentially, Mr. President, that is what this amendment says--neither more nor less. We should not use our credits in the International Monetary Fund, with our vote, to bail out a President whose sole interest seems to be in the aggrandizement of his own family, who is indifferent to the requirements that the International Monetary Fund has laid out to them, who has caused the crisis in his country to become much worse, sharply worse, as a result of his inaction than it would have been had he followed the requirements of the IMF some time ago. We should not lend ourselves to his intransigence in any respect whatsoever, Mr. President. As a consequence, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. I will reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, half a century ago this year there were giants in the land. President Truman, followed by President Eisenhower, Senator Vandenberg in this body, others who first envisaged and passed the Marshall plan to secure economic freedom and prosperity in Western Europe and then to create the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to provide physical security behind which the nations of Western Europe could build free and prosperous societies. Those giants were followed by dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Members of this body who kept the faith--my predecessor, Scoop Jackson, from the State of Washington; Presidents down through and including Ronald Reagan and George Bush. And I come to the floor today astounded at opposition to this extension and to any other extension to free nations, so astounded that by comparison with those giants, I am reminded of Casius' description of Julius Caesar in Shakespeare's great play, when we are asked to live up to his description of: 
. . . we petty men 
Walk under his huge legs and peep about 
To find ourselves dishonorable graves. 
Because of the vision of those men and those women and, for that matter, of the United States of America and our allies in Western Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization became the most successful single defense organization, security organization, in the history of the world. Its ultimate dreams came true both earlier and more completely than any of its founders could possibly have imagined when they put it together and brought the American people into it. 
It was a treaty that joined together not just allies in World War II, but joined those allies together with their principal enemies in World War II, Germany and Italy, in the feeling that if they were together, the kind of breakdown that took place in the years leading up to 1914 and, again, up to 1939 would be much less likely to take place. 
During that entire period of time, there was a line, a north-south line, through Central Europe: oppression and dictatorship and economic stagnation to the east; freedom, security and prosperity to the west. Not once in its most powerful days did the Soviet Union ever cross that line and not at all, incidentally--not once--during all those years did the Western powers with their military force cross that line to the east. It was a shield, a carapace behind which freedom could develop. 
But the dream of that freedom was not limited to those within the organization to the west of that line. It activated, it inspired men and women east of the line to be like the people of the West, to join the people of the West, tremendously costly to many of them. 
When the people of Hungary attempted to liberate themselves from that Soviet tyranny, they were brutally repressed by Soviet tanks. When the people of the Czech Republic, in the beginning of those years, attempted even a modest measure of freedom, they were repressed by Soviet tanks, and those tanks spent the better part of half a century in Poland absolutely to ensure that the liberty-loving people of Poland were not able to exercise that liberty or to have a government that was truly their own. 
Then wonder of wonders, in a very few short years, symbolized a little less than a decade ago by the destruction of the Berlin Wall, those nations and others became free nations. They began to realize their aspirations, and in the case of those three, each one, in a short period of time of less than a decade, has become a functioning democracy, has made a major beginning in reforming its armed services, has moved decisively in the direction of free markets and has begun the long, long journey to catch up with the West economically, but catch up with the West in spirit it has. 
What do those nations desire? They desire the security that history has never given them, that their own independent power has never given them. They desire to be a part of the West, lock, stock and barrel, and they see the essential element of being western to be members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They know, they have learned from history, that that membership, and that membership alone, will ensure that they can continue the freedom which is still so young in them and continue the move toward prosperity and toward Western institutions, and that we, who not only spent trillions of dollars in preserving the free world through our armed services, but hundreds of millions, billions of dollars in broadcasting to these countries the message of freedom and the, at least implicit and I think often explicit, promise that the day would 
come when they could be lock, stock and barrel a part of the West, are now asked by, hopefully, not much more than a handful of the Members in this body, to reject them, to say that somehow or another, there will be more security in a vacuum in Eastern and Central Europe than there will be with the very kind of precise line that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization drew so decisively and so successfully half a century ago. 
But nothing, Mr. President, nothing in the history of nations in this world indicates that a vacuum filled by small and weak powers can possibly be stable, can possibly be the object of anything other than irredentist aspirations on the part of one of the two nations that throughout its history has been the most aggressive in destroying the freedom of those countries. 
Germany, now totally integrated into the West, no longer a threat, but no longer a threat to France because they are joined together, and is soon to be no longer a threat to Poland or to Hungary or to the Czech Republic, because they will be joined together. 
The case for NATO expansion is simply overwhelming. It is stunning to me that we are so much as debating its desirability in this body and stunning to me that essentially the only reason for opposition to it is that the most truculent element left in Russia, its Duma, dominated by former Communists, those portions of its leadership that are most unwilling to give up what they have had previously, most desirous to restore the status quo ante-1989, will be offended if these countries are brought into alliance with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Mr. President, that is the best reason to join those countries with us. Far better to do it when there is no immediate threat from the East than when there is, when, I can assure you, the kind of opposition you have heard here today would be much louder than it is today. 
I think it is appropriate to go beyond the naming of these three nations. One of the most principled actions in American diplomatic history, in my view, was the absolute refusal for more than half a century on the part of the United States to recognize the Soviet conquest of the three Baltic republics. We, and almost we alone, continued to recognize their right to independence, and one can certainly make the proposition that it was the desire and the movement for independence in those three countries that was the immediate and proximate cause of the collapse of the Soviet Union itself. 
I believe, Mr. President--I believe firmly--that any nation that adopts secure and democratic institutions, a free-market approach to its economy and a Western-oriented means of defense, has the right seriously to be considered in this part of Europe for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Personally, I believe that both Slovenia and Estonia have already met those qualifications. Other nations have not yet, though most of them strive in that direction. 
Again, to crush their aspirations, legitimate aspirations, aspirations that we have supported for more than half a century, by an arbitrary statement that they will not be considered for membership for a fixed period of time, no matter how successful they are, no matter how democratic they are, no matter how much they may be threatened by some future Russia in that period of time, is perverse and wrong and, even more significant, dangerous to the peace of Europe and to the peace of the world. 
A bright line is a much greater contributor to peace than a vague set of feelings or concerns or worries about the least regressive elements in Russian society. Just as a democratic and a free-market Germany appropriately became a pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, so at some future date could a secure and stable and democratic and free-market Russia. 
I think that day is a long way off, much farther than I would like. But until that day, to say that others who have met those qualifications, who have had to live through occupation and repression from that country, should be left on their own flies in the face of all of the lessons of history that we have learned since the end of World War II. 
So, Mr. President, I believe that we should reject soundly the Warner-Moynihan pause proposal and enthusiastically and overwhelmingly adopt the resolution of ratification that we have before us. 
The cold war resulted in a victory for the ideals of the United States and its Western allies. And it should be consolidated by joining with it those who share those ideals, those who fought for those ideals, often to their very great detriment over the course of the last century. 
The position taken by my distinguished friend from Delaware is totally and entirely correct. I congratulate him for it. I am convinced that we should go forward boldly into the future with the greatest degree of confidence in the correctness of our cause and only in that fashion will we be worthy of our predecessors in this body who created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, these remarks are the second in a series that I call `The Corps of Engineers Sweepstakes.' Two or 3 weeks ago I was on the floor to speak about a series of foot-dragging and irrational decisions on the part of the Corps of Engineers in an area that affects not only your State and mine, including its proposal to bury an archeological site on which a 9,000-year-old human skeleton had been found. Because of the wishy-washy answers on that subject from the corps, there is now included in the supplemental appropriations bill about to be discussed on this floor a prohibition against the corps destroying that archeological site. 
But the corps is at it again, another installment in the comedy of errors. The bureaucrats in the Army Corps of Engineers office in Walla Walla, WA, have taken it upon themselves to promote and publish a survey of public opinion on the removal of four dams on the lower Snake River. The corps right now, today, is in the process of distributing this survey to some 12,000 people. Sending out a survey to 12,000 people to determine what they think about removing dams is one thing. But if you are the winner in this sweepstakes and get one of the surveys in the mail, out of the envelope drops a $2 bill. The corps is using $24,000 in taxpayers' money just to put $2 bills in the envelope that contains the survey. 
But that is not all. You get $2 for being the passive recipient of the survey. If you fill it out and send it back to the Corps of Engineers, they will send you another $10. That is much better than the odds in any of the multitude of sweepstakes we receive that say you may be a winner if you send it in, with odds of 100 billion to 1. Everybody gets the $2, and everybody who sends the survey in gets the additional $10. If they all answer, that is $144,000 of the taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, both you and I are constantly on the backs of the corps to engage in constructive projects that really mean something for us. I am sure you have received the same reaction that I have, on a number of occasions, that `We just don't have enough money to do that. You are going to have to appropriate more.' Here is $144,000, plus the cost of the survey, designing it and totaling it up. That simply is a waste of money. Am I to believe that the Corps of Engineers is truly broke when it is littering mailboxes in my State with $2 bills and promises of more? Last night, when I was discussing this with a friend, he laughed and said that he had recently gotten a survey from Lexus about luxury automobiles. In dealing with automobiles that cost more than $35,000, Lexus promised that if you sent in the survey they would send you $1. Luxury automobiles, $1 per survey; the Corps of Engineers on removing dams, $12 per survey. This is just not the way in which to spend taxpayer money. This is not going to increase confidence in the way that our Government spends our money. 
This is such a totally outrageous use of the taxpayers' money that I cannot resist the temptation to make more than one set of remarks on the floor on the subject, so I can promise you, Mr. President, that I will be back next week to tell you what is in the survey. If you are shocked about free $2 bills and free $10 bills from your friendly neighborhood Corps of Engineers office, wait until you, as a Senator from Oregon, see the totally distorted way in which the corps seeks your views, completely stacked toward one set of answers to the questions rather than an objective survey. But that is for another time. 
For this morning, the sole remark is: Here is this Government agency, constantly crying poverty to us when we have constructive activities for it to engage in, dropping $2 bills in mailboxes across southeastern Washington, and maybe a part of Oregon, for all I know, and promising $10 more for 5 minutes' worth of work in filling out a phony survey. 
This is not the way we should be spending our taxpayers' money.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year the Senate approved the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. I was the only Member to vote against this bill, not because I disagree with the premise of IDEA to ensure that children with special needs receive an education, but because its focus is so narrow it avoids entirely or interferes with the overall quality of education provided to all of our young people. This narrow focus also abrogates the rights of those who are closest to our children--their parents, teachers, school administrators and their elected school board members--to make judgments about how to provide the best possible education for the largest number of students. 
The new law, like the previous statute, proposes a series of largely unfunded mandates on every school district in the Nation. What Congress did was to say to each school district: We know what is best for you. We are going to tell you what to do and how to do it, but we won't pay the costs associated with our decisions. 
I was so frustrated by this attitude that Washington, DC, knows best, that last year I offered two amendments, one on school safety and the other on school funding. 
The two amendments were based on the same philosophy: Education policies are best determined by those closest to our children--their parents, teachers, principals and school boards. Their ability to teach kids and to create safe and conducive learning environments shouldn't be stifled by mandates from Congress or overregulation by the Department of Education. 
While the school safety amendment was narrowly defeated by only three votes, the Senate approved my amendment to send K through 12 funding directly to local school districts. In addition to giving local educators the authority to spend education funds on their priorities in their school districts, the amendment repealed hundreds of pages of regulations handed down by the Department of Education, placing the focus on teaching kids and not on endless paperwork. There is clearly significant support in the Senate for giving control of the schools back to parents, teachers, and locally elected school board members. 
Unfortunately, if the proposed regulations for the new IDEA are any indication, it seems that the Department of Education didn't get that message. Instead of reducing regulations, it has increased them. Instead of simply providing an interpretation of the new law, the Department ignores congressional intent and creates its own policies. The new regulations are more than 25,000 words longer than the old ones--a 71 percent increase in words about which to argue, litigate, and otherwise divert resources from educating kids. 
Instead, our teachers and principals will be saddled with the implementation of a more complex set of federally imposed requirements, some created by the Federal bureaucracy and never voted on by any Member of Congress. One special ed director told me, `At least monthly, one of my staff tells me he or she is leaving special ed because of the paperwork.' And another superintendent echoed that frustration when he wrote that, `A process which is supposed to result in an education program . . . becomes a battleground on which procedures become more important than educational results.' 
One district sent me the paperwork required just to start a child on special education programs. It is close to 40 feet long with one form pasted on to another. It is no wonder our educators are frustrated. I'm afraid that the new law, and most certainly the new regulations will not allow educators to focus on kids. Instead, they will have to focus on process and on ensuring that their district complies with myriad complex rules and procedures. 
Special ed teachers will continue to leave their profession in frustration; school districts will spend money on ensuring that `I's' are dotted and `T's' crossed to avoid litigation and kids won't receive the education they might otherwise receive in the absence of the regulations handed down by Washington DC bureaucrats. 
The 1997 amendments were developed in an unusual process in which the Department of Education had a seat at the table while the new law was being crafted. The Department knew where compromises were made, where Congress chose to act and where Congress intentionally remained silent. It is troubling, although perhaps not entirely unexpected, given the Department's past history, that the regulations seem to have turned into a vehicle for the Department to enact policies that it supports but that Congress specifically rejected. The proposed regulations include notes and previous policy letters, which instead of providing clarification, create new interpretations of the law. The Department of Education has also used these regulations to promote a particular approach to the provision of local services and to influence specific local educational decision making. These expansions beyond the Act not only continue the traditional federal overregulation in special education but also exceed the mission of the federal Department of Education in promoting or favoring a particular educational approach. All of this invites more litigation and less flexibility. 
The message these regulations send to each and every teacher and principal is that Washington DC doesn't trust you to do your job with care and compassion. Bureaucrats at the Department of Education are the best judge of what is necessary and appropriate at the local level and that uniform solutions can be applied to every situation. Who is more qualified to help our special needs students? Someone who dedicates each day to helping children learn? Or a faceless bureaucrat sitting behind a desk in Washington DC? Within the 110 pages of regulatory pronouncements there are literally hundreds of provisions of concern to the school districts in Washington state. There are simply too many to cover in the time I have on the floor, so I will focus on only a few issues. 
There is no other issue in IDEA as contentious as discipline procedures and there is no other area in regulation where the Department takes more liberty to act in defiance of Congressional intent. While I did not support the final provisions on discipline, they were the result of careful compromises on all sides--compromises in which the Department of Education was involved. Instead of honoring those agreements, the Department decided to legislate on its own. 
The Department decided that a child should be in an alternative education setting for no more than 10 school days in each school year. Congress based the length of a student's suspension on Honig v. Doe which allows a child to be placed in an alternative education setting or suspension for not more than 10 school days. Honig and thus the statute simply says 10 school days nothing more, nothing less. By overstepping its regulatory authority, the Department's proposal means that a young person with a few infractions during the school year such as smoking, cutting class, bad language and the like, could by the end of the school year commit the same minor infractions and be subject to no significant discipline or a very different one than his or her peers; and his or her peers would still be subject to the general rules established by the principal or school district. In effect we are telling these children, one set of rules applies to most kids and a very different, and much more lax set of rules applies to you. 
Once a child's disciplinary action exceeds the cumulative 10 days in a school year, the Department's regulations trigger a new array of requirements. Just a few disciplinary infractions within the 10 month school year could mean that a number of new, costly service and procedural requirements, including full educational services during suspension, IEP meetings, and assessment plans. The regulations also infer that a manifestation determination must be held for each infraction of school rules if the child has already exceeded this 10 school day limit--even if the misbehavior is relatively minor and would only result in a disciplinary action of one or two days. Schools would be forced to decide whether or not to pay for the costs of the manifestation determination or simply letting the behavior slide. This again has no legislative basis and will be especially burdensome for small school districts and those in rural areas that can't afford to keep specialists on staff in the event they might be needed. 
Additional proposed regulations, without legislative sanction, include the requirement of a decision within 10 days of the request for an expedited hearing. The Department also specifically discourages home bound placement except for medically fragile children, ignoring that under certain circumstances for safety, home bound instruction may be appropriate. Another note encourages returning a child who has been placed in an alternative placement for 45 days back to the classroom once behavior interventions are in place. It should be remembered, 
however, that the child was removed from his or her regular classroom because of dangerous behavior, either a weapons or drug violation, not simply the need to develop new remedies. 
Both the law and the regulations set an almost impossible standard for schools to meet in establishing requirements for this alternative educational placement. This placement must include services or modifications to address the original misbehavior so that it does not recur and the school must anticipate and provide modifications for any other behavior that would result in the child being removed from the regular education placement for more than 10 school days. One small school district with only 250 K-12 students had a student with a disability grab another student, put a saw to his neck and threaten to cut it off. Was the school district responsible for anticipating and preventing the outburst? The new regulations seem to imply that it would be. 
Additionally, nondisabled children can circumvent school disciplinary action by claiming a disability. A child or parent can come along after the fact and claim that the misbehavior was caused by a previously undiagnosed disability. Both the law and proposed regulations are so loosely structured that almost any noneligible child with a behavior problem can assert IDEA protections. 
What do all of these regulations mean for the classroom teacher and the children in our schools? One principal tells me that special education students brag to other students that the consequences of misbehavior do not apply to them. This will certainly continue to be the case under the new law and the regulations. In another small town in my state, one high school student with a learning disability brought a handgun into class. The gun discharged and a bullet passed through the leg of another student. After a review team determined the misconduct was not the result of the student's disabling condition, a one-year expulsion from school was initiated. The parents appealed, alleging the student's IDEA rights had been violated. The hearing officer ordered the continuation of educational services for the special education portion of the day. A tutorial program, off campus, was established to continue the child's special education services at substantial cost to the District. The new requirement to provide the full educational program would increase this cost four fold. Should the educational opportunities for other students be negatively impacted by redirecting $60,000 from other classrooms to pay for a tutorial program for a student who's behavior is not caused by their disability and who shoots another in class? If any of us here on the Senate floor were in the classroom and we were faced with a violent or disruptive child, how would we handle the situation? Would we rely on our years of classroom experience, or would we rely on a set of rules and regulations from Washington DC to guide us? Unfortunately, for every child and teacher in our country, the Department's proposed regulations result in an even more inflexible dual standard of discipline for students with disabilities, a standard that further sets them apart from other students and relieves them from responsibility for their own acts 
Because of its complexity and the provisions that make attorneys' fees a one way street for parents, IDEA is one of the most litigated of all federal statutes. Forbes magazine recently described it this way, `Special ed has become the ambulance and lawyers are chasing it.' Instead of ensuring that dollars stay focused on the classroom, the Department appears to encourage parents, through the policies it has developed in these regulations, to sue their school districts. Congress encouraged mediation, yet the department provides no regulatory `guidance' on mediation and in fact makes it easier for parents to get their lawyers fees paid for by encouraging states to enact laws allowing hearing officers to award attorneys' fees. The Department gives states new authority to order compensatory services and eliminates the administrative appellate option of Secretary-level federal review from current regulations. All of these changes are without legislative foundation. Again, little to no consideration has been given to the impact these regulations and the enormous costs that will most certainly accompany them will have on the education of all children in the school district. 
Overwhelmingly each school district I have heard from is concerned about the implementation date. Under the proposed regulations Individual Educational Plans for every child must comply with the new law and new requirements by July 1, 1998. Since most IEPs are reviewed on an annual basis, IEPs developed for a full year of services would be invalidated. School districts will have virtually no time between issuance of the final regulations and the July 1 implementation date to involve regular education teachers and to consider the many new IEP factors. For school districts with thousands of IEPs the tasks of revising each IEP according to the final regulations will be impossible by July 1, 1998. The imposition of a July 1 implementation date for all IEPs places all school districts in a position of massive potential financial liability. Administrative and judicial complaints concerning any service contained in a non-complying IEP that was developed to meet the requirements of the new regulations will likely result in major financial judgments against the nation's schools. 
This is by no means an exhaustive list of Washington state concerns. There are many other areas where the Department defies Congressional intent such as, the promotion of extended year services, or the Department's unilateral expansion of the definition of related services to include travel training, nutrition services and independent living. There are just simply too many to mention all of them here. The few I have mentioned are merely examples of the attitude that is pervasive at the Department of Education--we know better than local parents, teachers, principals and elected school board members. In most organizations the philosophies of its leader sets the standard for its employees. The Department of Education is no exception. In last year's state of education address, Secretary Riley speaking about national testing said that we should not `cloud our childrens' future with silly arguments about federal government intrusion'. I can guarantee you, that to the thousands of schools that must comply with the rules, regulations, paperwork and direction from Washington DC laid down by these regulations the argument about federal government intrusion is far from silly. 
To add insult to injury, the administration apparently believes that school districts coffers are brimming with cash to implement the new regulations and absorb the associated costs. Clearly, no thought has been given to the impact on the education of the children in the school district or to minimizing the growing adversarial relationship between special education and regular education. The Department's regulations certainly demonstrate that indifference, but the President's budget request may be the most telling. This year, if the President has his way, the per child federal contribution for special education will actually go down. Further, the administration acknowledges that its proposed funded level represents a federal contribution of merely 9 percent of the excess costs of educating kids under IDEA. If the Administration wants to tell local schools how to run their special ed programs, the President and his Administration should have the common decency to adequately fund those demands. 
Contrary to what the Department of Education seems to believe, the 1997 Amendments to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act were not a vehicle for empowering the federal bureaucracy to enact its own laws. I'd like to take this opportunity to remind the Department of a law Congress passed in 1996, the Small Business Growth and Fairness Act, which includes a provision giving Congress the authority to review and disprove each and every new regulation promulgated by the federal agencies. 
I am told that the Secretary is working with the committees of jurisdiction regarding the proposed regulations and I hope that process results in substantial improvement. Otherwise, I'm afraid the final regulations will be so onerous that Congress will have no choice but to ask the Department to start over again. 
Mr. President, I simply state that the law itself was detailed enough and bad enough in its centralization. The regulations are considerably worse. Once again, Mr. President, I could roll this out here on the floor. This is the set of forms required of a school district for a single disabled student. It is close to 40 feet in length. This is what we have done to our schoolchildren, to our teachers, and to our school districts. It's wrong. We aren't paying for it and we have to reform here, not in the school districts.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States relevant to this discussion reads `nor shall any State deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.' 
There was over an extended period of time a debate in the Supreme Court as to whether or not that equal protection clause, applicable by its terms only to States, applied as well to the Federal Government. The Supreme Court has decided that question essentially in the affirmative simply by stating that the fifth amendment to the Constitution, through its due process clause, incorporates the philosophy identical to the equal protection clause in the 14th amendment. 
The next debate is over whether or not a nonmember of a minority has the ability to claim discrimination by reason of a provision like the one that is at issue here today. The Supreme Court in the Adarand case, a case already discussed at length during the course of this debate, says, `The principle of consistency simply means that whenever the Government treats any person unequally because of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and the spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.' 
Finally, with respect to this provision here, the Court in that case said, `It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on race, a group classification, long recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited, should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the personal right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. A free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality should tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons. Accordingly, we hold today that all racial classifications imposed by whatever Federal, State, or local governmental action must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling government interests.' 
As against that, what do we have here? The heart of the amendment proposed by the Senator from Kentucky strikes a section identical to the present law that says, `Except to the extent that the Secretary determines, otherwise not less than 10 percent of the amounts made available for any program under titles I and II of this Act shall be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.' 
The dual statutory definition of `disadvantaged' deals with sex and with racial minorities. 
Mr. President, I do not see that it can seriously be maintained that a national quota stating `no less than 10 percent' can possibly be justified under that Supreme Court language granting neutral equal protection of the laws of the United States to every single individual. 
Clearly, the Supreme Court allowed a case-by-case evaluation of disfavored classes, mostly racial minorities, to determine whether or not they had suffered discrimination and, therefore, required specific aid in order to catch up and to be put on an equal plane. But nothing in the portion of this bill which the McConnell amendment would strike speaks to that kind of consideration. It simply says that all of those not defined as disadvantaged in our society are absolutely barred and prohibited from getting certain governmental contracts. 
Once again, I read from the Supreme Court decision. `A free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality should tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons.' 
Not only are there no compelling reasons in this section of this bill, there are no reasons at all. Simply 10 percent of contracts are barred from being awarded to any person outside this disfavored class. 
Is it any wonder that the district court on remand summarily entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in that case? Of course. There is no possible way of finding this statute to be constitutional. 
That district court opinion is now on appeal in the 10th circuit, I understand. It is possible that the ensuing decision may again be appealed to the Supreme Court. I would give 20-to-1 odds that the Supreme Court will simply deny certiorari since the conclusion is so obvious. 
This does not mean that the sponsors of this bill could not have written in this bill a narrowly tailored specific set of preferences for people against whom specific discriminatory actions had been taken, tailoring it to meet the very requirements of the Constitution laid down by the Supreme Court in a decision, the result of which, it seems to me, was obvious. 
But, Mr. President, the sponsors of this bill did not do that. Whatever excuse the authors of the previous proposal 5 years ago may have had, the authors of this bill had none. They know what is required in order to discriminate. 
They ignored the views of the Supreme Court. And they say, we don't care, we are going to continue this flat quota. This is not the affirmative action about which we have been having a legitimate debate over whether or not there ought to be certain forms of assistance provided to disadvantaged people. This is a debate about the most explicit quota one can possibly imagine and it is simply irresponsible for us to continue. 
If the sponsors of the bill do not like the specific proposal that is substituted for this quota, proposed by Senator McConnell, fine. Let them come up with one that meets constitutional muster. I think they can. It is just that they have simply not done so to this point.

Mr. GORTON. This illustrates what happened in the real world. It includes a half dozen responses to this small business company with respect to contract submissions in which it was the low bidder, in which the general contractor says, we would like to have picked you, we would have saved money for the taxpayers had we picked you, but we cannot pick you because of absolute orders from the Department of Transportation because of a quota system. 
Ironically, the winning high bidders in several of these contracts are larger business enterprises than is Frank Gurney, Inc., with a longer history. The net result is fewer roads are built and improved in order to provide contracts for people less disadvantaged than the low bidder. That is the real world impact of what we have done here. 
The Senator from Kentucky knows that we have certain disagreements over what the affirmative language in his amendment should have included. I would have done it somewhat differently. But I am here because I believe that the fundamental approach he has taken to strike an express percentage racial quota is not only the only appropriate response under the Constitution but is the only appropriate, just response in a society based on the proposition that people deserve equal treatment and only equal treatment. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that this is an open-and-shut case. We should repeal the sections to be stricken here. If a majority of this body believes in a form of affirmative action, then it should devise a form of affirmative action that meets the strict-scrutiny standards set down by the Supreme Court and does not include a quota system that is entirely unrelated to whether or not its beneficiaries have ever suffered any discrimination whatsoever.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week, when I was first informed of the proposal by the Senator from New Jersey, I was torn. I agreed totally with his philosophy, but I also have a great deal of respect for the States and for their legislatures that, of course, have full jurisdiction over this problem. Many States have acted, and other States are in the process of acting. 
Over the weekend, however, I ceased to be pulled in two separate directions on this subject by a remarkable article directly on point in the Sunday Seattle Times. 
I would like to share with my colleagues some of that article. Then at the end, I will place the entire news story in the Record. The news story was on a great success story in American society, the reduction in automobile deaths. While it deals with the State of Washington, I am certain that it is of relatively universal application, to a greater or lesser extent, all across the United States. 
An early paragraph in the article reads: 
The numbers are clear: The state's roads are not just a little safer in the 1990s than in decades past, they're much safer. You're a lot less likely to be in an accident than in earlier times. And if you are in one, you're less likely to be seriously injured or killed. 
Last year, there were 1.3 deaths for every 100 million miles driven on Washington's roads and highways. In 1953, as far back as comparable statistics are available, the figure was four times higher--at 5.1 deaths per 100 million miles. 
Incidentally, Mr. President, 1953 was the year in which I moved to the State of Washington straight out of school. So our roads are now four times safer than they were in 1953. 
The article goes on to speak about causes for this remarkable social success, and says: 
Dr. Fred Rivara, director of Harborview Medical Center's Injury Prevention and Research Center, says the long-term improvement is `clearly due to a combination of a lot of factors'--safer cars, high seat-belt use, air bags, a gradual reduction in drunken driving, construction of interstate highways and improved trauma care for the seriously injured. 
Moffat, of the Traffic Safety Commission, identifies freeway construction as `the single most significant safety factor' because interstates are roughly three times as safe as other roads and city streets. . . . 
They go on to say--and it is relevant directly to the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey-- 
With the freeways built, the traffic-safety focus shifted to drunken driving and the simple defensive measure of encouraging drivers to use their seatbelts. 
`Organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving deserve a lot of credit for bringing that about,' says Rivara. `They succeeded in changing public attitudes about drunk driving.' 
One result has been a renewed effort in Olympia to pass tougher drunken-driving laws. One bill would lower the blood-alcohol concentration for driving under the influence to 0.08 percent from 0.10 percent. . . . 
Precisely what the Senator from New Jersey proposes. 
The state's death rate essentially has remained at its record-low level for the past six years. Further improvement will require a renewed focus on drunken drivers and seat-belt use, Moffat says, because at this stage `belts and booze are the secrets of success.' 
Figures from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration clearly indicate part of the problem. Nationwide, alcohol played a role in about 41 percent of traffic deaths in 1996. . . . In California, the figure was 40 percent and in Oregon, 42 percent. 
But in Washington, alcohol was involved in fully half of all traffic fatalities. Furthermore, NHTSA figures show that the influence of alcohol in traffic deaths hasn't dropped nearly as much in Washington as it has nationally or in California and Oregon. 
Moffat, a Seattle policeman for 25 years before moving to the Traffic Safety Commission in 1995, is convinced that tougher drunken-driving laws are the key to safer roads. Oregon and California both have them, and they work, he says. Moffat estimates that similar legislation here would cut fatalities by at least 10 percent. 
`What that means in real terms is 70 fewer deaths' each year, he says. 
Now, Mr. President, that, in one State, is what we are discussing here in this amendment. In the State of Washington, with roughly 2 percent of the population of the United States of America, approximately 70 fewer traffic deaths per year. 
Now, that figure may be smaller in some States that already have the .08 standard. I suspect it may be larger in those whose drunken-driving laws are less significantly enforced. 
But, Mr. President, this brings it down to the basic level of individual deaths in individual parts of our country. I found that article to be overwhelmingly persuasive. I trust that the legislature of my State will in fact pass a law which is now halfway through the legislative process. But to encourage strongly, to encourage every State to do exactly the same thing is the key to fewer traffic deaths. 
We are not dealing with unknowns here. We are not dealing with predictions. We are dealing with now a history, a history of more than 40 years of keeping track of traffic deaths in my State, a four-times reduction in traffic deaths. And now we have an opportunity to reduce them by another 10 percent, perhaps more than 10 percent through this action. 
It is, Mr. President, action that we ought to take and ought to take promptly.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Tuesday March 3 entitled `Market Power and Structural Change in the Software Industry.' As most of my colleagues know, I am deeply concerned that the true aim of this hearing is not to improve the software industry, but to attack Microsoft and to give the federal government more control over the future of this company. If my suspicions are correct, this attack is not, as some may argue, an attempt to protect the American consumer, but rather, a concerted effort to handcuff Microsoft and provide its competitors with an opportunity to play catch-up that their competitive merits have not provided them in a free market. 
In a recent interview with Salon, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend and colleague Senator Hatch, announced that his committee will release a report the morning of the hearing detailing its findings from an in-depth investigation of Microsoft. That report, no doubt, will claim that Microsoft is engaging in anti-competitive business practices. Releasing such a report only minutes before Bill Gates is scheduled to testify before the committee, without giving him adequate time to read and respond to its allegations, would be grossly unfair. 
I raised these concerns with the committee and was assured that the report would not be released before Mr. Gates has an opportunity to testify. I trust that my friend Senator Hatch will stand by his word and do what is fair and right. 
Witnesses at the hearing include some of the biggest players in the high-tech industry: Bill Gates, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems, Jim Barksdale of Netscape, Michael Dell of Dell Computer, and Doug Burgum of Great Plains. These men and their colleagues in the high-tech industry are responsible for the technological revolution that has taken place in America. Twenty years ago, computers were hulking, outrageously expensive, inefficient machines accessible to only the wealthiest corporations. Today, personal computers are in virtually every business and in many homes and schools. This is the modern day version of the Industrial Revolution. 
Not only are the men and women of the hi-tech industry properly credited with allowing businesses to run more efficiently, making information on virtually any subject imaginable accessible to anyone with a PC and a modem, and providing our schools with increasingly effective learning tools, they are also responsible for the amazing pace of economic growth the United States has witnessed over the past 20 years. 
The computer software industry has grown more than seven times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole, and today provides 600,000 good paying jobs to Americans across the nation. Indirectly, thousands more jobs are provided through subcontractors and small businesses serving these corporations and their employees. Industry revenues totaled $253 billion last year. 
Clearly, Mr. President, the software industry is the quintessential American success story with Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, and Netscape at the helm. The women and men responsible for these amazing achievements should be congratulated and thanked for their contribution to a better, smarter, richer America. 
But, Mr. President, the high-technology industry achieved these successes in a free market environment from which government was virtually absent. Government, of course, always lags behind commerce. When Bill Gates first developed what has today become the world's most popular personal computer operating system, the government didn't even know what an operating system was. When Jim Barksdale invented software enabling the average person to surf the web, the government was nowhere to be found. When Scott McNealy began marketing his Java system products government regulators did not place limits on his business opportunities. 
In fact, I would venture to say that the very corporations attacking Microsoft's successes are those that have gained the most from the absence of government interference in their businesses. But these companies, in their lust to gain a competitive advantage over Microsoft, are now advocating the unthinkable--big government intervention in the industry. 
According to an article in the Financial Times last week, Scott McNealy wants the big hand of government to step in and help his company compete with Microsoft. Mr. McNealy is quoted as announcing to a group of software industry executives in Silicon Valley that, `only with government intervention will we be able to deal with this,' this meaning competition from Microsoft. 
Many other unsuccessful corporate executives, Mr. President, have to come to Congress to petition for government interventions to save them from successful competitors. Only rarely, however, do members of my political party entertain those suggestions. But unfortunately, a member of this body from this side of the aisle, the party known for its embrace of free market principles and rejection of big-government solutions, has joined Mr. McNealy in his efforts not only in calling for a hearing on the matter, but in proposing an entirely new Federal regulatory agency, a `network commerce commission' to regulate online commerce. 
I am flabbergasted. It is truly a strange day when business speaks out against free enterprise and promotes big government. It goes against the grain. 
Sun Microsystems, Netscape and Novell, Microsoft's biggest detractors, are envious of Microsoft's success. Instead of doing business the old fashioned way and marshaling their forces for competition, they are going in a different, more dangerous direction. They are crying for help from big government in order to protect them from their more successful competitor. 
The anti-market forces led by Netscape, Sun Microsystems, and Novell are amassing in a dangerous attempt to pilfer the market share Microsoft has earned by being a leader in the industry, always out in front of the pack with new ideas and solutions. Adam Smith must be turning over in his grave, Mr. President. 
For it is precisely the absence of government intervention that has allowed all of these corporations to succeed. Competition has made this country great. 
America did not become the biggest economic power in the world through government regulation. And those nations that chose the path of government control of the economy are in a shambles today in almost direct proportion to the breadth of those controls. 
When you consider the impact that centralized control in Washington, D.C. has had on our nation's schools and the federal income tax code, I must admit that I'm amazed that anyone in the computer software industry would be calling out for more regulation, influence and decision-making from Washington, D.C. 
Let's consider how the Federal Government's gradual taking of authority from parents, teachers and school boards for education decisions has impacted children in our local schools. Test scores are falling, embittered educators are spending more time filling out forms than teaching our children, and schools are more dangerous than ever in the past. 
Instead of new ideas and new solutions to these problems, Washington, D.C. bureaucrats are capable of only one answer to these challenges--more power for Washington, D.C. to decide how our local schools should be run. I ask my colleagues--based on the current state of public education in America, do you really think that Washington, D.C. bureaucrats know better than parents, teachers and locally-elected school boards what's best for the schools in your state? 
I believe that people in local communities know what's best for their children and their schools, not Washington, D.C. bureaucrats. 
I believe the same for the computer software industry. Knowing how the burdensome hand of the federal government has impacted our local schools, why would anyone in the software industry ask to have Washington, D.C. play a more burdensome role in the future of their industry? 
Another example of how centralized decision-making has hurt American life is the Federal income tax code. 
Instead of a simple, fair tax code in place to fund necessary Government programs, the tax code has become a social-engineering mechanism empowering Washington, D.C. to decide which activities in society should be rewarded, and which activities should be punished. More importantly, our complicated, messy tax code simply gives more control over our daily lives to Washington, D.C. bureaucrats in virtually every Federal Government agency. I ask my friends in the computer software industry--based on how warmly the American people have embraced the current tax code and the Internal Revenue Service, how could you possibly want the same federal government that created the tax monster to take a more powerful role in your business? 
Further, I find it troubling that the request for government intervention has come not from the American consumer, whom our antitrust laws were designed to protect, but from Microsoft's competitors. The consumer has benefited greatly from Microsoft's innovations and the innovations of its competitors. 
Bill Gates, summed it up best in a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal:  
If you asked customers whom they would rather have deciding what innovations go into their computer--the government or software companies--the answer would be clear. They'd want the decision left to the marketplace, with competition driving improvements. 
I vow today to do my best to ensure that consumers get exactly that. 
Microsoft is the American dream, arrived at through hard work and innovation. I want to assure my colleagues that I will not stand by and allow Bill Gates' adversaries to destroy the principles upon which this nation's success is based. I urge those of you who value the free market to join me in my fight against those who want the Federal Government to gain further control over the computer software industry. 
Big government is not now, has never been, and will never be the answer.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1683, legislation to transfer approximately 23 acres of land from the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area to the Wenatchee National Forest. This legislation is supported by both the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service, and would end a 10-year ordeal for my constituent, Mr. George C. Wall. Mr. Wall has been trying since 1987 to shift his 23 acres from the Recreation Area to the National Forest in order to more effectively manage his entire 168 plot of land. S. 1683 is non-controversial and I hope this body will approve it as expeditiously as possible.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here today to speak about one of the federal government's bureaucracies: The Army Corps of Engineers. More specifically, however, I note recent actions and inactions by the Corps that provide excellent examples of a DC government bureaucracy intent on accomplishing its own agenda at its own pace, and out of touch with the American people. 
The first situation I will address involves specific direction by the Congress of the United States. The Corps is required to provide the Senate Appropriations Committee with an outline of its proposed study on the economic, biological and social implications of a drawdown of the John Day Dam reservoir on the Columbia River. Specific instructions were given to provide this information to the Committee within 90 days of the President's signing of the fiscal year 1998 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The President signed the bill on October 13, 1997. As of today, more than 130 days later, we still have not seen the report. 
Mr. President, the Portland District of the Corps sent the report to its Washington, DC, headquarters in mid-December. But, there is still no final document. Assuming that the Corps began work immediately after the bill was approved by the President, or even a month earlier, the field office spent between eight and twelve weeks preparing the report. It has now been nine weeks since it was sent to Headquarters for approval, and we still have no idea when the Corps will finally issue it. Should a document take longer to be approved than it did to be drafted? Apparently, if it is to be approved by the Corps, it does. But it shouldn't. 
Why is this document important? Countless residents of the rural Pacific Northwest rely on the benefits that the Columbia and Snake River dams provide to our region and our nation. If the Corps of Engineers is to study the drawdown of a major multi-purpose federal project like the John Day Dam, it is imperative that its plans be subjected to an open review by those of us sent back here to Washington, DC to represent these communities. Without the formal views of the Corps, these communities are left with excessive and inexcusable uncertainty over the future of their livelihoods. 
Mr. President, I will continue to wait for the Corps to provide a report. I do not intend to wait patiently. 
While I am on the topic of waiting, I will address a second issue. The communities in the Tri-City area of Washington state have been waiting since 1996 for the Corps of Engineers to complete a legally required transfer of riverfront land to local governments. The Corps has claimed that it does not have the funds to begin the process, and although it has recently begun working with the local communities to come to a resolution, it still claims it cannot complete the process without an additional appropriation from this Congress. Along similar lines, the Corps claims that it cannot come up with approximately $60,000 to manage the Wallula, Stateline and Juniper 
Canyon wildlife habitats, and must lease the management of this important, pristine land to the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. This transfer of land management has raised many serious questions in the minds of a number of my Tri-City constituents, who have yet to receive a comforting answer. 
Taken on their own, these incidents might not seem odd. The very same office of the Corps that claims poverty in these latter two cases, however, sees fit to spend freely in other areas. Mr. President, I am sure you are aware of Kennewick Man. Kennewick Man's remains were discovered in July, 1996, on the shore of the Columbia River, near Kennewick, Washington. Using carbon dating techniques, scientist have determined Kennewick Man's remains to be more than 9,000 years old, by far the oldest human remains ever found in North America. This represents a major breakthrough for the study of ancient peoples in North America. 
Mr. President, what would be the logical thing to do with the land on which Kennewick Man was discovered? Should we study if further, or cover it with boulders? Some of our nation's most esteemed anthropologists and archaeologists have answered--as I am sure you or I would--that we should allow the site to be studied further, in the hope that we can learn even more about early North American inhabitants. But that is not the way the Corps sees it. If the Corps has its way, it will helicopter tons of `rip-rap'--large stones--to the river and use them to cover the site, after which it will plant numerous willow trees, completely covering, and possibly destroying, important geological and archaeological evidence. Scientists studying the site claim that this will erect an `impenetrable barrier' to future research. 
How much will it cost to cover this important site? The Corps has not disclosed its estimate, but I have been told by people in the local community that it is likely to cost at least $100,000, and perhaps as much as $250,000. In addition, the Corps claims, that should scientists want to study the site in the future, the boulders and trees can be removed--at a cost of course. How much? Another $100,000. Even then the boulders are likely to have crushed any remaining archaeological objects and possibly changed the chemical makeup of the soil, rendering future tests worthless. 
Mr. President, if the Corps of Engineers cannot come up with $60,000 to manage important wildlife habitats, and cannot put together enough money to begin satisfying its legal requirement to transfer land to local authorities, how can it possibly justify spending upwards of a quarter-million dollars, which the Congress never appropriated, to cover a potential gold mine of archaeological information with boulders and trees? Of course It cannot. In fact, it has not even attempted to do so. The Corps spokesman in Walla Walla has refused to answer specific questions about the pending contract to cover the Kennewick Man site. If this bureaucracy has its way, it will ignore the concerns of the residents of its district, lease important and pristine land to an outside group to manage, and then apparently use that money to cover a site to which countless members of the scientific community have requested access. This is nothing short of unbelievable. 
Mr. President, The Corps of Engineers has a lot of explaining to do. It owes answers to Congress and it owes answers to the people of the Tri-Cities. I sincerely hope it will be more forthcoming in the near future than it has been in the recent past. If not, I anxiously await an opportunity to question the Corps of Engineers during this year's appropriation process. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is with intense regret that it's my view that this amendment, representing a good-faith attempt by two of my friends and my Republican colleagues, it seems to me, is subject to even more widespread and deeper constitutional objections than the original McCain-Feingold bill--a bill that seems, to this Senator at least, to be unconstitutional on its face. 
The fundamental objection to all of these attempts to limit the freedom of speech, of course, is that they fly in the face of the unrestricted language of the first amendment, language that does not--though the Senator from Maine might wish to permit it to do so--permit exceptions to every general rule. 
This amendment, however, seems to me to violate the 14th amendment in many respects, with respect to both equal protection and due process. This amendment imposes broad and what some may consider to be onerous disclosure requirements with respect to what it calls `electioneering'--on electioneering in certain ways through the mass media, but not at all in other ways, and even in the ways in which it covers electioneering by certain groups and organizations and not by other groups and organizations. 
The Senator from Maine said, during the course of her comments, that she does not think that she could constitutionally apply these requirements to electioneering by mail. She has not applied them to electioneering through newspapers, nor has she applied them to electronic electioneering through the Internet, but only to electronic electioneering by television or by radio. She does that, she says in all candor, because those seem to be the most effective methods of electioneering, the methods of choice by those who have engaged in what the law now calls `express advocacy' and what she calls `electioneering.' 
Well, Mr. President, it seems to me hardly to be subject to argument that you can say that the Government can regulate your speech in one medium, but cannot or will not regulate it through another medium. That is a fundamental denial of the most fundamental of all of our constitutional rights. It does, however, illustrate the flaw in this entire debate, and that is that effective electioneering should be banned, or severely controlled, and that certain kinds of speech are so unfair or so late in a political campaign that we ought not to allow them; and if we have to allow them, we ought to impose on them such heavy restrictions as to discourage them, even though we are going to permit exactly the same kind of communication, as long as it is done in a relatively ineffective fashion. To claim, Mr. President, that the Constitution of the United States, in the first and 14th amendments, permits those distinctions is to fly in the face of all rationale, all logic, and all constitutional law. 
But the amendment doesn't stop there. Even with respect to radio and television electioneering, it makes an exception. What is that exception? It is any news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of a broadcasting station. So now we will have a law that clearly states that no matter how expensive, no matter how unfair, no matter how late in a campaign, a television station or a television network can do whatever it wishes without any of the restrictions of this statute; but no one else can without being subject to the restrictions of this amendment. Is there something that is so much superior in an editorial appearing on a television station over similar opinions expressed by a labor union, or by the Christian Coalition, or by any other political organization, that one should be discouraged and the other should be encouraged? 
Mr. President, that is a terrible policy in any political debate, and it is clearly a policy that is so discriminatory as to run afoul of the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. And, Mr. President, this discrimination doesn't even stop there in distinguishing between a communication paid for by a labor union or the Christian Coalition with one paid for by the facilities of the television station and network. Oh, no. The prohibitions do apply to a television, or a radio station, 
or a network owned or controlled by a political party, a political committee, or a candidate. 
So, Mr. President, we have the spectacle of all of these requirements being applied to a radio station or a television station owned by a candidate, but not applied to the National Broadcasting Company and, say, Tom Brokaw, the company owned by General Electric. So a corporation can purchase a television station or a network and do whatever it wants in politics. But a candidate can't and a political party can't. 
Mr. President, how can that possibly, under any circumstances, be valid under the equal protection clause? How does that grant due process to candidates, political parties, or to any other organization, except for a corporate owner of a television station, a radio station, or a network? 
The Senator from Maine also deals with the NAACP case and says, well, yes, the Supreme Court has ruled rather expressly that you cannot require a group expressing its point of view on a political subject to list its membership. She says every rule has its exceptions and there are certain kinds of organizations where that should be the case, but there are other kinds where it should not. 
Last June, in testimony I think, on a bill like this, top officials of two organizations, Public Citizen and the Sierra Club Foundation, refused to expose the identities of their members.  
`As I am sure you are aware, citizens have a first amendment right to form organizations to advance their common goals without fear of investigation or harassment,' Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook told GNS. 
We respect our members' rights to freely and privately associate with others who share their beliefs, and we do not reveal their identities. We will not violate their trust simply to satisfy the curiosity of Congress or even the press. 
Evidently, the sponsors of this amendment feel that they need pay no attention to that proposition. But I look through the NAACP case without finding the slightest hint that the Supreme Court will oblige the sponsors of this amendment. The Supreme Court in that case said: 
Effective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly controversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association, as this Court has more than once recognized by remarking upon the close nexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly. . . . It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the `liberty' assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech. . . . It is immaterial whether the beliefs sought to be advanced by association pertain to political, economic, religious, or cultural matters . . . . In the domain of these indispensable liberties, whether of speech, press, or association, the decisions of this Court recognize that abridgement of such rights, even though unintended, may inevitably follow from varied forms of governmental action. 
The Court has recognized the vital relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one's associations. When referring to the varied forms of governmental action that might interfere with freedom of assembly, it said, `A requirement that those in adherence of particular religious faiths or political parties wear identifying armbands is obviously of this nature. To compel the disclosure of membership in an organization engaged in the advocacy of particular beliefs is of the same order. Inviolability of privacy in group association may, in many circumstances, be indispensable to the preservation of freedom of association.'

Mr. GORTON. Now, Madam President, that is not a statement of the Supreme Court of the United States that is going to admit exceptions and say, oh, well, we really didn't mean it in a political race, we really didn't mean it in connection with an advocacy organization like the Christian Coalition or the labor unions; though, perhaps, we did mean it with respect to television networks. They will not do that. 
Madam President, with respect to this attempt to limit freedom of speech, the views of the American Civil Liberties Union are particularly eloquent, and I do want to share just a handful of them at this point on this specific amendment. 
We are writing today . . . to set forth our views on an amendment to that bill dealing with controls on issue advocacy which is being sponsored by Senators Snowe and Jeffords. Although that proposal has been characterized as a compromise measure which would replace certain of the more egregious features of the comparable provisions of McCain-Feingold, the Snowe-Jeffords amendment still embodies the kind of unprecedented restraint on issue advocacy that violates bedrock First Amendment principles. 
They go on eloquently to discuss exactly this proposition. 
They say, `The Court'--referring to the Supreme Court--`fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even though such advocacy might influence the outcome of an election. The doctrine provides a bright-line objective test that protects political speech and association by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not on the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact on the speaker's audience, or the proximity to an election.' 
Madam President, this proposal is blatantly unconstitutional. It is overwhelmingly discriminatory among organizations engaged in identical activity. It is overwhelmingly discriminatory in treating the forum or the particular medium by which a group advocates its views differently depending solely on the sponsor's views on the effectiveness of that particular medium in influencing the outcome of an election. It discriminates between a commercial corporation ownership of a television or radio medium and a political ownership of the same medium. 
Madam President, it is exactly these prohibitions that the first amendment of the United States to the Constitution of the United States was designed to prohibit. And, of all forms of speech, the first amendment was aimed primarily at political speech. Here we have an attempt not only to ration political speech but to discriminate against certain forms of political speech and in favor of other forms of political speech, thus accomplishing the goal of violating not only the first amendment but the 14th amendment as well. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads in relative part `Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.' 
Today, once again, we are engaged in a debate in which the proponents propose to limit the freedom of speech, and most particularly, to limit freedom of speech in political debate about the policy and political future of the United States. 
At the time of an identical debate last fall, George Will wrote, and I wish to quote him in full: 
Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus `speech codes,' nor the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism, or the 1920s `red scare,' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' advancing under the protective coloration of political hygiene. 
Mr. Will concludes by saying: 
As Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and others filibuster to block enlargement of the Federal speech-rationing machinery, theirs is arguably the most important filibuster in American history. 
Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has just said that fewer people vote because of cynicism about the 1996 campaign and the blatant violations of the present law that took place during the course of that campaign. 
Mr. President, the cure for the blatant violations of present campaign laws is not a new set of laws. It is the simple enforcement of the laws we already have. Laws, incidentally, that were passed in 1974 with arguments identical to those that are being made here today; laws that themselves seem to have been accompanied by a drop-off in the number of people who are voting. 
If we simply look at our history and desire to have more people voting, we would presumably repeal all of those laws and go back to a pre-1974 situation in which at least we had a greater participation in our election process. 
So what do the proponents today ask us? They ask us to limit severely the right of political parties to raise money and to use 
that money in order to express the ideas that motivate those political parties. In other words, they ask us to limit the ability to communicate the freedom of speech of those organized parties that have spanned most of the history of the United States, parties that most academics studying our political system say are too weak, not too strong. Most academics in this field feel that party discipline ought to be stronger rather than weaker. Yet the heart of McCain-Feingold is the philosophy that parties should not be able to communicate their ideas to people during election campaigns in any significant fashion whatever. 
The predecessors of those who make these arguments today successfully limited the ability of political candidates for Congress to raise and to spend money and now criticize the very condition that they caused by saying that candidates spend too much time in raising money. It is a paradoxical set of arguments to say that the very cause that we espoused has caused candidates to spend too much time campaigning or raising money for campaigning and therefore we ought to have more laws of exactly the same type. 
Mr. President, whatever the constitutionality of limiting the right of people to contribute to political parties and the right of political parties to solicit contributions, it can hardly be proposed with a straight face that we can limit the right of third parties, of independent organizations, to express their ideas on matters of politics and on candidates and on incumbents at any time, much less in the 30 or 60 days preceding an election. There is simply no indication in any decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that such limitations are appropriate. There is also no indication that such limitations are a good idea. 
I wonder what the editorial page of the New York Times would say if the proposal before the Senate today said that newspapers would be limited to one or two editorials about election-year politics and none at all in the 30 days before an election. Yet, Mr. President, unless you can say in order to make elections fair, in order to give each citizen an equal right to participate, we can and should tell the New York Times, and every other daily newspaper in the country, all television networks and television stations, that they should shut up in the 30 days before an election takes place and let the election work its way out on the basis of whatever individual candidates say--unamplified, of course, by any mass media--and that even outside of that period of time they should be strictly limited in the number of statements that they ought to make about politics because, after all, they have a much larger voice than does an individual citizen. 
We know exactly what they would say. They would say that is a blatant violation of the first amendment of the Constitution. They would go to court and they would get any such statute immediately thrown out. But if the New York Times and NBC and an individual television station are free to communicate their ideas about politics and about political candidates without restraint, how, then, can an organization, whether it is the Christian Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, a liberal or a conservative organization, be so limited? And why, if an organization of that nature can't be limited, should a political party be limited in what it can say and how it raises money in order to make any such statement? 
Mr. President, all we have done is to make political speech less responsible rather than more responsible. We limited the amount of money candidates can get, and candidates, of course, can be called to account for any misstatement they make in a political campaign or for any unfair tactics. We now propose to limit the parties to which those candidates belong, so we force those who are interested in the political system whose lives are affected by the political system to operate entirely independently of parties or of candidates and to make whatever statements they wish for which those candidates and parties will, of course, bear any responsibility whatever. 
Finally, I find it extraordinarily curious that the proponents of this bill--most recently the Senator from Minnesota--will 
say that the original proposal before the Senate by the majority leader, Senator Lott, is a poison pill. Now, what is that poison pill? It is the totally constitutional and totally valid requirement that a labor organization to which people in given bargaining units must belong and to which they must contribute can only use the dues and the payments of their members for political purposes with permission. Now, this is the one area which is not only obviously constitutional but obviously desirable. Why should any American, why should any American have his or her money used by an organization to which he or she is required to belong to promote an idea and candidates with which whom he or she disagrees? 
I do have in this connection, Mr. President, one advantage over, I believe, every other Member in this body, except for my own colleague from the State of Washington. In 1992, at a time in which Bill Clinton won the State of Washington in his Presidential campaign, the people of my State passed Initiative No. 134 by a 73-27 percent margin. 
Initiative 134 simply said that neither an employer nor a labor organization could withhold a portion of a worker's wages or salary for political contributions without receiving written permission from that worker each and every year--the so-called `poison pill,' which is anathema to Members on the other side. Seventy-three percent of the citizens of the State of Washington voted for that proposition, Mr. President. 
Now, what happened? Let's take one such organization, the Washington Education Association. Immediately after the passage of that initiative, fewer than 20 percent of the members of the Washington Education Association gave that association permission to use their money for its political purposes. Where it had 45,000 members who were constrained to contribute to its political action committee previously, the figure, after the election was over, was 8,000. Well, that is why 45 members on the other side of the aisle feel the Lott bill to be a `poison pill,' because it deprives one of their principal supporters of the right to force people to contribute to their campaigns. That is a `poison pill,' Mr. President. It is a `poison pill' to restrict political parties the right to speak and the right to effectively participate in politics, or even to restrict certain other organizations. 
Mr. President, I understand--and perhaps the Senator from Kentucky will enlighten me on this--that the United Kingdom had similar restrictions to those proposed here with respect to issue advocacy. If my understanding is correct, the court of the European Community has just determined that those restrictions were a violation of human rights; is that correct? I ask the Senator from Kentucky that question.

Mr. GORTON. If I may conclude, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for those comments. In reflecting back on the article from which I read excerpts by George Will, if we had detailed Congressional Records of what was said in Congress in 1797 and 1798, at the time of the Alien and Sedition Act, I think we would see a philosophy quite similar to the philosophy that is being expressed by the proponents of McCain-Feingold: People aren't smart enough to know what ought to be said or not said or to sort out the quality of what is being said and not said, unless we here in Congress tell them who can say it, when they can say it, and how much of it they can say. This bill, under those circumstances, Mr. President, does have distinguished antecedents, the most significant of which is the Alien and Sedition Act. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GORTON. `People need a vision greater than themselves. Without a vision, there is no goal. This vision has to be larger than yourself. It has to dignify you. Then, goals become the navigational stars to guide you in the vision.'--Stanley O. McNaughton. 
These are the words Stanley O. McNaughton lived by until his sudden death on January 19th. 
Stan McNaughton was a man who rose from modest beginnings in a small British Columbia town, who would later become the CEO of PEMCO Financial Services and who would leave behind one of the greatest legacies of goodwill Washington state will ever see. 
I could spend an evening recounting Stan's business successes. I could spend even greater time speaking of Stan's dedication to community service, his exceptional character, integrity and the countless personal accolades. Yet the two worlds are intertwined. The man who was once named Seattle-King County First Citizen and Seattle University alumnus of the year relied on the same values to achieve personal and professional success and improve the lives of others. 
As Stan used to say, `Our security lies in our values. And from values flow principles.' 
Stan placed profound importance on family, philanthropy, and leadership. 
Stan donated money to causes involving children and education, and often said: `A corporation is the greatest vehicle ever created to do good. Corporations have a responsibility to raise the quality of life in the communities where they do business.' 
I know I can speak for all of us by saying: Stan McNaughton succeeded in leaving his community a better place. 
Tomorrow in Olympia, the extraordinary life of Stan McNaughton will be honored with a Medal of Merit, one of the highest awards that the State of Washington can bestow upon a citizen. to quote from the resolution: `Stanley O. McNaughton exemplified the best characteristics of an employer and community leader by his constant concern and activities for those employed by him and others in the community.' 
Stan had the amazing ability to see the potential in everyone, inspiring his employees, friends and family to be the best they could possibly be. There are countless `Stan stories': the woman who remembered the time Stan sent her child a birthday card; the man who lost his wallet and Stan offered to reimburse the money; the donations to charities, particularly those that benefitted people disadvantaged through no fault of their own; and his special efforts to know every name of the more than 1,000 PEMCO employees. 
Of course, there is the definitive `Stan story' of the great lengths he went to for one of his employees, Mark Roberts who had broken his neck and become paralyzed from the neck down. Stan could have sent a card or even a bouquet of flowers, but in true Stan McNaughton fashion, Stan went the extra mile. He assured Mark he would still have a career at PEMCO and went about changing the dynamics of Mark's job. By computerizing much of the workload, Stan made it possible for Mark to succeed and recover from what would have ordinarily been a career ending accident. Stan even went so far as to buy Mark a specialized van, for his professional and personal use. 
Stan McNaughton touched the lives of so many different people. His personal philosophy of seeing life as a batting average: `You must give people enough chances at bat' represents the spirit of this great leader and sets an example for all of us to follow. 
My heart goes out to his wife Clare of 55 years, his six children, and 10 grandchildren. 
Stnaley O. McNaughton will be very much missed.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to state that I intend, with my colleague from Washington state, Senator Murray, to introduce legislation shortly after this recess to ensure fair management of Dungeness crab on the West Coast. The legislation is supported by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and represents an agreement reached by industry representatives, tribal representatives, and state fishery management agencies in Washington, Oregon, and California. The legislation will extend and expand the current interim authority for these states to manage Dungeness crab beyond three miles from their shores. 
Historically, the crab fisheries off the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington have been managed by the three states, and through cooperative agreements between them. The state jurisdiction, however, extends only to three miles. This limitation is particularly significant in Washington state, where approximately 60-80 percent of the crab is caught beyond three miles. While states can regulate their own fishermen beyond three miles, they have not historically been able to regulate fishermen from other states. 
Although Washington, Oregon, and California have all adopted limited entry programs to conserve and manage crab, Oregon vessels can and do fish for Dungeness crab in waters more than three miles off Washington, and, until interim authority was granted in 1996 in the Sustainable Fisheries Act, Washington could not regulate these vessels. The same, of course, was true of Washington vessels fishing off the coast of Oregon. 
The problem with the inability to manage out-of-state vessels beyond three miles became critical in 1995, when a Federal district court allocated a large portion of the crab to Indian tribes, and threatened in this way to deprive non-tribal fishermen, who have been fishing for generations, of their livelihoods. Without the ability to regulate vessels from Oregon, all of the allocation to the tribes would come from Washington non-tribal fishermen. This simply is not fair. The bill I will introduce will continue to give the fishery managers in Oregon, California, and Washington, the authority to regulate all crabbers equally in the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the state. This regulatory authority will help to ensure that the cost of the tribal allocation will be borne more fairly by all commercial crabbers who fish in the EEZ adjacent to Washington, not just crabbers whose vessels are registered in the state. 
As I mentioned, in 1996, I succeeded in obtaining a provision in the Sustainable Fisheries Act, which gave limited interim authority to the West Coast states to manage the Dungeness crab fishery beyond three miles. This interim authority expires in 1999. It was anticipated that the Pacific Council would, by that time, prepare a Fishery Management Plan that could be delegated to the states. The Council has determined, however, through a careful, public, and inclusive process, that, given the unique nature of the West Coast fisheries in which you have effective state management, cooperation among the states, and agreement on the legislation I will introduce, there is no need for Federal management of this fishery. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure quick passage of the bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I intend to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to Senator Frist's bill this morning because I believe it is imperative that we move the debate on human cloning forward. The lightening pace of scientific and medical advances, while holding immeasurable promise, often leaves society unprepared to answer the moral and ethical questions that follow. The technology used to clone `Dolly' the now famous Scottish sheep, somatic cell nuclear transfer, clearly should not be used to clone a human child; this is neither a moral nor medically ethical procedure. Yet it is clear that the scope of possibility for this new technology has not been fully explored. It may hold the potential to develop new lifesaving therapies for diseases that have historically plagued mankind. Can we close the door on new opportunities to heal cancer patients, those afflicted with Alzheimers, or burn victims? 
Few of us in this body have background in science, medicine, or medical ethics. Yet we are being asked to make decisions that have tremendous consequences for the lives of every American. We are being asked to examine some of our fundamental beliefs about life and the ethical use of science. We must be exceedingly cautious before legislating in an area we admittedly know little about. 
I commend Senator Frist for his leadership in bringing this issue before the Senate. I hope that we can reach consensus; that prohibiting the use of somatic cell nuclear technology to produce a human child and promoting responsible biomedical research are not mutually exclusive goals. But we cannot do so unless we thoughtfully debate the issue; we cannot ignore it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, while the Senate is conducting its morning business, a conference is being held in Georgetown by the Progress & Freedom Foundation (PFF) on an issue that has gotten a great deal of attention over the past few weeks. From the conference title--Competition, Convergence and the Microsoft Monopoly--one might be deceived into believing these are frightening times for American consumers. 
Any fears about the success of Microsoft isn't coming from those who buy Microsoft products, but from frustrated competitors. While I don't dismiss the concerns expressed by anti-Microsoft factions, their arguments certainly lack force when consumers appear to be so completely uninterested in this tale. 
In fact, that's the untold story in the drama of the past several months--what does the consumer think of all this? How are American consumers being impacted? These questions are appropriate when you consider that the anti-trust laws of this country came into being to encourage competition and to protect consumers, not to settle bickering among business competitors. 
Unfortunately, a lot of words have been printed and broadcast on this subject, but we've hardly heard a peep from the people who matter most--the consumers. This concerns me precisely because it appears that so many people participating in this dispute have already decided who gets to wear the black hat, and who the white. 
At this morning's event my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who chairs the very committee that exercises jurisdiction over the antitrust laws, spoke to the PFF conference about the Microsoft dispute. Normally, I don't keep track of where my colleagues make speeches and what they speak about, but because Senator Hatch has been quoted in the news media as taking a very hard anti-Microsoft line, I feel compelled to share some of his statements with my colleagues and rebut some of the criticism that he, and other Microsoft critics, have tossed out in the past several weeks about one of America's most visible, and successful, companies. 
On Jan. 25th, Senator Hatch spoke at length to the San Jose Mercury News about Microsoft and his competitors, and I was surprised by the tone of his remarks. The newspaper quotes Senator Hatch as saying, `if Microsoft has engaged in driving out competition, and I think it has--most everybody who's looked at it carefully believes it has--and takes control of (Internet standards), they're going to exercise a tremendous amount of control over Internet content and commerce.' Senator Hatch goes on to say, `if they're using anticompetitive practices to achieve that, it's wrong--and we have to do something about it.' 
In light of Senator Hatch's comments, I am concerned about how Microsoft is treated on Capitol Hill. Fortunately, Senator Hatch has promised that the Judiciary Committee has no intention of interfering with [the Microsoft litigation] and as our examination goes forward, we will work in a bipartisan manner to ensure that it continues to be fair and balanced. (Feb. 3 letter to Gorton/Murray) 
I appreciate this statement, but I must admit it concerns me when he speaks at a conference that refers to Microsoft as a `monopoly.' 
Having said that, I would like to begin my comments on the Microsoft investigation by making a couple of points: 
First, the question of whether the company has violated antitrust laws is something of an abstract question that has been posed, not by American consumers, but by Microsoft's competitors. I believe that to be the key of this entire discussion, and why I feel so strongly that Microsoft is being treated unfairly. This isn't an effort led by those who purchase software products . . . if it were, you can be sure that my attitude would be much different . . . this fight was started by those who must compete with Microsoft, which, in my opinion, makes it very hard for those individuals and companies to make an argument that is not completely driven by their self-interest. 
Let's remember why we have anti-trust laws in this country--these laws weren't written to preserve unsuccessful competitors; they were written to encourage competition, and thereby protect consumers. And to date, I haven't seen one bit of evidence to support the theory that consumers are being hurt by Microsoft's success, or the success of any other company in the software industry. 
Second, as a former state attorney general, I support government enforcement of antitrust laws, but I cannot support the DOJ's attempts to restrict Microsoft's ability to produce and market the full-featured products its customers demand. Product design decisions should be made by software developers responding to consumer demand in the marketplace, not by governmental agencies. 
And so on behalf of the American consumer, indeed the American economy, I'd like to review a few facts that we simply should not overlook today. 
From 1990 to 1996, the number of software companies in the United States grew 81 percent, from 24,000 to 44,000 companies. 
During the same period, employment in the American software industry grew 70 percent, to more than 600,000 jobs today. 
The industry generated direct wages of more than $36 billion in 1996, and another $83 billion in related sectors of the economy. 
It generated $7.2 billion in taxes paid to federal and state governments, and another $7.9 billion through the `ripple' effect. 
Venture capital investment in new technology companies is at an all time high--$2.4 billion invested last year alone. 
Prices for personal computer hardware and software are constantly falling. Where a single Microsoft application such as Microsoft Word cost $399 in 1990, today consumers can acquire all of Microsoft Office (which includes word processing, spreadsheet, presentations, scheduling and other functionality) for just $499 at retail. 
If Microsoft's competitors are right, how could all of that success taken place? Wouldn't logic tell us that if a `Microsoft Monopoly' actually existed, prices would be higher, job growth would be lower, and venture capital investment would be next to nothing? Yet, the facts show the opposite course. 
Also, I think it's important to remind ourselves that all of these accomplishments took place without government regulation or interference. 
Let's review that again: Competition in the American software industry is not only healthy but vigorous. America leads the world. Innovation is at an all-time high. Employment is flourishing. Prices continue to fall for consumers and businesses alike. Productivity is skyrocketing. And barriers to entry for any company or individual that wants to compete in this industry are low. 
The principal assets required to create software are human intelligence, creativity and a willingness to assume entrepreneurial risk. All of the hallmarks of a thriving, healthy industry are in place in America's software industry. 
Let's return now to this question--what is the basic goal of antitrust law in America? 
I believe that the basic goal of our anti-trust laws is to promote competition, thereby insuring that consumers benefit from the widespread availability of goods and services at fair prices. Often competition is vigorous, but the fact that certain companies perform better than others is no reason to doubt that consumers benefit greatly from their success. As many courts have recognized, all companies should strive to do as much business as they can, even if that means taking business away from rivals, because it is that quest that causes the creation of new and better products offered to consumers at attractive prices. 
So, why are a handful of Microsoft's competitors so successful at scaring up government investigations, public policy debates and media scrutiny? One might argue that all of these incredible statistics that I've just reviewed are somehow skewed because Microsoft is really the only beneficiary. In other words, all of the benefits accrue to Microsoft. Well, that's just wrong. Once again, the facts tell another story: 
The top 20 companies in the industry account for only 42% of the total revenues from packaged software sales--demonstrating that the software industry is highly competitive and decentralized. 
Microsoft represents less than 4% of total worldwide software industry revenues. In 1996, total software industry revenues were $250 billion; Microsoft's portion was less than $10 billion. How can there be a `Microsoft Monopoly' if Microsoft accounts for less than 4% of industry revenues? If such a monopoly existed, shouldn't that percentage be more like 60%, 70%, 80% or higher? 
But what about Microsoft's dominance in the PC software space? Well, a few more facts: 
In online services, Microsoft represents only 9.8 percent of the online services sector. America Online has 75 percent. 
Database software: Microsoft represents only 6 percent of the database software sector, compared to Oracle's 30 percent share. 
E-mail software: Microsoft represents only 14 percent of e-mail software revenues, compared to 43 percent for IBM/Lotus. 
Server operating systems: Microsoft represents only 27 percent of server software revenues, compared to 41 percent for Novell. 
Again, where is the monopoly? Percentages of 9.8, 6, 14 and 27 hardly sound like monolopies to me. 
So we're still left to ponder, why the fuss over Microsoft, given all of this good news? This is the question so many in the media are striving to answer. The New Republic recently attributed it to techno-angst--society's anxiety about the Information Age and its desire to focus that angst on someone or some company. 
I think a more plausible answer is a coordinated PR and lobbying campaign by a handful of Microsoft's competitors. Two weeks ago, the author and management guru James Moore wrote in The New York Times:  
The courtroom drama played out in Washington in recent weeks concealed what was happening backstage: a small number of companies that compete with Microsoft have managed to make the Federal Government an unwitting tool of their narrow competitive objectives. 
These sorts of unholy alliances almost always lead to bad policy. If users are better served, if the cost of software is reduced and if new layers of information-industry innovation are built, a strong argument can be made that the public good is being achieved without Government intervention. 
The public good is being achieved without Government intervention. This cannot be overemphasized. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has played an important role in developing intelligent public policy with an eye toward limiting the role of government in markets. In 1995, PFF published a major study on the need to replace the FCC and substantially deregulate the telecommunications marketplace. Today, PFF is conducting a major project designed to limit government interference in the market for digital broadband networks. I applaud PFF's efforts on behalf of the free market in those industries, and am somewhat mystified by the organization's apparent inconsistency with regard to Microsoft and the software industry. Based on the organization's past, I simply want to encourage the Progress and Freedom Foundation to remain steadfast in its belief in the American marketplace. 
Now, I'd like to turn for a moment to addressing some of what I will call the myths out there about Microsoft. I think it's important that we deal with some of the less scholarly thinking and ideas up front. 
Myth #1: Microsoft is somehow going to control access and commerce on the Internet. 
I was amused to see a press release earlier this week from the New York Attorney General's Office making this claim. It's almost as though the PR campaign being championed by several Microsoft competitors who have decided these buzzwords have the most media appeal. Anyone who goes out onto the Internet to find the world of knowledge and information available there knows that no one will ever control access and commerce on the Internet. Such a thought is as laughable as suggesting one company will control all commerce and information in the world. The Internet is a vast information source that will continue to grow and expand. No company will ever represent more than a tiny fraction of all the commerce and all the content available on the Internet. 
Myth #2: Some companies are afraid to come forward with complaints about Microsoft because they are afraid that Microsoft will use its dominance in the marketplace to punish them. 
My colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, has made this charge himself in interviews with the news media. This is a serious accusation but one that is also baseless. Microsoft has gone so far as to give the Justice Department a letter that it can present to anyone and everyone doing business with the company encouraging them to cooperate with the DOJ on its investigation. Microsoft has been extremely cooperative for years with the DOJ. And it would be out of character for Microsoft--a company that values its partners--to make this an issue with them. 
Myth #3: Microsoft's license agreements with Internet Service Providers unfairly force ISPs to promote only Internet Explorer, and prohibit ISPs from even mentioning the existence of Netscape Navigator. 
Like PC manufacturers, ISPs know and understand their customers. They provide their customers with choice--whether it's Internet Explorer, Navigator or some other product. Microsoft has no exclusive arrangements with ISPs. This is a non-issue. 
Myth #4: Microsoft is entering into proprietary agreements with Content Providers to create popular websites that can only be viewed using Microsoft's browser. 
Let me be absolutely clear. A consumer can use any browser he or she wants to view any material on the Internet. A content provider may choose to take advantage of technology available in either Internet Explorer or Navigator to make their content even more compelling. 
Content providers like Warner Brothers want to reach the most customers. They aren't looking for exclusionary technology. They are looking for the best technology to serve their customers. Right now Warner Brothers believes that Microsoft has the best technology. There are other content providers that believe Netscape has the best technology. That's what competition is all about. This is similar to saying that manufacturers of VHS videocassette players entered into proprietary deals with Hollywood studios to force their movies on VHS tapes rather than Beta tapes. Just as VHS and Beta were competing standards, so too are Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. May the best technology win. 
Myth #5: The Justice Department is working to restore choice for consumers. 
This is disingenuous at best. Consumers have always had choice. Netscape and thousands of other software programs run wonderfully on Microsoft Windows. In fact, the great untold story is how Microsoft spends more than $65 million and 1,000 Microsoft employees to work with its competitors to build great software applications that run on Windows. 
It's important to understand these myths. Sound public policy must be based in fact, not competitive rhetoric. 
These are exciting times for American consumers and for American business. Microsoft's business model, which is focused on rapid product development, broad distribution at low prices and close collaboration with hardware and software vendors, is helping to drive demand through the high technology sector. We are seeing upgrades to telecommunications networks--telephone, cable, satellite and wireless--the introduction of new types of devices such as hand held computers and automobile PCS--and the creation of innovative new software to make these networks and devices improve the lives of all consumers. 
New technologies and new ideas are being introduced at a dizzying pace--led largely by innovative and highly competitive American companies. 
I've spoken today about the American consumer and the American software industry. I'd like to conclude by talking a little about Microsoft. You can hardly talk about innovation and competition without focusing on Microsoft. It's founder, Bill Gates, is one of the true visionaries of the Information Age and his company has produced technology that will forever change the way we work, play and think. 
I have enjoyed watching this phenomenal man and his company for many years. And over those years, I have seen Microsoft remain committed to four very important business principles that have guided the company since its founding: 
1. Microsoft builds software that improves the quality of people's lives. Bill Gates' vision of Information at Your Fingertips brings businesses closer to their customers, voters closer to their elected officials, doctors closer to their patients and teachers closer to their students. 
2. Microsoft listens closely to its customers and focuses on how it can do a better job. If you want to know the true secret to Microsoft's success, look at its intense focus on incorporating customer feedback into its products. 
3. Microsoft believes that innovation is at the heart of its future. Microsoft will spend more than $2 billion this year on research and development. More than 16 percent of its revenues are dedicated to R&D. Its competitors, Sun and Oracle will spend about 8 percent of revenues on R&D. 
4. Microsoft partners with many companies, large and small, who share these principles. Microsoft's thousands of partners are in every state in America--independent software vendors who build great software products for the Windows operating system, PC manufacturers, solution providers who support and implement Microsoft technology solutions and many other partners. 
In conclusion, I believe that a review of the facts shows that the American software industry is healthy, vigorous, innovative and continually improving the lives of American consumers. Microsoft is one of many aggressive and innovative companies in this industry. Its leadership is an asset for the nation. Its leadership is also not guaranteed. In any dynamic, innovative industry such as software, your position in the market is only as strong as your last product release. The competitive threats to Microsoft are real. 
As PFF, the participants at its conference, and many of my colleagues know all too well, it is the marketplace, not government regulation that will ensure continued innovation and consumer benefits.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I speak here in the U.S. Senate this evening. I share a story of a wonderful and talented young woman, Miss Jenny Lynn Stiles Hudson, whose life was lost tragically in an automobile accident a week ago today, on January 28. 
Jenny was only 21 years old at the time of her death and had just begun a career as my deputy director for eastern Washington. While Jenny was with the Gorton organization only for a few short weeks, she had already demonstrated the talents to be a valuable member of my organization. 
But Jenny Hudson will not be remembered for being a Gorton staffer. Rather, she will be remembered as an amazing and dynamic young woman who accomplished so much in her 21 years and who touched the lives of all around her. 
Jenny grew up in Lyman and Hamilton, in rural Skagit County, north of Seattle. She was a joy and a delight to her family and a participant in almost all of the school and community activities offered to her in that rural setting. 
Jenny graduated from Washington State University only in December of last year. At the university she was active in the Block and Bridle Club, the Livestock Judging Team, the Washington Cattlemen's Association, all while raising and showing Limousin beef cattle throughout the State of Washington. 
Jenny enjoyed swimming and singing. At the same time, she maintained a strong belief in God, working as the youth director of her local church. 
Jenny Hudson will be missed by all who knew her. In her short 21 years, Jenny inspired those around her with her vibrant outlook on life, her ambition and her many accomplishments. An early death reminds us of the sanctity and the fragility of life. Let the lesson of Jenny Hudson's remarkable life be no less deep. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to Jenny's parents, to her husband of just 6 months, Tipton, and to her countless friends and relatives as they deal with this difficult time. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting S. 1297, Senator Coverdell's bill to rename Washington National Airport in honor of former President Ronald Reagan. As we seek to pay tribute to him, it is important for us to reflect upon President Reagan's place in history. Few modern leaders have had such an enduring impact on our lives. 
President Reagan was elected at a critical time in the history of our nation and our world. In the early 1980s, the country was struggling with an economy plagued with high inflation and unemployment. In the wake of Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis, society at large was told by President Carter we were subject to a `national malaise,' not without reason. In addition, our armed forces were underfunded and low in morale. The Cold War still dominated our view of the world. 
Into this unsettled environment, Ronald Reagan was elected president. His determined leadership, strength of conviction, positive attitude, and faith in his fellow Americans helped change the nation and the world profoundly during his two terms. President Reagan's commitment to national security and the men and women of the armed forces gave our military renewed respect and self-confidence. The nation then took a strong stand against the Soviet Union and helped peaceably to bring about the end of the Cold War and the demise of communism. 
President Reagan's view of the role of government still defines the debates we hold in this chamber on a daily basis. He firmly believed that Americans were far better than the government at running their own lives. He also was committed to the free enterprise system and the dynamic spirit of the entrepreneur. Today there are few legislators or other policymakers who cling to the idea that bigger government and more federal spending is good for our economy or the freedom of our citizens. 
Mr. President, one of the more important and lasting contributions of our 40th president was the way in which he was able to restore the confidence and optimism of the United States. President Reagan transformed the so-called `malaise' of the late 1970s into a positive attitude that helped give the country faith in its institutions and its future. That is why he justly remains an immensely popular figure in our history. 
The foregoing account of President Reagan's achievements is only the beginning of a long list of accomplishments that highlight his time as leader of the free world. One more effort he undertook, however, is worthy of note in this debate. As others have mentioned, it was the Reagan Administration that was able to remove the federal bureaucracy from direct control over National and Dulles Airports. By releasing these airports to local control, they were able to go to the private sector for funding and begin needed improvements. The idea of devolving federal control to the States and localities was at the very core of the president's political philosophy. 
For these and many other reasons, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Coverdell's proposal to rename Washington National Airport as `Ronald Reagan National Airport.' Visitors who fly to our nation's capital will always be reminded of the lasting and important contributions made to our country and the world by President Ronald Reagan. I thank the leadership for trying to let us address this bill in time for President Reagan's 87th birthday on February 6, 1998.

 Mr. GORTON. I would like to call attention to Wilfred Woods, who has recently announced he will step down as the publisher of the Wenatchee World newspaper after 47 years. Wilfred is the son of Rufus Woods, who purchased the Wenatchee Daily World in 1907, and was one of the earliest promoters of the Grand Coulee Dam project. Beginning in 1918, Rufus used the pages of the newspaper to promote the concept of using the Columbia River for hydroelectric power as well as for irrigation of the fertile but arid Columbia Basin. Half a million acres are irrigated by the Columbia Basin project. This valuable irrigation project allowed the central Washington desert to bloom and is responsible for producing the valley known as the Apple Capital of the World. 
Wilfred Woods and his late father, Rufus, have played significant roles in the development of central Washington during their 90 years of service. Wilfred succeeded his father as editor and publisher in 1950 and has been an active advocate for resource and economic development in central Washington. He served as a State parks commissioner, a trustee for Central Washington University, and in various capacities in countless civic organizations. 
Wilfred's son, Rufus, will now become the editor and publisher of the Wenatchee World and carry on the great traditions of his father and grandfather. 
Wilfred has been a great personal friend of mine for more than 30 years, dating back to the time I first ran for Washington State attorney general. I have always valued his wisdom, foresight, and the manner in which he and S12719his father guided the Wenatchee World to become one of the State's finest daily newspapers. Wilfred and his father were truly part of a legendary experience that has forever changed the political and economic landscape of north-central Washington. While the Woods family will be remembered most for their influence over the management of the Columbia River system, I will remember Wilfred as a true friend. During my years of touring Washington State for various political engagements and meetings, I always looked forward to my stop in Wilfred's newsroom and valued our countless conversations, whether we were in agreement or not. I will miss our exchange of ideas and his insights into the central Washington community. I wish him continued success in future endeavors.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford in urging that we immediately adopt H.R. 2476, the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. I also recognize Representative Underwood's efforts to facilitate this legislation following the recent crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam, which killed more than 200 people. 
As Senator McCain stated, last year the Congress approved almost identical legislation that required domestic air carriers to establish a disaster support plan for the families of aviation accident victims. The legislation we are now considering would extend this requirement to foreign air carriers if they have an accident on American soil. 
I would note that the Family Assistance Task Force strongly supports this legislation. The task force, which Congress established to find new ways to assist family members and others devastated by an airline crash, recently voted unanimously to endorse this act. The task force also asked that Congress pass this legislation as expeditiously as possible. 
It is unfortunate that airline accidents often provide the impetus to make improvements. The Flight 801 tragedy clearly showed the need to improve planning to assist family members when a foreign airline crashes on American soil. Despite the best efforts of the National Transportation Safety Board and others, the family members of Flight 801 accident victims would have been better served if a plan had been in place. 
As we all know, the news of an air disaster spreads quickly. The media is often reporting about a crash as soon as, if not before, the rescue teams reach the scene. This legislation provides a framework to ensure that family members receive proper assistance. Among other things, foreign airlines would be required to have a plan to publicize a toll-free number, have staff available to take calls, have an up-to-date list of passengers, and have a process to notify families--in person if possible--before any public notification that a family member was onboard a crashed aircraft. These are basic services that anyone should receive. 
Hopefully, it will never be necessary for any foreign airline to use the plans required under this act. In the event of an accident, however, family members of victims are due the consideration and compassion that this legislation provides. 
Again, I want to thank Senator McCain for moving this legislation quickly, and I would urge that we now adopt the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues in the House of Representatives for their recent passage of H.R. 1534, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act. This long overdue legislation will provide a much needed boost to the thousands of homeowners, small landowners, farmers, and others who for years have had their constitutional rights compromised. 
For too long, these landowners have seen their constitutionally guaranteed property rights eroded by expanding Government regulations. I believe the taking or restriction of the use of private property without due process and just compensation is directly contrary to our Constitution. 
This predicament that too many private property owners find themselves in today was not always the case. So strong was the belief in private property ownership that our Nation's Founding Fathers guaranteed it in the Constitution's Bill of Rights. The fifth amendment to the Constitution states: `No person shall be * * * deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.' 
For centuries, this constitutional directive was so respected that the needs of public concerns were adequately addressed without sacrificing private property rights. However, in the 1960's, 1970's, and 1980's our Nation's local, State, and Federal governments began to pass increasingly burdensome regulations governing air, water, land, and other natural resources, most of which had strong policy justification. The net, cumulative result, however, was a serious diminution of private property rights. 
Unfortunately, fighting the Government over a taking in court is not only extremely expensive, it is time consuming and usually futile against the deep pockets of the Government, which has nothing to lose by drawing the battle out for years and years and wearing down opponents. 
More than 80 percent of the time when property owners try to access Federal courts, they are thrown out on procedural grounds, before the merits are even considered. Of the 20 percent who are successful in having their cases heard in Federal court, it takes an average of nearly 10 years of litigation and negotiation to get through the process. 
Governmental bodies at the State and local level often have legitimate reasons for restricting the use of private property for local zoning, environmental protection, and other purposes. Most State and local governments use their power responsibly, respecting the rights of private property owners when making land use decisions. Nevertheless, when a governmental body at any level infringes on an individual's constitutionally guaranteed rights, that person should at least have his day in court. 
H.R. 1534 allows property owners whose rights have been violated the same access to Federal courts that other claimants have. For example, Federal environmental laws are readily enforced in Federal courts. First amendment claims against local governments also have no trouble getting heard in Federal court. Only private property rights are routinely dismissed or delayed. When landowners cannot afford to go to court to protect their legal and civil rights, the Government can use pressure to effectively take the land from the landowner. 
As chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I cannot help but be reminded of one of the most contentious issues that faced our subcommittee this year--the Headwaters Forest land acquisition. For years, the Government tried to use a variety of forestry and other environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act, to force the landowner off a portion of its land. 
The landowner filed a takings suit and now the Government has finally come to the bargaining table offering to pay for the property. As a result at the request of the Clinton administration, our Interior appropriations bill appropriates $250 million for the Headwaters acquisition. I cannot help but think that this landowner would never have received compensation if it had not had the substantial financial resources necessary to fight a long and contentious legal battle. 
H.R. 1534 takes several steps to allow smaller, less wealthy landowners the same access to the Federal courts. Unlike other bills dealing with property rights, H.R. 1534 does not affect any environmental law, impact the budget, or define for the courts when a taking has occurred. Instead, the bill simply attempts to clear the many procedural hurdles that currently prevent most property owners from having their case heard in court in a fair and expeditious manner. 
H.R. 1534 gives a property owner access to Federal court without having to spend years in an endless cycle of administrative appeals with Government agencies. The bill still requires the owner to attempt at least two appeals before going to court--but provides a clear end to the process. H.R. 1534 simply gives property owners the same access to Federal court that other claimants have. 
Opponents of this legislation argue that this bill undermines the authority of State and local governments in zoning disputes. If this were the case, I would not be supporting H.R. 1534. I strongly believe that land use decisions should be made at the local level to the greatest extent possible. I believe in most cases it is in the best interests of landowners to have their cases decided at the local level. Rather than giving property owners another avenue or authority to sue cities and localities in Federal court, the House passed bill simply allows the decision to be made on the facts of the case without spending 10 years litigating on procedural questions. 
Under H.R. 1534, local officials will still be in control of local zoning decisions. The Federal courts have consistently upheld local authority to make these decisions. The only role the Federal courts are given under this bill is the one they already have: to interpret the Constitution and determine whether individuals rights have been violated. 
Passage of H.R. 1534 will be a small but significant step in the battle to restore private property rights. The issues of compensation and adequate notification of landowners when takings occur also need to be addressed by this body. Nevertheless, passage of H.R. 1534 is a positive step. As a cosponsor of companion legislation S. 1204 introduced by Senator Coverdell, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation soon and hope the President will sign this moderate bill when it comes to his desk.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, late last week the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, and I introduced broad-based electricity restructuring legislation. Each of us spoke to that legislation at that time. We expressed the belief that this first bipartisan approach to a major national issue facing the country would trigger even more serious consideration than has been given during this first session of this Congress to that subject, and expressed the hope, which I repeat here, that it is an issue that will seriously be considered by both Houses of Congress during the course of the next year. 
One major portion of that bill, S. 1401, is a title dealing with the Pacific Northwest fish and the management of the Columbia River system. I greatly appreciated Senator Bumpers' willingness to put his name on those regional provisions, as he did in my case, I believe, with respect to the provisions dealing with the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
This morning I wish to speak briefly on the fish and wildlife issues that are a part of S. 1401. The bill does not address, Mr. President, except in the most general way, the critical need for an improved `river governance' process, especially with respect to issues relating to fish and wildlife. This omission should not be misinterpreted. Legislation may well be needed in this area to assure that the multiple purposes of the Federal power system are protected together with the public benefits that they bring. 
I hope that over the next several months the region can reach a consensus on these issues, including who pays the costs associated with needed actions. Bonneville ratepayers currently fund this effort through their power rates at a cost of $435 million a year on average, and their ability to make additional contributions to this effort and still meet other statutory obligations is increasingly constrained by an increasingly competitive, deregulated wholesale electric energy market. In forging a financing package, it will be important to look to all who benefit from this important natural resource to assume their fair share of financial responsibility, and to act consistently with sound business principles by holding administrative costs to as low a level as possible. 
Money alone, however, is not the answer. Today, the salmon recovery effort is failing. It is failing because of a flawed process for decisionmaking. This process has conflicting goals. It disperses decisionmaking authority among many Federal and State agencies and tribes and has little accountability for cost effective results. 
To make real progress, we need a regional plan; a plan in which all governmental interests--States, tribes, and the Federal Government--are partners, together with economic and environmental interests, for success. And success will mean the achievement of clearly defined goals measured by unambiguous results; results that rely on the best science of how to improve the survival of downstream smolts and that assure adequate escapement of returning adults to the spawning beds. 
All northwesterners care about our salmon resources. We argue sometimes about the best way to reach our shared goals but it is vital to remember that we share the goal of preserving and protecting our anadromous and resident fish and wildlife while also providing a reasonable and continuing harvest for Columbia River tribes, commercial fishermen, and sports anglers. 
I will continue to listen to the stakeholders interested in a comprehensive approach. I am aware that the region's Governors and their transition board may look to a group of `three sovereigns'--Federal, State, and tribal--to construct such a framework, together with other economic and environmental stakeholders. This and other creative thinking on how to maintain both the economic and public benefits of the Bonneville system will be critical to Congress as we move forward with this legislative package. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise for two brief colloquies with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I first want to bring to the distinguished chairman's attention some confusion regarding the committee's intent for approximately $6 million of the Army Corps of Engineers' budget. This money was intended to fund a very important project in Washington State. Unfortunately, we have been informed by the local Corps of Engineers office that without more specific direction from Congress, the agency cannot spend these funds. The Senate accepted the House position on this project, which was to provide $6 million for the Corps of Engineers to extend the south jetty at the Grays Harbor project to provide a permanent solution to the ongoing erosion problem. Would the chairman agree that my description of where these funds will be spent is consistent with the Conference Committee's intention?

Mr. GORTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My second colloquy pertains to an additional $2 million from the Corps budget that should be allocated to dredge, monitor, and maintain the channel to determine the potential for cost effective maintenance near the Willapa River. Regrettably, the direction that our committee gave the Corps did not adequately distinguish between two phases of the Willapa Project. The first phase, which called for beach nourishment to protect the highway from wave erosion has been completed. The second phase, calling for channel dredging, monitoring and maintenance, has yet to be started. It was the original intention of the project proponents that the $2 million allocated for this project be directed to its second phase. The local office of the Corps of Engineers has indicated that it can spend the funds appropriately, provided it be given the necessary direction by Congress. Mr. chairman, given this misunderstanding, do you have any objection to the Corps using these funds for this purpose?

I also want to commend the chairman of the Energy and Water subcommittee, Senator Domenici, whose efforts were crucial to securing the necessary funds.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for working with me over the past few weeks, and in particular the past few days, to enact legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Research, Engineering, and Development (R,E&D) account for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
Senators McCain, Hollings, and Ford joined me in introducing this important legislation. The Commerce Committee recently took up the House bill and reported it out with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The leadership of the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Science Committee have already met to resolve the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. I am pleased to report that the floor amendment to H.R. 1271 reflects the agreement that the conferees have reached on a final package. The House should be able to accept and approve H.R. 1271, as amended, before this session ends. 
The FAA R,E&D account finances projects to improve the safety, security, capacity and efficiency of the U.S. aviation system. These significant research and development efforts include the development of new fire-resistant insulation materials for use on aircraft, the development of procedures for enhancing terminal area capacity and safety, the improvement of aircraft collision avoidance technology, and a host of other noteworthy projects. 
This bill also fosters the strong public-private partnership that has been established in the aviation research and development area. The FAA, for instance, is working with Boeing to develop a world-class airport pavement testing facility. Boeing is providing one-third of the costs of this project, which total $21 million. This project will help ensure that the U.S. keeps pace with the rest of the world in developing the infrastructure to accommodate the new super jumbo aircraft. 
Again, I commend my colleagues' commitment, and their assistance with this effort.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, despite the efforts in conference of Senator Gregg and his staff, the Conference report provides no funding for a Puget Sound crab license buyback. I deplore this omission, which reportedly resulted from the House conferees' resistance to providing Federal funding for buyouts in State fisheries. Mr. President, even if Federal funding of buyouts in State fisheries was not specifically authorized, as it is, in section 312 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, I firmly believe that the Federal Government has a particular responsibility to the nontribal commercial Dungeness crabbers in Puget Sound who have lost 50 percent of their stock as a result of a Federal court interpretation of a Federal treaty. 
This is not an instance in which the hardship the buyout would have alleviated resulted from past actions or inactions on the part of commercial fishers. Overfishing and poor management are not to blame. Rather, this hardship was judicially imposed. In 1995, a Federal district court determined that Indian tribes were entitled by Federal treaty to take up to 50 percent of the harvestable shellfish. The small, 250 vessel non-tribal commercial Puget Sound crab fishery that had existed for generations, was suddenly overwhelmed. I understand that because of the Federal court order, there are now about 450 additional tribal crab fishers. 
Mr. President, the majority of the nontribal commercial crabbers in Puget Sound are self-employed. The vessels they own may account for a large portion of their assets. As the Governor of Washington State, Gary Locke, has stated, `The federal court action leaves them in a difficult financial position with vessels, equipment and related debt tied to an occupation that is no longer viable at its current licensed capacity.' Again, I deeply regret the House conferees' failure to assume Federal responsibility for the consequence of a Federal action.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am going to vote enthusiastically for this bill, the result of countless hundreds of hours of work on the part of the chairman and the ranking minority member, other members, and their staffs. It does make many, many decisions that are important for the future of our country. 
I am, however, deeply disappointed that one element in the bill that passed the Senate of the United States is not included in this bill, an element that was vitally important and provided a vitally necessary reform for our schools. For decades now, Washington, DC, has assumed increasing control over our local schools. Washington, DC has not, however, put its money where its mouth is. With Congress appropriating about 7 percent of the money spent on education, we have allowed our bureaucrats to impose half or more than half of the rules and regulations that so often frustrate innovation and success in our schools. During the past few years, on the other hand, I have listened to countless parents, teachers and principals who almost universally agree that it is time for Congress and the President to restore the authority that our teachers, parents, and local school boards once had to make decisions for our schools. 
In September, I proposed a sweeping reform to improve education for kids in schools everywhere in America. That reform would have given Federal education dollars directly to local school districts so that parents, teachers and principals would have the money and authority to make the best decisions for their children. They would have been empowered to determine their children's needs and to use their Federal dollars in a manner that is best for kids: For new schools, for lower class sizes by hiring more teachers, to purchase computers, or whatever else citizens in communities all across the United States decided that their schools needed. And they could have done it all without Washington, DC, having told them how to do it. 
That sweeping reform is based on the simple philosophy that Washington, DC, does not know best. I believe that all of the laws passed by Congress and all of the regulations adopted by the Federal Department of Education have failed to reach their goals. I believe teachers in the classroom, principals in our buildings, and local school boards and parents, will make better educational decisions and do more to improve their own schools than will Congress or the Federal Department of Education. 
For most of this century, Washington, DC, has been dominated by people who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control exercised by Washington, DC, is the best way to solve problems, including those in the classrooms. Unfortunately, the approach has not worked. As Washington, DC, has taken power and authority from local school districts, our schools have not improved. Sadly, old habits die hard. That belief in centralized power is still very much alive. When I proposed my amendment, every single Democrat in the Senate opposed it and the President vociferously criticized the approach of returning money and authority directly to our school districts. I suspect that, had a vote been taken in the House, the result would have been almost the same. 
Recently, I attended a Senate Budget Committee education task force hearing, at which Carlotta Joyner from the General Accounting Office testified that in 1997, $73 billion was distributed through literally hundreds of programs and more than 30 Federal agencies to support education in this country. For a great number of those programs, there is no record of whether they have succeeded or failed, and in some cases no way of measuring that progress or lack of progress. The Department of Education did not even account for 
half of that total dollar figure. This complex web of education programs only serves to frustrate the efforts of those who know best how to educate children in this country--parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school board members. 
Over the coming months, I know that many of my colleagues will give speeches in their home States and will almost certainly be required to cover education. I remind my colleagues that when they speak eloquently about local control of schools, they have all had an opportunity in this body to vote for or against that proposition. The conference committee on this bill voted against it. 
Finally, I want to let all of my colleagues know that the fight for restoring the traditional role that parents, teachers and principals play in education is not over. I intend to keep forcing tough votes on my colleagues, tough votes that I believe will eventually lead to letting our school districts do what is best for our children--without being told by Washington, DC, how to do it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has eloquently and adequately described the bill which we are introducing jointly today. He is a leader in this field, and introduced the bill on this subject early this year. He and I, and the occupant of the Chair, have had the opportunity to go through seven workshops on electric power marketing restructuring. During the course of this time, the Senator from Arkansas and I found that we thought very similarly in this field, and we are here together on the floor today to introduce a bill that modifies somewhat, but not in its general philosophy, the proposal that he introduced almost a year ago. 
The goal that we set in this bill is to provide for competition for choice, and ultimately for lower prices for electric power consumers from the largest industry to the individual homeowner all across the 50 States of the United States. We set a deadline for that competition to exist on the 1st of January of the year 2002. We encourage States, several of which have already acted, to provide for their own free and open competition by allowing States that have met the general requirements of this bill before 2002 to do it in their own way--in the way in which their legislatures have decided or may have decided. 
We cover, as the Senator from Arkansas pointed out, the legitimate stranded costs of utilities that have been required to build facilities, some of which may not be completely competitive in an entirely free and open market. We set up a system of independent system operators so that the entire transmission system of the United States will be free and open on equal terms to all potential competitors. 
We encourage the increased use of renewable energy sources by requiring certain minimums increasing in three steps throughout the course of the next 15 years or so but providing credit for those who already have renewable resources--hydropower, solar power, and the other forms of renewable resources which exist at the present time and may exist in the future, and allow the sale of credit from those who already meet or exceed the renewable requirements of the bill--credits that they can sell to others. 
Senator Bumpers has been a true leader in this field, and I am honored and delighted to now join with him in what I believe is the first bipartisan approach to this subject, a bipartisan approach which is going to be absolutely essential to any success. 
At the same time that he has been working with his constituents across the country, I have been listening to my own, and my privately owned and public utility districts, those that produce electricity and those that do not, and the wide range of other existing utilities or potential competitors in the Northwest. 
I represent a State that already has very low power charges. We want to be a part of this process, not so that we can slow down the benefits to others--the entire American economy must and will benefit from this bill--but so that my constituents and consumers will benefit as well from the advent of competition. I am convinced that the outline of this bill does just exactly that. 
We must deal with the peculiar challenges of the largest power marketing authority, the Bonneville Power Administration. We do so in a way that reflects the regional review sponsored by the four Governors of the four Pacific Northwest States during the course of last year. We also call in general terms for a more effective and broad-based management of the Columbia River State System, reflecting all of the multitude of uses of water in that system, and calling for a far more effective use of the billions of dollars that we are spending on salmon recovery. 
So I believe for my own region that we can provide lower power costs, greater competition, better salmon recovery, and a more rational management of the Columbia-Snake River System. 
I believe for the people of the United States as a whole that we can provide for lower power costs, a greater use of renewable energy, more competition, and a better America. 
For those reasons, I am delighted to have been a part at this point of a joint operation with my friend from Arkansas.  
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, legislation was recently introduced in the House of Representatives that would ban all commercial logging on Federal lands. This legislation would be devastating not only for the Pacific Northwest, which is highly dependent on its forest products industries, but disastrous for the entire Nation as well. 
I'm appalled. Let me state that the bill introduced by Representatives McKinney, Leach, McDermott, and others has absolutely no chance of passage. None. Yet, it's another confirmation of the radical nature of our opponents in this debate about managing our national resources. After years of talking about compromise and balance, it's clear by the introduction of this bill that their view is that one of our greatest renewable natural resources shouldn't be used for any constructive economic purpose. The sponsors of this bill are clearly indifferent to human costs and economic disruption this radical policy would impose on our Nation's economy, and particularly on our timber dependent communities. 
Support for this bill--which I repeat, has no chance of passage--comes from the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations that earlier this year endorsed a policy of zero cut of timber on public lands. More recently, during debate on the Interior appropriations bill, many of these same groups supported an amendment substantially reducing the budget for Forest Service roads. Had these groups succeeded, the Federal Timber Sale Program, which already has been reduced by two-thirds over the past decade, would have been reduced by another 50 percent. This was clearly a tactic employed by radical environmental groups with the ultimate goal of eliminating all Federal timber harvests. 
Proponents of a zero cut policy on Federal lands lead an effort to further erode the economic backbone of rural Americans. It is an effort by mostly urban environmentalists--armchair environmentalists--who have forgotten, or who never knew, what it takes to produce fiber and shelter, and are indifferent to the communities and jobs that produce these commodities. 
Published reports about this legislation fail to mention that Federal timber sales are already in severe decline, primarily from the limitations placed on the Forest Service by the Clinton administration's environmental considerations and species protection efforts. In 1987, the Federal Timber Sale Program provided nearly 12 billion board feet of timber. Now, 10 years later, less than 4 billion board feet were sold. This translates to double-digit unemployment in Washington State's timber dependent communities. I cannot imagine how terrible it would be for these already depressed communities if timber harvests were banned on public lands. 
For the record, I would like to note that 23 of Washington's 39 counties have been designated as `distressed' counties under State guidelines, meaning that their unemployment rates have been 20 percent above the State average for 3 years and median household incomes less than 75 percent of the State median. This is, to a great extent, the direct result of economic devastation in our timber dependent communities. 
These are counties with towns like Port Angeles. A pulp mill closure in February resulted in about $17 million in direct payroll losses and hundreds of jobs. As I speak today, representatives from the Port Angeles community are hosting a summit for similarly distressed communities that are finding it hard to survive in an era of declining timber sales. 
These areas of the State do not share the wealth of the booming Seattle economy. In 1996, 75 percent of the timber sold by the U.S. Forest Service was to small businesses. These small operations are predominately headquartered in rural areas; in places such as Forks, WA, where jobs and the community's stability are dependent upon the timber industry. These are communities struggling under existing environmental restrictions and species protection efforts. The recent House proposal would serve as a death blow to these struggling communities. 
Proponents of the zero-cut scheme also erroneously claim it will benefit the Federal Treasury. Nothing could be further from the truth. Despite the fact that annual timber sale revenues dropped by over $462 million due to logging restrictions, the Forest Service Federal Timber Sale Program generates annual net revenues of $59 million to the U.S. Treasury. 
In addition, due to declining timber harvests, imports of softwood lumber between 1992 and 1995 increased by 4 billion board feet. As a result, the average price of an 1,800 square foot new home has gone up $2,000. The environmentalists don't like to talk about the inflationary results of their anti-timber campaigns--where is their righteous indignation when working Americans and families find it increasingly difficult to put a roof over their heads? 
What is most disappointing in this debate is that news articles and extreme 
environmental organizations fail to mention the greatest loser if such a proposal was ever enacted: our public education system. Some 25 percent of the revenue from Federal timber sales goes directly to counties to be used for roads and schools. These counties rely on these Federal revenues. In addition to providing essential local services as schools and roads, these counties also provide direct and indirect services to national forests, national parks, wilderness areas, fish and wildlife refuges, and reclamation areas. Without some timber harvests in these financially-strapped counties, the public education of our children will suffer. 
The argument that the only good harvest is no harvest at all overlooks the fact that up to 10,000 acres of Federal timber lands fall victim to forest fires every year. This does not even take into account the insect and disease outbreaks which ravage thousands of acres of public lands. 
In 1994, devastating wildfires ravaged forests in Washington State. The fires were fueled by the excessive buildup on the forest floor. The forest floor was composed of dead, dying, insect infested, and diseased timber which had built up due to a lack of active management on Federal forest lands, including thinning and removal of insect-infested trees. 
The health of our forests will deteriorate under the status quo, as dead and dying trees are left untouched. 
Thinning, on the other hand will create a desired condition in which more trees will survive because of less competition for a limited amount of available moisture. By reducing natural fuel loads through thinning, removal of underbrush, and dead and dying trees, we will be creating a win-win situation in which our forests will be healthier and our mills will be stronger. 
I think it is also important to note that as I heap scorn on the proposed legislation in the House and its supporters, we are beginning to see a rejection of this extreme approach by dedicated environmentalists who live in timber-dependent communities. Unlike their counterparts in Washington DC, and other urban areas who are busy turning out fundraising letters, these true conservationists send their children to the local schools, see the devastating impact of these radical policies on the local economy, and fear for their lives, livelihood, and homes due to the severe wildfire threat. 
As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it was encouraging to see the progress that is being made at the local level in northeastern California. There, local environmentalists, timber workers, and public officials have crafted a reasonable land management plan that resores balance to our forests known as the Quincy Library Group approach. 
Unlike this approach--a balanced, responsible approach to forest health and forest management--the zero-cut proposal introduced last week in the House does nothing more than carry out the agenda of extreme national environmental organizations. I urge moderate, responsible environmental organizations to join me in soundly defeating the proposal in the House and here, if and when the bill is ever brought before either chamber. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, more than almost any other debate in this Senate this year, this one seems to me to pit hope versus fear, to pit the lessons of history against the blindness to those lessons. One Senator, who will remain nameless, this morning made the statement that free-trade arrangements arising out of fast-track proposals like this would harm not only the people of the United States, but the people of the other nations entering into such a free-trade proposition. 
Mr. President, that exhibits a blindness to what history has shown us for more than half a century. Without exception, each liberalization of trade policies on the part of the United States that had been met by a liberalization on the part of our trading partners has benefited the people of both countries. We are in an extended and significant period of economic gains today, as we speak here, in the aftermath of a series of policies carried out by administrations, both Republican and Democratic, to free trade across the entire world. The North American Free-Trade Agreement and the most recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade all reflect the increasing dependence of all of the nations of the world on trade and the fact that all can prosper from a greater degree of free trade. 
Now, Mr. President, I think it's possible to find examples in history, perhaps to find a few examples of the present day, of nations that have tried to create a sense of self-sufficiency with little, if any, foreign trade of any commodity whatsoever. When one searches out such examples, however, Mr. President, one finds, in every case, that those countries are poverty-stricken and show no particular movement out of that poverty-stricken nature. It is only when these nations free their economy and tend to free their trade policies that they begin to prosper. 
It's also possible, I suppose, to imagine a United States which, in every single commodity consumed in the country, was a more efficient producer than any of its trading partners and, therefore, would have no need for imports at all. But, of course, that doesn't happen in the real world. One's very success would create fields in which we continue that domination and other fields in which countries begin to catch up with us. 
Trade is a two-way street. Trade is a benefit not just to those who work in the trade field, but to consumers who are permitted a greater choice of higher quality goods at lower prices than would be the case if trade were restricted. That, of course, does inevitably result in losers in our economy because, as we export more, as we produce more for export, we also, as a prosperous American society, have more money to spend and often choose to purchase imported goods in some areas. 
There are many occasions on which it can be argued that there isn't a huge increase in employment resulting in freer and greater trade. But it is extremely difficult to argue the proposition that export-oriented industries, generally speaking, in the fields in which American production is most efficient and effective, whether industrial or agricultural, pays its employees far more than do those unskilled trades that are affected by foreign competition, and which jobs are more likely to be lost because someone else can do a better job than we do. 
So even if total employment is a zero-sum game, which it is not, the wages and salaries of those involved in trade-oriented occupations will be much higher than those occupied in fields that are artificially protected from foreign competition. 
Now, does that mean, Mr. President, that under any and all circumstances we should be indifferent to the antitrade activities of some of our trading partners? Certainly not. As this body knows, I have been highly critical of some of the trade policies of this administration with respect to China, with respect to Japan, and sometimes with respect to the European Community, when those policies have imposed artificial restrictions on American producers. I wish that this administration took a much stronger stance last week with respect to Chinese restrictions on our goods, given the huge nature of our bilateral trade deficit. But the fact that we can criticize the administration for not having more eloquently and more decisively supported American interests is not an argument against granting our administration the opportunity to negotiate free-trade agreements. It is, if anything, an argument for it because, without exception, Mr. President, the nations, particularly in Latin America, with whom we are likely to negotiate free-trade agreements, have greater tariffs and greater restrictions against our goods than we do against theirs at the present time. So it is clear that a reciprocal lowering of those barriers at both ends will benefit a wide range of exporting industries in the United States. 
Now, should we provide the President, at the same time, with more tools to defend American interests? We certainly should. For example, I support the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Daschle, in proposing to amend this legislation with the text of S. 219, the Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 1997. That bill would set up a system for agricultural trade identical to that used to identify violations of intellectual property rights, the special 301 procedure. The bill would require the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, annually, to designate as priority countries those trading partners having the most egregious trade barriers to American agricultural products. The USTR would then have the power to investigate those countries to determine whether countervailing measures are merited. 
My State, Mr. President, is a great producer of agricultural products for export, just as it is of intellectual properties and of aircraft. We believe in the prosperity that comes from free trade. We want that free trade to be truly free in both directions, and no power that we could grant the President is more likely to lead to that free trade in both directions than the fast-track legislation that is before us now. That legislation, Mr. President, should be passed.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford, in submitting an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1271) the Federal Aviation Administration Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1997. The bill authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] Research, Engineering, and Development [RE&D] account for fiscal year 1998. The FAA RE&D account finances projects to improve the safety, security, capacity, and efficiency of the U.S. aviation system. The authorization for the RE&D account expired at the end of September. 
Recognizing the key role that research and development efforts play in improving our Nation's aviation system, the Congress over time has strengthened the FAA RE&D program. In 1982, the Congress determined that a comprehensive research and development program was necessary to help ensure that the FAA could maintain a safe and efficient air traffic system. In 1988, the Congress established the FAA RE&D Advisory Board to help the FAA set research priorities. After the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, the Congress approved the Aviation Safety Improvement Act of 1990, which required the FAA to support activities to accelerate the research and development of new technologies to protect against terrorism. 
This bill would authorize the FAA to finance important research and development efforts. These efforts include developing new fire-resistant insulation materials for use on aircraft. Fires are a major threat to aircraft, and this new insulation is intended to give passengers additional time to evacuate if an accident occurs. The FAA also has ongoing research to develop procedures for enhancing terminal area capacity and safety. 
It is noteworthy that the FAA works with other Federal agencies and the private sector to leverage RE&D funds. The FAA, for example, has cooperative arrangements with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Department of Defense. The FAA is also currently working with more than 80 private industry partners on 15 major technology development projects. Working with private industry, for example, the FAA recently completed development of a new concrete foam material that will safely stop a large airliner that overshoots a runway because of problems during take off or landing. In addition to leveraging Federal funds, such partnerships facilitate the dissemination of research results to the private sector where they can be used to produce commercial products that will benefit the users of the U.S. aviation system. 
The bill includes a Sense of the Congress concerning the so-called Year 2000 problem as it relates to the FAA. Simply stated, the problem stems from the inability of some software to recognize the change from the year 1999 to the year 2000. In these cases, software code must be rewritten to prevent computer systems from crashing. Because the FAA has many systems, including various air traffic control systems, the bill states that the FAA should assess immediately the extent to which its systems will be affected, and to develop a plan and budget to make needed corrections. 
Funding appropriate research and development projects today can help to achieve a safer and more efficient air transportation system tomorrow. The bill that I am introducing authorizes this funding. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to give their full attention and consideration to the Aviation Competition Enhancement Act of 1997 that Senator McCain has just introduced. I would also recognize Senator McCain for his tireless efforts to address barriers to competition in the airline industry, and to provide better air service for consumers. Senator McCain has devoted much time to consideration of this issue. 
Compettion is a hallmark of our Nation, and the benefits of competition are clear. Studies show time and again that competition improves products and services, and reduces costs to consumers. When possible, the Congress should do whatever is reasonable to enhance competition. 
Airline competition has proven beneficial. Since the airline industry was deregulated, fares have fallen, and service options have increased on average across all communities. The major carriers deserve credit for responding well to competitive challenges. In addition, many of the benefits of deregulation can be attributed to the entry of so called low-fair airlines into the marketplace. The low-fare airlines have increased competition, and have enabled more people to fly than ever before. Air traffic has grown as a result, and all predictions are that it will continue to grow steadily over the next several years.. 
Although competition exists, there are also barriers to airline competition. The bill that Senator McCain has introduced today would loosen some of the anticompetitive Federal restrictions on the Nation's aviation system. These restrictions, such as slot controls and the perimeter rule at National Airport, inhibit competition. As a result, the benefits of deregulation have been limited in certain communities. 
I understand that changing the status quo by easing existing barriers is difficult. Airline businesses and services have evolved under these barriers. Airlines, airports, communities, and consumers have all grown accustomed to these barriers. This should not prevent us, however, from examining the adverse impacts of these barriers and exploring reasonable measures to remove them. 
I would also note that Senator McCain's bill would require the Department of Transportation to respond to complaints of predatory behavior on the part of major airlines within 90 days. There are numerous industry practices that warrant close scrutiny. Take for example computer reservation systems. Airline travelers usually buy tickets through travel agents, who almost always use a Computer Reservation System to determine what airline fares are available, and to make bookings. Each of the Computer Reservation Systems operating in the United States is entirely or predominately owned by one or more airlines or airline affiliates. This certainly gives these airlines and affiliates the ability to prejudice the competitive position of other airlines if not checked. Any airline that believes it is being subjected to predatory behavior deserves a timely response from the Department of Transportation. 
Again, I would urge my colleagues to take time from their busy schedules to consider Senator McCain's bill, and to provide their thoughts and insights on this important matter.

Mr. GORTON. Well, one has to assume--if you take an assumption that the gross revenues are going to be x dollars and that a royalty agreement would be 12.5 percent of x dollars, then you simply have an arithmetic calculation. There are wide differences of opinion as to the value of those tracts. For example, the demand from the State of Montana, through its junior Senator and its Congressman, were for twice this amount of money. It seems to me that there were losses to the State of Montana and that this was an appropriate transfer. I think I would have had a very different view, personally at least, toward the transfer had this transfer been from the people--that is to say, the United States of America--to some private entity. As it is, it is a transfer not to the Governor of the State of Montana, as we tend to personalize this, but to the State. It remains a limited public asset, but a public asset nevertheless. Now, this was a matter which consumed a considerable amount of time.

Mr. GORTON. In negotiations over this, it was set up, very bluntly--and I can put this on the record because it is obviously the case--so that if the President feels that is somehow or another totally unwise and doesn't mind making the government of the State of Montana unhappy, this provision is subject to a line-item veto. It was set up in that fashion. The President doesn't have to veto the whole bill or the whole $700 million in the land and water conservation fund. So if he feels it is disproportionate in some respect, we never have to go through these negotiations at all.

Mr. GORTON. Of course, the same thing is true with respect to all the other line-item vetoes, which I think would certainly be representative of millions of dollars. The President is exercising that power that was given to him by the Congress, and we will find out later whether or not they were valid. That would do no more or less than to set this out as a separate item. There is, however, a difference between the sale price of a mineral once it has been taken out and processed and worked on and the value of that same mineral while sitting in the ground. Those two are by no means equivalent.

Mr. GORTON. I will comment on that. Obviously, the regulations in these forest plans have a tremendous impact not just on the Federal Government and management of the Forest Service, but very obviously on the communities and the areas in which these forests are located. The regulations and the rules that we are talking about have been under review for 8 years; that means through two administrations. Evidently, they must be rather controversial because they seem to have been about ready to promulgate and just before the elections, both in 1992 and 1996, they were withdrawn. Now we have gone just about a year after the last election. And we have been deeply concerned that so many millions of dollars have been spent on plan revisions that may just be thrown into the wastebasket when these regulations do come out. 
So the design of this provision in the bill is to see to it that an administration, after 8 years and these two delays, comes up with final or at least interim regulations--something that it ought to be able to do within a relatively short period of time. Even so, in spite of that--and that was really what we asked them to do here in the Senate--because the administration had reservations on it, we have two exceptions to it. One is, in any forest in which a notice of intent to revise was published in the Federal Register before October 1 of this year--that is to say, where they were ready to do so; and second, where a court order has directed that a revision must occur. So in those two instances--and they are pretty big exceptions--this mandate doesn't apply at all. In the other case, all we are saying is, at least give us interim rules and regulations so that the forest plan revisions will be consistent with them when they come out.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the conference report on H.R. 2107, the fiscal year 1998 Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The conference report provides $13.8 billion for programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior subcommittee, and incorporates a number of changes to House and Senate funding levels and legislative provisions in an effort to reconcile the differences between the two bodies, and to reconcile the differences between the Congress and the administration. I firmly believe the resulting conference agreement is worthy of my colleagues' support. 
While at this time I will not go into great detail about the conference report, I want to stress the fact that the conferees on this bill have gone to extraordinary lengths to try to accommodate the concerns of the administration. I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed discussion of the modifications that have been made in response to administration concerns appear at the end of my statement.

<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. There are, however, a handful of issues in the conference agreement that I know are of great interest to all Senators. I will spend a little time discussing two of these issues: Land acquisition and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
The budget agreement provided the Appropriations Committees with the option to appropriate $700 million for `priority land acquisitions and land exchanges,' with the appropriation being in addition to the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation. This reserve fund was requested by the administration in budget talks, in large part because of the administration's desire to finance two major land purchases that it negotiated shortly before the Presidential election: The Headwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana. 
The administration originally had proposed to conduct these acquisitions administratively, exchanging oil and gas properties and revenue streams in ways that stretched existing exchange authorities to the limit, if not beyond. I and many others strongly objected to the proposed acquisitions at the time, in part because it was clear that the administration was trying to evade the requirements of the Budget Act and bypass Congress altogether on two major expenditures. In that sense, I am glad that the budget agreement provided an opportunity for these acquisitions to come before Congress, albeit not under ideal conditions. 
The House Appropriations Committee chose not to provide the $700 million. Chairman Regula not only doubted the value of the Headwaters and New World Mine acquisitions to the U.S. taxpayer, but also felt strongly that if $700 million were available in the context of the budget agreement, that money would be better spent reducing the multi-billion-dollar maintenance backlog that exists in our parks, refuges, and public lands. I cannot honestly say that I disagree with him on either point. 
I did, however, include the $700 million in the Senate bill, largely because I feel a personal commitment to the budget agreement and the broader benefits that it provides for the American taxpayer. $315 million of the funds provided in the Senate bill were for the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions. But because of the complexity of the acquisitions, the many questions that had been raised about them, and their sheer magnitude, I agreed with Senator Murkowski that the funds should be provided subject to enactment of subsequent authorizing legislation. Some have intimated that this was an attempt to kill the two deals, but I can assure you that on my part it was not. I also have no doubt that Senator Murkowski was doing anything other than his job, part of which is to authorize land purchases of this nature. The notion that Congress should simply accept the administration's word as to the worth of these expensive and highly complex projects is not only an abandonment of congressional prerogatives, but of our duty. 
Mr. President, the conference on the Interior bill was closed 3 weeks ago but for the very difficult question of land acquisition. The administration has continually insisted that the money for Headwaters and New World Mine must be included in any Interior bill that the President would sign, and that such money could not be subject to an authorizing requirement. Senator Murkowski has continued to insist on an appropriate role for the authorizing committee. Congressman Young, Congressman Hill, Congressman Riggs, and Senator Burns desired to make certain that the communities impacted by the two acquisitions were adequately compensated. Congressman Regula has insisted that a portion of the $700 million be made available to reduce maintenance backlogs on our public lands, rather than require all the money to be used to increase the public land base, and I should not fail to mention that Congressman Obey, among others, was greatly displeased that the budget resolution dictated to the penny the amount that the Appropriations Committee could provide for priority land acquisitions. 
The negotiations among all of these parties over the past several weeks have been exceedingly difficult. The compromise included in the conference report provides $699 million for priority land acquisitions and land exchanges, and critical maintenance needs. Of this amount, up to $250 million is for Headwaters Forest and up to $65 million is for the New World Mine. Authorizations for both projects are included in the conference report, but the acquisitions cannot be made until 180 days after enactment, providing the authorizing committees time to review the acquisitions and possibly recommend changes to the authorizing language. The authorizing language itself is the product of lengthy discussions between House and Senate authorizing committees, the 
Appropriations Committees and the administration. I should note that Senator Murkowski was a reluctant participant in these discussions, and feels strongly that the authorizing legislation should have gone through the normal committee process. I will also say that the administration is not in complete agreement with the provisions of the authorization. 
The major sticking point in these discussions over the last week has been the question of whether or not a formal appraisal would be required for the Headwaters and New World Mine acquisitions. The administration has insisted that appraisals are not necessary, and that Congress should be satisfied with an opinion of value--a term with no formal meaning. On the other hand, Senator Murkowski, Congressman Regula, and I all agree that a formal appraisal is the only way to safeguard the American taxpayer. While the conferees have reluctantly agreed not to cap the purchase price at the appraised value, the conference report does require an appraisal for each acquisition. 
In spite of the great strides that have been taken to address the concerns of the administration elsewhere in the bill, I have no doubt that if this bill is vetoed by the President, it will primarily be because of the appraisal requirement for these two acquisitions. I also have little doubt that if the bill is vetoed, the $700 million stands a better chance of being removed from a future bill than does the appraisal requirement. I cannot entirely account for the administration's strong resistance to the notion of a formal appraisal. If either appraisal places the value of these properties below the price to which the administration agreed, the administration will have ample opportunity to dispute the appraisal. Congress does, from time to time, approve acquisition above the appraised value. If either appraisal values one of these properties above the price to which the administration has agreed, such appraisals will only support the administration's case that these acquisitions represent good buys for the taxpayer. In short, I think Congress has been extraordinarily fair in its dealings with the administration with regard to Headwaters and New World Mine. 
Turning to the National Endowment for the Arts, my colleagues will recall that the House bill included zero funding for the NEA. The Senate bill included just over $100 million, a small increase over the current year level. The Senate also considered a number of NEA amendments during floor consideration, ranging from complete termination of the Endowment to greatly increasing the percentage of NEA funds that are provided as block grants to the States. Though the debate on these amendments made clear that there is significant concern about NEA's current structure and practices, the votes on the amendments also made clear that the Senate does not share what were apparently the views of the House. 
The conference report $98 million for NEA--a remarkable outcome given the House position. In exchange for providing nearly all the funding included in the Senate bill, the House requested that the conference report include a number of reforms to the NEA's structure and procedures. As a result, the conference report increases the percentage of block grants to States, makes arts education a priority, and alters the structure and membership of the National Council for the Arts to reflect congressional interest in the NEA's conduct and direction. 
With regard to the conference agreement on the NEA, it is safe to say that the House leadership is not pleased with the result. I think it is also safe to say that if this bill is vetoed and returned to conference, it is almost certain that the House will demand additional reductions in funding for the NEA. This is not a threat from an opponent of the Endowment. To the contrary, I have been a strong supporter of the NEA, even though I have been critical of some of the decisions made by the agency over the years. My comments are rather a simple recognition of current sentiment in Congress. 
In a similar vein, I cannot say what would happen to the $700 million for land acquisition should this bill be vetoed. This comes not from someone who strictly opposes providing the $700 million, but rather from someone who included the money in this bill in the first place. I am simply stating the fact that this conference agreement is very delicately balanced, and that a decision by the administration to come back for one more bite at the apple--despite the great lengths we have gone to accommodate its concerns--will not be without peril. 
On a less ominous note, I do want to take a brief moment to mention a few other items. First, I want to note the work that Senator Jeffords and Senator Torricelli have done in the interests of the preservation of Civil War battlefields--a subject near and dear to my heart. The Senators offered an amendment to this bill expressing the sense of the Senate that Civil War battlefield preservation should be a high priority for Congress. I know they would like to have done more, particularly with regard to earmarking a portion of the $700 million, but I do want them to know that I will continue to work with them in the allocation of the $700 million should this conference report be enacted. I also want to note some of the Civil War projects that are funded elsewhere in this bill, such as the $1.7 million provided for rehabilitation at Vicksburg National Military Park, the $2 million provided for stabilization work at Shiloh National Military Park, the $1 million provided for an interpretive center at Corinth battlefield, and the $3.5 million provided for land acquisition at Fredricksburg/Spotsylvania National Military Park. I am also very pleased that the conference report provides a more than $1 million operating increase for Gettysburg National Military Park, a subject on which Senator Santorum has worked very diligently. 
I also want to clarify that the funding provided to the Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat conservation planning for the Preble's Meadow jumping mouse applies to four counties in Colorado. These mice range over four counties in Colorado and two counties in Wyoming. However, the mice occur on private lands in Colorado and on Federal land in Wyoming. The habitat conservation plan only applies to the private lands in Colorado. 
Finally, I want to make special note that this bill includes funding for the National Park Service to study alternatives for the commemoration and interpretation of events associated with the integration of the Charleston School District in Arkansas and Central High School in Little Rock. While other Senators are familiar with the events surrounding the integration of Central High School in 1957, they may not be aware that the Charleston public schools were actually the first to integrate in Arkansas--by some accounts the first in the South--shortly after the Brown versus Board of Education decision in 1954. My colleagues may also not be aware that Senator Bumpers is a former member of the Charleston School Board, and that he was counsel to the school board during the period in which the decision was made to integrate the Charleston schools. Perhaps the relatively smooth integration of the Charleston schools, as compared to the bitter struggle that took place at Central High School, is a most telling testament to Senator Bumpers' wisdom and power of persuasion--qualities that we will sorely miss after his departure from the Senate. 
With that I will once again express my thanks to Senator Byrd for all his help and guidance over the course of the year, and express my sincere hope that the President will sign this bill. I cannot stress too greatly the length to which we have gone to address the administration's concerns, nor can I overstate the delicacy of the balance that has been achieved in this conference report. Nothing good can come of the President vetoing this bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the historic achievements of Liz Heaston of Richland, WA. Last Saturday, Liz became the first woman to play in a college football game. Her performance as place kicker for the Willamette University football team resulted in kicking two extra points in a victorious effort against Linfield College. This event also strikes a special chord for me because Liz is the daughter of Suzanne Heaston, a member of my State staff in Richland, WA. 
What is equally amazing about this young woman's accomplishments last Saturday is that her feat was accomplished after playing a full soccer game, where she is the star defender on the Willamette University women's soccer team, ranked 14th nationally in the NAIA. It was Liz's tremendous abilities on the soccer field which led the Willamette football coaching staff to recruit Liz onto the football field. 
While Liz may not have a future football career ahead of her, Saturday's milestone sets a tremendous precedent for future trailblazers in womens sports. The athletic accomplishments of Liz Heaston, both in soccer and football, reinforce the role sports can play in helping our daughters discover and realize their potential both on and off the athletic field. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my remarks are directed at the two distinguished managers of the bill, and I hope they will be able to respond to the concerns I am about to raise. 
On July 22, while this bill was being debated on the floor of the Senate, I shared with the Members of the Senate a series of scandals across Indian country with respect to a housing program for low-income Indian reservation residents. The scandal occurred in my own State in Washington in the construction of a 5,000 square foot, $400,000 home under this low-income program for the chairman of the housing council of the particular tribe, and similar activities in other reservations across the country in which money had been misused not for the benefit of low-income Indians on 
reservations but for the benefit of the people who were managing the money themselves, most of whom were above average in income. 
As a result of that set of facts, themselves a result of a long investigation on the part of the Seattle Times, the Senate unanimously passed an amendment that says `The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall bar any person from participating in any activity under the native American housing block grants program under title I of the Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1996 or any activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban Development where such person has substantially, significantly, or materially violated the requirements of any such activity. The Secretary shall pursue reimbursement for any losses or costs associated with these violations.' 
Now, Mr. President, the two managers were delighted to accept that amendment. The Senator from Missouri told me a week or so ago that the House was greatly resistant to these provisions and that he greatly feared he would have to drop them. In fact, he has done so, Mr. President. I simply would like to get his explanation as to why Members of the House of Representatives seem to feel that someone can `substantially, significantly, and materially violate the requirements of the law' and suffer no consequences for doing so? 
This seems to me to be a ratification of this widespread fraud. At least two people working for the Department of Housing and Urban Development were transferred, another has been forced into early retirement as a result. But why is it that a simple prohibition against what amounts to total fraud--effectively stealing not just the money of the people of the United States, but of poor members of these tribes, now is suddenly dropped from the bill? 
What sanction contained in this amendment was regarded as so obnoxious by Members of the House of Representatives, I ask my distinguished friend and chairman, that they refused to include it in the final bill?

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate those expressions on the part of my friend from Missouri and I emphasize that I know he supported this provision and that he did his best to keep it included in the bill. 
I hope that at some future time in authorizing legislation or otherwise we will be able to do something similar to this. I, too, have heard the assurances of the Department of Housing and Urban Development that this will not happen again, but we have gotten those assurances in the past without them having been carried out. 
I summarize by saying how anyone could say that a person who `has substantially, significantly, or materially violated the requirements' of this law should somehow or another not even receive so much as a tap on the wrist and should be allowed to go on doing in the future what that person has done in the past, is beyond my understanding. I am sorry this is not in the bill. I don't think the excuses of its opponents and the House conferees are adequate in the slightest, but I do know that the chairman and the ranking minority member sympathize with me on this and will support us as we continue on a crusade for honesty and straightforward dealing and using this money for the purposes for which it was intended. I know they will support that in the future.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in 1974, impelled by certain individuals and groups who felt that too much money was being spent on political campaigns and on political speech, the Congress of the United States passed a law limiting the amount of money that a candidate for Federal office could receive from any individual source, and limiting the amount of money that a candidate for a Federal office could spend advocating his or her election to that office. 
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the half of that statute that limited the amount of money that a candidate could seek from any given individual or organization or group; but about the proposition that a candidate could be limited in the amount of money that he or she could spend on a campaign, the Supreme Court of the United States made this statement--and I quote 
A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money. The distribution of the humblest handbill or leaflet entails printing, paper and circulation costs. Speeches and rallies generally necessitate hiring a hall and publicizing the event. The electorate's increasing dependence on television, radio, and other mass media for news and information has made these expensive modes of communication indispensable instruments of effective political speech. Being free to engage in unlimited political expression subject to a ceiling on expenditures is like being free to drive an automobile as far and as often as one desires on a single tank of gasoline. 
And the Supreme Court of the United States found invalid, as a violation of the fundamental first amendment right of free expression, any such limitation. 
The same mindset that gave us those laws and that has forced those individuals or groups who feel vitally interested in the election or defeat of a candidate to spend money in other ways, often through the political parties that sponsor those candidates, now has brought this McCain-Feingold bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Finding it ineffective simply to limit the amount of money that candidates can collect from a given individual, the bill now seeks to limit severely the amount of money that political parties can collect with which to express their message to the American people. The fact that this flies in the face of most thoughtful academics observing the political scene in the United States who call for greater party responsibility and a greater role for political parties to play in order to create a greater degree of responsibility and responsiveness in carrying out the will of the people as expressed in elections, the McCain-Feingold bill seeks to tie the hands of parties and to render them largely ineffective. 
The sponsors of the bill do recognize, however, that there are 
other methods of communicating political ideas. While they did not attempt to limit the right of other individuals or organizations in communicating their ideas directly, and in some cases not at all, they do attempt, as the Senator from Kentucky has just pointed out, to take a form of communication called issue advocacy--that is to say, making your views known to the people of the United States with respect to issues that come before the Congress of the United States--and force it into a category which they define as express advocacy, essentially whenever the name of a candidate or a Government officeholder is used, and once again provide limitations on the amount of money that can be collected for the expression of that form of advocacy. 
As the Senator from Kentucky has so clearly pointed out, not only is that portion of the McCain-Feingold bill unconstitutional on the basis of a long line of Supreme Court decisions, its unconstitutionality was reaffirmed this morning, this very morning by the refusal of the Supreme Court even to listen to a challenge to a first circuit decision on exactly that subject. 
So what we have in McCain-Feingold is, in addition to the limitation on the amount of money that can be spent or contributed to individual candidates, an additional limitation on the amount that can be contributed to political parties, but no limitation at all on the amount of money that can be spent independently of those political parties by the widest range of groups and individuals in the United States who have a vital interest in the actions of this Congress unless those groups make a mistake which is absolutely unnecessary to make and use one of a handful of magic words. 
Finally, of course, McCain-Feingold does not attempt in any respect whatsoever to limit the commentary, either in news columns or on editorial pages, on the part of the newspapers in the United States or similar commentary on radio and television stations. It isn't long, however, since exactly such a set of potential restrictions were proposed. 
With a degree of intellectual honesty, absent from this debate, in February and March of this year many of those who are here today promoting the McCain-Feingold bill recognized that the goals they sought were blatantly violative of the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States and proposed to amend the first amendment. 
At this point, Mr. President, I think it not at all inappropriate once again to read into the Record what those Senators--I think some 30-plus of them altogether in the final vote--proposed to do to the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. They proposed to say:  
Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a candidate for nomination for election to, or for election to, Federal office. 
It seems clear to me, Mr. President, that that constitutional amendment, were it placed in the Constitution of the United States, would have permitted Congress to state that the New York Times, or a newspaper in a city of 50,000 people in a city in Kentucky, could have its commentary on election campaigns limited in the same way that the present law limits contributions to candidates today. 
Now, Mr. President, I think a newspaper--I will take one of my own--say the Tri City Herald in central Washington, with a circulation of some 40,000 newspapers a day, if it writes an editorial in favor of my candidacy, which I am pleased to say that it has, and distributes 40,000 copies of that newspaper, it has exceeded that $1,000 campaign contribution limit if the cost of writing and printing and distributing that newspaper exceeded 2.5 cents a copy. 
Lord knows by how much the New York Times would exceed that contribution by making any kind of commentary on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate for political office. Lord knows how much more such a commentary on network television news could be considered to be worth. 
Yet, Mr. President, at least the proponents of that constitutional amendment were being intellectually honest and at least they were being consistent, or would have been consistent had they been willing to say they wanted to limit the way newspapers and radio stations and television stations could comment on politics, because, obviously, if every other form of communication is going to be limited, how in the world can we justify letting those few people in the United States with enough money to own the newspapers or having the good fortune to be on their editorial boards and, for that matter, to write news stories about politics not be limited? Of course they should. 
But, Mr. President, the first amendment was written not when we had television or radio stations, but when we had thousands of newspapers in the United States of America, most of them speaking much more sharply about candidates and issues than do newspapers today. And the men who wrote the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States knew that every one of those newspaper publishers had a greater first amendment right by the definition used by the promoters of McCain-Feingold than did the average citizen who did not own or write for a newspaper. 
But they consider that right of mass communication about political ideas to be a fundamental liberty of the people of the United States. Now we have opponents of this bill who say it is not only not a fundamental liberty of the United States; it is such a great evil that we need effectively to muzzle them. 
Hark back to the Supreme Court in which the Supreme Court says virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society require the expenditure of money. We have proponents who say we should not allow the expenditure of money in amounts that are sufficient to communicate those ideas. 
Having limited the amount of money candidates can get, they now wish to limit the amount of money political parties can get. It is clear they wish to limit the amount of money that these independent groups can get, but in the absence of their constitutional amendment, they can't do that. 
Now, last year, Mr. President, I asked this question: Were the expenditures of candidates or of political parties or of third party interest groups the least responsible? The answer, obviously, is the latter. A candidate whose name must go on all political communications can be immediately called to account for falsehood and, in fact, can readily be called to account even for what is considered to be an unfair characterization of his or her own candidacy or an unfair criticism of an opponent. Expenditures by political parties don't carry that same degree of responsibility. The occupant of the chair at the present time is not really responsible for the communications of the Kansas State Republican Party, nor am I in my political party in my State. We will catch a certain degree of criticism for what our parties do, but we at least have plausible deniability. But now having forced even the parties out of the field of effective communication, we leave all political communication to the newspapers and the television stations and those organizations, whether they are of the left or the right or of a narrow special interest, almost wholly to the field of unregulated communication for which neither beneficiaries have any responsibility nor the victims any effective way of responding. 
The Senator from Oregon, during the course of this debate, has pointed out the impact of a law very much like the one that we are discussing here on politics in Oregon. There the limitations on contributions for candidates were even tighter. The point that he made of what happens in the real world was the candidates can't raise very much money, the political parties are fairly weak, so campaigning became more negative than it had ever been before--not only more negative because of the use of the undocumented constitutional rights of these outside groups to criticize, but from the fact that almost all of their communication was critical and negative in nature, and the limitations on the candidates made it effectively impossible for them to answer. 
My own State, Mr. President, is going through pretty much the same experience. The more the limitations on the candidates, the greater the expenditure of money independently in so-called issue advocacy will be, and the more negative political communication will be, as it was in the classic example of the tens of millions of dollars spent by the labor unions in 1995 and in 1996. 
Now, Mr. President, one other point, and I will have to admit, along with everyone else who has spoken today, almost everything that has been said today has been with respect to the revised McCain-Feingold bill. The issue before the Senate, however, is the Lott-Nickles amendment. The same analysis does not attain to the Lott-Nickles amendment because it simply says that labor unions and labor union-type organizations, while they remain entirely unlimited in the way in which they can spend their money, and with respect to issue advocacy, can only be involved in politics by the use of money to the extent that there are members who have paid dues into those unions who allow their money to be spent in such a fashion. 
It is curious in the mind of this Senator that such an obviously just policy--not allowing my money, your money or 
anyone else's money to be used to communicate ideas with which you or I or that third party disagrees, a proposition that is clearly constitutional--should be considered to be a poison pill or the death knell for campaign reform. What could be more fundamental, Mr. President, than the idea that the individual whose money is being spent in connection with the communication of political ideas should have some control over how that money is spent? 
Now, Mr. President, I am in a position to tell you how that works in practice because another element of one of the latest of the campaign reforms in the State of Washington was to make just such a provision. When that provision became law, 80 percent or more of the members of the Washington Education Association, the teacher's union, refused to allow their money to be used in politics at all. I have just heard, though I can't be entirely certain of this statistic with respect to other labor unions, the percentage of members who are willing to permit their money to be used is in single digits. Presumably, the members of those organizations prefer their money to be used for the primary function of a union with collective bargaining rights and not even on politics with which they agree, much less politics with which they disagree. 
That, Mr. President, is the reason the opposition to this amendment is so fierce. That is the reason we are told most of the proponents of McCain-Feingold will filibuster this very bill if it is included. It is just because the opposition on the part of members of these organizations to spending their money in the way in which it has been spent over the last several years is so deep, so broad, and so fierce. 
But in this case, I want to state once again, Mr. President, we are not talking about a matter over which there could be any serious constitutional challenge at all. We are simply talking about whether or not it is good policy. We are talking about something that would meet the goals of McCain-Feingold to the extent that their goals are to limit the amount of money being spent on political speech. It would certainly limit it in connection with the last campaign. 
Now, I am not convinced of the case that we are spending too much money on political speech. I believe the wide diffusion of political ideas was exactly what the first Congress of the United States had in mind when it passed the first amendment. However, if you are going to limit political speech, you ought to do so fairly and across the board. To do so fairly and across the board, you must gut the first amendment to the United States, you must change the Constitution, and you must say we are going to have Government--Members of this body and the appointed Federal Election Commission--decide what speech in the political context is legitimate and what speech is not, and the definition of that challenge is its own death knell because, defined in that fashion, there aren't 5 percent of the American people who would agree. 
We have before the Senate, Mr. President, a flawed bill with a flawed and unconstitutional goal, together with the breathtaking statement that should we make the fundamental requirement that a man or woman's money not be spent on politics with which he or she disagrees, that we are killing this flawed proposal. 
Well, I don't think the bill becomes any more constitutional by the adoption of the Lott-Nickles amendment. I don't believe the obvious constitutional flaws reiterated once again today by the Supreme Court of the United States are improved by it. Abstract fairness probably is. But a bill that says that there is something wrong with the communication of ideas--the last Democratic speaker criticized the way in which campaigns were conducted, apparently feeling that maybe we ought to have a governmental entity that says what an individual says in a political campaign is fair or unfair. We have created the greatest and strongest democracy in history and the greatest debate over political ideas with the first amendment as it is. I, for one, believe we ought to leave it alone.

Mr. GORTON. It would certainly increase the price of television stations and television networks. It would be a bonanza to those corporate owners, as any other corporation that had a political agenda would find the only way it could effectively communicate its ideas would be through the ownership of a television network or a major metropolitan newspaper and the like. 
But the point made by the Senator from Kentucky is a most interesting one. Westinghouse and Disney and GE don't need to give soft money to parties, do they? They don't need to come up with their political ideas indirectly. They have the ability to communicate them directly, without control, without limitation as to amount, to the people of the United States. So the Senator from Kentucky has made my own point better than I did myself. If you are going to limit political speech effectively, you are going to have to limit everyone's political speech. And the fewer the exemptions from those limitations, the more valuable those unlimited mouthpieces are because they cannot effectively be countered, except by someone else with the exemption. 
I want to repeat one more time that I believe the constitutional amendment that was seriously debated, but defeated, on the floor of this Senate in March would have permitted limitations on what those television networks could have done, what the New York Times and every newspaper in the United States could have done. And it is the very fact that that constitutional amendment would have allowed such limitations that is the reason it should not have gotten one-third of the votes of the Members of this body. It should not have gotten any at all. 
Once, however, you determine that we should continue the more than 200 years of unrestricted freedom on the part of the mass media, it becomes increasingly difficult to justify the proposition that we should limit the ability to communicate of everyone else. 
As the Supreme Court decided more than 20 years ago, the ability to use money and to use, in turn, the mass media is at the very heart of the first amendment rights. The Senator from Nebraska, who was here before, it seemed to me, had the appropriate answer to this question. Political contributions should be freely given, not coerced. They should be immediately publicized and made available. Those who violate those laws of disclosure ought to be appropriately punished. None of these elements is a part of the law today, and that is where reform ought to start.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, yesterday, President Clinton assailed my proposal to give more money to schools all across the country and restore authority for directing those funds to parents and teachers and school board members. The debate about the future of our public schools is vitally important to the future of this country. A front-page Washington Post article today notes: `. . .more parents than ever are choosing alternatives to public education for their children. . .' and are doing so in such great numbers that the phenomenon is starting to resemble a revolution. We should read this as a warning signal that parents are beginning to lose faith in their public schools. We must act decisively to restore that faith, improve education, and prepare our children for their future. More of what we are doing now is not enough. 
On one point, the President and I do agree: We can improve public education. We part company, however, on who can best make decisions to improve our public schools. I believe that parents and teachers and local school board officials will make the greatest strides in improving education because they are in our homes and classrooms and high schools with our kids. But with his remarks yesterday, President Clinton says to parents and teachers: I don't trust you. 
I find it remarkable that the President believes that restoring decisionmaking authority to parents and teachers and our elected school board members is somehow dangerous. The Gorton education reform amendment increases the amount of money school districts have to work with, thus, expanding the programs they can target to both disadvantaged and high-achieving students. 
A recent study found that if Federal education funds for kindergarten through high school are sent directly to school districts, as the Gorton education reform amendment proposes, school districts would receive an additional $670 million. Why would they receive more? Because the funds would bypass the Department of Education and State educational bureaucracies and save that amount in administrative application and compliance costs. Washington State school districts would receive $12.5 million more to target to their most needy students; Arkansas schools would receive $7 million in increased education funds; Mississippi would get $9 million to target disadvantaged students and other school programs. 
President Clinton and opponents of giving parents and teachers a larger role in our children's education presume that local school districts will act irresponsibly if Federal strings disappear. This adds insult to injury. How can the President say with a straight face that programs would be `abolished' just because a bureaucrat does not direct them? Those who share the schools and classrooms with our children every day are not going to squander an opportunity to use an increase in Federal funds to address the problems they see every day. 
It is also extremely disingenuous to state that my proposal would somehow `close the Department of Education,' as President Clinton suggested yesterday. Higher education and dozens of functions relating to education in general will remain in the Department--perhaps too many such functions--but hundreds of bureaucrats who now write rules and regulations to inflict on every school in America will go, and their salaries will be used to hire new teachers and provide better education in every school in our Nation. 
Just on Sunday, Madam President, the Columbus Dispatch, in an editorial, summarized the dispute in this fashion: 
It's hard to see what the U.S. Department of Education has accomplished in its 20 years of existence to improve this country's system of schooling. The Senate's block grant approach is worth a try. 
The will to change and improve our public school system and restore parents' faith in the quality of education it can provide to our kids is there. It is at home in our cities and towns and communities. Will we untie parents' and teachers' hands and let them do their jobs? The biggest point I believe today's Washington Post article makes clear is that parents are not turning to the Federal Government to improve their kids' education--parents and teachers are coming up with alternative solutions because they want the best possible education for their kids. 
We must return and restore more freedom, not less, to our local schools, so that we can restore the public's faith in public education.

Mr. GORTON. I rise for a brief colloquy with, the manager of the bill. Mr. President, section 104 of the continuing resolution states that no funds available or authority granted shall be used to initiate or resume any project or activity for which appropriations, funds, or other authority were not available during fiscal year 1997. As the chairman knows, the fiscal year 1997 interior--or is it Omnibus--appropriations bill included language which prohibited the use of appropriated funds to review or modify sourcing areas previously approved under the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief Act [FRCSRA] of 1990. The fiscal year 1997 language goes on to further prohibit the use of funds to enforce or implement Forest Service regulations for this act that were issued on September 8, 1995. As the chairman is also aware, I have included language in the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill that clarifies FRCSRA. Am I correct in my interpretation of the continuing resolution, that the provisions related to FRCSRA in fiscal year 1997 are extended for the duration of this CR?

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report, which this body may consider as early as tomorrow, is a provision that encourages the Corps of Engineers to make a decision on permits for a 50-foot dock extension at the Port of Seattle. 
Over the past several years the Port of Seattle, Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, and Corps of Engineers have been involved in a debate over the replacement of a 350-foot wood dock with a 400-foot concrete dock at the Port of Seattle. In an effort to move this process forward and break the deadlock between the parties, I included report language in the Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report asking the Corps of Engineers promptly to consider the permit issue. 
Due to the continued cooperation and hard work of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and Port of Seattle, an agreement was reached this past Friday evening over the dock extension. I would like to praise the judgment and cooperation of the Port of Seattle and the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe both. Their willingness to work together has not only averted a protracted conflict but also provide a positive example for other local governments and tribal governments in reaching agreements under similar circumstances. 
As a result of this agreement, the language which I included in the Energy and Water Appropriation Conference Report is redundant and no longer necessary. I have discussed this point with Congressman Norm Dicks in the House and would like the official record to show that both the House and Senate agree that this language is effectively voided by the agreement. Furthermore, I would like to request that the final version of the Energy and Water Conference Report that will be considered by the Senate not contain this language. In any event, that language should be treated as having no effect.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, many of the constitutional questions that are debated here today in the context of the validity of this bill have already been debated this year in a more open and more refreshing manner. When those who propose to limit free speech on political issues had the courage to propose an amendment that would restrict the first amendment right of free speech on political issues, while they were, in my view, entirely wrong, while they proposed a disaster to the most fundamental basis of free government, they at least had the intellectual integrity and consistency to recognize that what they wanted to do was inconsistent with the first amendment as it has existed from the time of the first Congress until this day. 
Now they produce a bill with two fundamental flaws. In most respects--many at least--it is clearly unconstitutional and, in every other respect, it is bad policy. I think I would like to make a few remarks about the way in which political debates are conducted in this country surrounding election campaigns. I will try to deal a little bit about the way the McCain-Feingold bill treats these various communications. And perhaps I will elicit a few additional remarks from my friend from Kentucky in doing so. 
In 1974, when the present campaign finance law was passed--with the support, I may say, of just those people and organizations and newspapers that now find how great a failure that 1974 law was and, like the drunk waking up the morning after with a hangover, prescribed the hair of the dog that bit them--their focus was on candidates, on the source of money for candidates to express their ideas through the mass media. In that focus, they prohibited a wide range of sources of money and greatly limited other sources of money, so that a candidate may not take more than $1,000 per election from an individual, or more than $5,000 from a political action committee, an organization that was created, in effect, by that 1974 law. So they placed severe limits on the one kind of political debate for which each candidate is totally responsible. No candidate can avoid responsibility for what he or she says in public, in print, or on television. This forum of advocacy is now subject to severe limits as a result of the 1974 law. 
Now, it is interesting to note that much of the support for the kind of bill or the kind of ideas that are reflected in McCain-Feingold, the kind of ideas that have just been presented by the Senator from New Jersey, stem from the fact that mass campaigning costs money, the money has to be raised by individual candidates, and the candidates don't like to spend the time raising money that the 1974 law requires. So we are told that the candidates ought to be supported by a subsidy from the Federal Government or a subsidy from the private sector 
in the form of noncompetitive prices for television advertising. 
Mr. President, I can certainly sympathize with the views of those who do not like raising money for their own candidacy. I couldn't possibly claim that I do myself. But to exactly the extent that it takes candidates too long to do so is a direct result of the reforms of 1974. And this reform in McCain-Feingold will make that situation far worse because the limitation on sources for candidates are tightened. So candidates, in order to get their own message out, will have to spend more time raising money. 
As an incidental, I think it is not at all unhealthy that we who have this rather exalted status as U.S. Senators should be forced to go hat in hand to our constituents and to others interested in the political process and show a little bit of humility and ask for that support. Many of the supporters of reform feel that that is somehow demeaning, and that the Government ought to come up with the money that they use to engage in their candidacies. Personally, Mr. President, I think they might just as well advocate lifetime terms for Senators. Certainly no one would be subject to pressures from campaign contributors under those circumstances. But the very mention of that process simply shows that an attempt to avoid responsibility is an attempt to avoid responsibility, whether it is called lifetime terms and avoiding democracy entirely, or whether it simply comes in the guise of saying that the Government ought to pay for these campaigns. 
In any event, Mr. President, the first defect, though perhaps not an unconstitutional defect, of this bill is that it takes the very set of rules that have created the demand for more rules for indirect spending and makes them worse. It takes 
the very criticism of the time candidates spend raising money and requires them to spend more time making money, and does it in the one area in which the candidate can be called to order, can be held responsible by his or her constituents: that is to say, spending directly by a candidate on his or her own campaign. 
The immediate result of a restriction of this first form of free speech--that on the part of candidates--was to push those who are vitally interested in the decisions that we and other candidates across the country make with respect to public policy away from supporting candidates into supporting political parties. 
Most academics over the course of the last 30 or 40 years have decried the decline of political party discipline and accountability, and have said that one of the shortcomings of American democracy is that parties don't mean very much; that they have very little political influence even over the candidates who are elected using the party name, and have called for methods of creating a greater degree of cohesion and party responsibility. Yet, when the two major political parties have discovered a method of raising money and are advocating directly or indirectly the election of candidates carrying their name, that very system is now considered by the reformers to be such a terrible tragedy as to cause the introduction of a bill that will make it practically impossible for either major political party to raise sufficient amounts of money, either to call for a certain degree of responsibility on the part of its candidates, or to get its message across to the American people. 
I think I do agree, I say, Mr. President, to my friend from Kentucky, that that portion of constitutional opinion of the 126 
scholars, or whatever the number was that he mentioned, with respect to limiting contributions to political parties, is probably correct. I seriously doubt a form of contribution can be prohibited. But on the basis that contributions to candidates can be limited, contributions to the parties can probably be limited. It doesn't make it a desirable course of action. It makes it a highly undesirable course of action.

Mr. GORTON. The answer to that from my perspective, as the perspective from the Senator from Kentucky is, of course, it is not. Of course, it is highly undesirable. It will atomize the political system. It will make Members far more free than they have been even in the past from any loyalty as a party, and thus 
reduce the ability of a Congress or of any other body to reach coherent decisions, but, more importantly than that, will reduce the ability to communicate a coherent set of political ideas to the people of the United States in connection with election campaigns. That is why it is so tremendously undesirable. Even if I am correct that it is constitutional to create such limits, they certainly violate the spirit of the first amendment which is designed to create a field in which the widest range of political ideas can be communicated in the broadest possible fashion. 
However, when we get to the third way in which money can be spent to communicate political ideas, I find myself in total agreement with the Senator from Kentucky. That has to do with direct expenditures on advocating the election or the defeat of candidates by persons unconnected with political parties. 
Before I get to that, we started with the fact that money that is given to and spent by candidates certainly carries with it a huge responsibility. Candidates cannot avoid responsibility for what their political ideas are that they express with their moneys they spend on their own campaigns. They get a degree of protection from their own political party when it spends money. They can say `No, that really wasn't quite right. I didn't really believe in that attack on my opponent.' It is hard to shed that responsibility completely because each candidate has chosen a political party, and its political party's name appears beside his or her name on the ballot. But the responsibility of a candidate is only indirect. 
In other words, the party's advertisements, the party's communications bluntly can be less responsible than the candidate's own expressions. The candidate has a certain degree 
of invulnerability from any such irresponsibility. 
But, by definition, when another group, or another wealthy individual, decides that the election, or the defeat of a candidate, is important enough to want to spend a significant amount of money on it and engages in that activity without consulting the candidate or the party, that communication beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt is protected by the first amendment--beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt. 
This complex and Byzantine form of regulation in the present law, which would be made more complex and more Byzantine by the passage of McCain-Feingold, raises this question of whether or not expenditures are actually independent, and creates a bonanza for lawyers and for accusations. But it doesn't need to exist in an intelligent system. But clearly when those expenditures are independent, they can advocate the election, or the defeat of a candidate, with entire impunity. They are protected by the first amendment. They ought to be protected by the first amendment. They will continue to be protected until we repeal, or modify, that first amendment, and decide that we ought to choke off free speech on political ideas. 
Well, obviously, the candidate who benefits from these independent expenditures has absolutely no responsibility for them whatsoever. However scurrilous or inaccurate they may be, they are not the candidate's fault. They are independent of the candidate. The organization of the individual who was presenting them or paying for them and does not appear on the ballot can't effectively be held responsible in a political sense for that form of communication. 
So, first, in 1974 we forced expenditures from the most 
responsible use to a less responsible use. Now, if we pass McCain-Feingold, we force them into an entirely irresponsible channel, even when we are dealing directly with the election or the defeat of candidates. But, Mr. President, the real point is we cannot stop the money from being spent. 
The decisions made by the Congress are vitally important to people's lives, and the people whose lives are affected by them are going to try to affect elections for membership in this body and in the House of Representatives. Obviously, they have to have that right in a free society. 
Well, then we move on to the fourth method of communicating ideas. That goes to the benefit of this debate under the title of `issue advocacy.' Again, any individual, any group, has a total complete protected right to communicate ideas or views about political ideas. Again, these reforms create this totally artificial lawyer-enriching distinction between an independent expenditure on behalf of a candidate and issue advocacy, an issue different but a distinction in the real world, but one that suddenly becomes very important when you want to get Government involved in all of these ideas. 
Were the advertisements by the AFL-CIO all through the last election campaign that said, `Tell Congressman X to stop destroying Medicare' issue advocacy? That is what the AFL-CIO claims. In fact, of course, they were designed to defeat candidate X in the next election. 
Mr. President, let us be absolutely certain that the AFL-CIO and every other organization has a perfectly totally protected constitutional right to engage in that activity, and to engage in independent expenditures directly at the same time. 
That is a separate question as to whether or not we ought to require a labor union, or any other voluntary organization organized primarily for one purpose, to not spend the money of its members on an entirely different political purpose without their consent. 
Clearly, we can require that consent in any reasonable way which we propose, but once that consent is granted, the constitutional right is absolute. 
Then, fifth, Mr. President--and the Senator from Kentucky outlined this question I thought with great simplicity and clarity and elegance a couple of hours ago--fifth, of course, we have the newspapers and the television and radio stations, the forms of mass communication in this society which enter into this struggle gleefully, at great length, continuously and totally protected by the first amendment. 
We on this side of the aisle can complain about the fact that most of the major metropolitan newspapers, editorial writers and their reporters are biased to the left, but none of us for a moment claim the right to control their speech or to say that they can't write editorials or that we have the right to say their news stories are biased and keep them out of the newspapers or out of television stations. 
I must say, and I trust that the Senator from Kentucky will agree with me, when we use this pejorative `special interest,' these newspaper editorial writers do have a special interest in restricting all other forms of free speech about politics so that they can occupy the field alone or almost alone and greatly increase their influence over the actions of the voting public.

Mr. GORTON. There is little question but that that would be the result. In fact with my own views on where the constitutional line is likely to be drawn, it seems to me that would be almost the inevitable result of the passage of McCain-Feingold. Its restrictions on money to political parties might well be upheld, probably would be upheld at least in part. It is possible that they would be upheld in their entirety. Their other restrictions will inevitably be found to be unconstitutional. 
So we have now restricted the candidate's ability to communicate his or her ideas. We have restricted the political 
party's ability to reflect their ideas and the ideas of their candidates, the Democratic Party as much as the Republican Party. But because, at least as politics are constituted today, those additional interests, especially organized labor, are primarily on the Democratic side, we have enhanced their ability to communicate, or we have increased their competitive ability to communicate. Let's put it in that fashion. More of the airwaves, more of the mass media will reflect their views. For that reason, because of the general bias of most newspapers and their reporters and their editorial writers and television commentators, Republican candidates historically depend far more on their own ability to raise money and the ability of their party to raise money than have candidates on the other side. 
But there is a risk. The law of unintended consequences could easily result in a few years in a reversal of that situation, and the benefits of the spending might very well end up on this side of the aisle. Certainly the unintended consequences of 1974 are exactly what we are dealing with here today. 
My focus, however, is on the fact of responsibility. It is appropriate for voters to hold candidates responsible for the ideas that they communicate. It is reasonably appropriate for them to hold political parties responsible. But they cannot hold candidates responsible for a form of communication over which the candidates have absolutely no control. So negative campaigning, it seems to me, will increase rather than decrease with the passage of this bill. Irresponsible charges, unprovable charges, false charges will increase rather than decrease if we should pass this proposal. 
But the fundamental point is the amount of money in the 
political system will not decrease at all because those who feel vitally affected by what happens in politically elected bodies will find a way to spend that money, will be protected by the Constitution in their spending of that money, and will just do it in less responsible channels than they do today. 
That, it seems to me, is the policy argument against this proposal. In fact, if we want to make campaigns more candidate oriented and more issue oriented, we would at the very least raise the limitation on contributions to candidates to the level at which they were in 1974 by reflecting the ravages of inflation since then, and we would encourage contributions to political parties. What we would do--I am certain that the Senator from Kentucky agrees with me--is we would see to it the source of those funds is reported contemporaneously and prominently. The immense amount of time and effort and money that is being spent on investigating the Democratic National Committee and the Presidential election of 1996 would, I am certain, have been absolutely unnecessary had all of these contributions and all of their sources and all of these activities been public knowledge at the time at which they were given, the time at which those actions were taken. Why? Because it would not have happened that way.

Mr. GORTON. As it was they could take the money and avoid the heat. 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his courage in this matter and the clarity with which he speaks on it. We simply cannot, consistently with the Constitution of the United States, limit political speech. We can only limit responsible political speech. We can only force money from responsible challenges into less responsible ones. We can only increase the power of the press, the very group that is most anxious to limit speech by others than its own members, and/or do what some proposed to do just a few months ago, say the first amendment doesn't work anymore and we better change it. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, that may have been, as it was, terrible policy, but it was at least intellectually honest. To present us with an unconstitutional bill is neither. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to outline certain changes to my amendment that was accepted as part of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Act as passed by the Senate. These changes will be submitted to the House-Senate conference committee. My amendment, No. 1122, would block grant funds from several K-12 education programs in the Department of Education and send those funds directly to school districts. These changes have been incorporated into a new draft of the amendment. 
The genesis of the changes is a series of discussions with my colleagues in the Senate and other interested parties. While these changes correct minor drafting errors, they do so without changing the overall philosophy of the amendment. The most significant of the changes exclude from the block grant entirely any funds from the Adult Education, Vocational Education, and Rehabilitation Services programs, programs not primarily directed at K-12 education. Other programs excluded from the block grant are: Indian Education, the Inexpensive Book Distribution Program, Arts In Education, Star Schools Program, and Technology Innovation Challenge grants. 
Finally, the distribution of bilingual education funds is changed. These funds will be sent to school districts in the same proportion as the funds were distributed in fiscal year 1997, much like title I funds are distributed in the amendment. For example, if a school district were eligible for .25 percent of all bilingual education funds in fiscal year 1997, it will be eligible for the same share in fiscal year 1998. 
Mr. President, these changes correct minor drafting errors and incorporate the suggestions of several supporters for minor improvements. These changes, however, do not affect the amendment's overall philosophy, which is to restore the decisionmaking authority for the education of our children to where it belongs; the hands of parents, teachers, principals, superintendents, and school board members. I look forward to discussing this issue further with my colleagues during conference committee meetings.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford, to introduce the aviation insurance reauthorization Act of 1997. The bill would reauthorize the aviation insurance program for five years. The program is set to expire at the end of this fiscal year. 
The aviation insurance program, commonly known as war-risk insurance, has been in place since 1951. It insures air carriers against losses resulting from war, terrorism, or other hostile acts, when commercial insurance is canceled, or is unavailable at reasonable rates. For an air carrier to qualify for the program, the President must determine that a flight is essential to the foreign policy interests of the United States. 
The FAA can issue both premium and nonpremium insurance under the program. Premium insurance is issued to air carriers flying commercial operations in foreign air commerce, or between two or more points outside the United States. Nonpremium insurance is issued to air carriers flying missions for Federal agencies, such as the Departments of Defense and State, that have indemnification agreements with the Department of Transportation. Nonpremium insurance accounts for 99 percent of the aviation insurance program. 
Both the premium and nonpremium insurance provides hull coverage for the loss of, or damage to aircraft. The insurance also provides liability coverage for death or bodily injury, and damage to property, baggage and personal effects. Program coverage is limited to the amount of insurance that an air carrier's commercial policy would have provided. The program is self-financed through the aviation insurance revolving fund. 
Reauthorization of the aviation insurance program is noncontroversial. The program enjoys the support of all of its participants. I want to note, however, that my bill adds a new element to the program. It authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] to borrow money from the Federal treasury to pay a claim, in the event that the revolving fund is not sufficient to cover a large claim, or simultaneous claims. I believe that this provision is necessary to ensure that timely payments for hull losses can be made to air carriers. These same carriers typically lease aircraft under agreements that stipulate that the carriers must repair or replace damaged aircraft within 30 days of the incident. 
Although the Congressional Budget Office claims that this provision does not have a significant budget impact, I understand that the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] may disagree. The FAA and the OMB are working with the aviation leadership on the Commerce Committee to resolve this issue. I pledge my full cooperation, and I hope and expect that we can resolve this issue before the Commerce Committee reports out the legislation. 
The Commerce Committee plans to report out the bill as early as next week. The House plans to approve companion legislation next week, as well. I urge my colleagues to work with me to reauthorize the aviation insurance program before it expires at the end of the fiscal year.

 Mr. GORTON. A jury in New Orleans the other week issued a clarion call for legal reform. A monstrous judgment against CSX Transportation and four other companies illustrates once again the arbitrary and perverse nature of our current tort system. 
Mr. President, I rise today to bring to my colleagues' attention a $2.5 billion punitive damage award against CSX Transportation stemming from a 1987 chemical-car fire in the New Orleans neighborhood of Gentilly. Even in the context of our current broken legal system, this one is shocking. The jury awarded $2.5 billion, out of a total punitive damage award of $3.4 billion, against CSXT, Mr. President, despite the fact that Federal experts had determined that CSX was not at fault; despite the fact that the jury did not allocate any significant portion of the compensatory damages to CSXT; despite the fact that actual compensatory damages awarded to date in the case are only $2 million; and despite the fact that the accident resulted in no deaths, no serious injuries, and no significant property damage. 
Comparisons made in a New Orleans Times Picayune article put the total punitive damage award into perspective, warped as it is. Consider that the punitive damage award in this case is seven times the amount Union Carbide paid to settle a claim relating to a chemical leak in Bhopal, India, that killed 4,000 people and injured 300,000. Despite only minor property damage, this award is two-thirds of the punitive damage award against Exxon for the environmentally devastating spill that occurred in Alaska in 1989. 
Let me set out the facts of the case as I understand them from the press accounts. On September 9, 1987, a railroad tank car containing butadiene, a volatile compound used in making synthetic rubber, was located in a rail yard in New Orleans on tracks that belonged to CSXT. Due to a faulty gasket, the contents of the car leaked and the car caught fire. Local officials determined that the best approach was to let the fire burn itself out. To avoid harm to nearby residents, authorities ordered the evacuation of those living near the yard. Many people were inconvenienced, but although there are 8,000 people in the plaintiff class, only 2,300 people claim to have been located within the evacuation zone, and contemporary estimates of how many people were actually evacuated put the number at about 1,000. 
One year after the accident, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Federal agency that investigates transportation accidents, determined that a misaligned gasket and other factors, not involving CSXT, had caused the accident. In fact, other than providing the track on which the train car was placed, CSXT had no connection to the car. CSXT did not own or repair the tank car, and it did not transport the car. 
Significantly, even though the NTSB determined that CSTX had not caused the accident, the jury held CSXT 15 percent responsible for the $2 million on compensatory damages that have been awarded to 20 plaintiffs at this time. The remaining plaintiffs will have to prove their damages in separate proceedings. Though it seems unfair that CSXT would be responsible for any compensatory damages if it was not at fault, it is unspeakably outrageous that CSXT would be assessed over 75 percent of the punitive damages, and only 15 percent of the compensatory damages. 
How can it be that a Federal agency determines that a company has no responsibility for causing an accident and yet this huge verdict is awarded? The answer, unfortunately, is that our tort system is broken. The case in New Orleans is the latest, though perhaps most egregious, example of why we have to reform our civil justice system, to place some reasonable limit on punitive damage awards, to modify the laws regarding joint and several liability, and to provide disincentives for lawyers to go after the `deep pockets,' simply because they're there. 
CSXT is a big corporation, but that should not be reason to impose huge penalties on it, penalties that could affect its thousands of employees, thousands of middle-class stockholders who own shares in the company through their pension plans, and everyone who uses its vital transportation facilities. Until we undertake meaningful legal reform, we will continue to disadvantage businesses and consumers, stunt career opportunities, breed contempt for the law, and do injustice.

Mr. GORTON. 
Mr. President, on Monday, millions of American children will board schoolbuses all across the country. 
But when they get off those buses, will they be walking into schools that challenge them to learn and grow, or into empty shells of missed opportunities and lost hopes? Are we doing the best possible job of educating our children, or can we do better? 
For decades, the conventional wisdom in our Nation's Capital has been that Washington, DC, knows what's best for our schools. I disagree. I think teachers, parents, principals, and school boards know what's best for our children. 
Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed school reform to restore the traditional role that parents and teachers play in education. 
The reform adopted by the Senate sends Federal education funds for kindergarten through high school directly to school districts. 
Bypassing Federal and State bureaucracies, which siphon millions of dollars and attach regulatory strings, means more authority and more money for local educators. 
All of us want the best education possible for our kids. We all want them to succeed. 
A good education unlocks the future, provides a lifetime key to open doors of opportunity and helps our children reach their dreams. We can provide that opportunity to our children by restoring the role that parents, teachers, and principals need to play in education. 
Unfortunately, Washington, DC, takes a different view--the President and Democrats in Congress have denounced this proposal. 
Education should not be a partisan issue, but when this school reform measure was approved by the Senate, not a single Democrat voted for it. And the President has said he will veto this reform when it comes to his desk. 
Apparently, he prefers a system that has Washington, DC, deciding what's best for schoolchildren in Chehalis, WA; New York City, and every place in between. By taking this position, I think the President is telling parents and teachers: `I don't trust you.' 
While I believe the President has taken the wrong position, I know that he and I share the same goal--we both want what is best for our children. The debate is not over who cares more for our children's future--the debate is about how to achieve our shared goal of doing the best we can for children. 
There is nothing more important than our children's future. There are few issues as troubling as the state of our educational system. The next century will demand a lot--advanced technology, the global marketplace, an ever-changing American society--and I am concerned that our children aren't going to be completely prepared for their upcoming challenges. 
There was a time in America when parents and teachers had more say in their children's education. Over time, Washington, DC, gradually took responsibility for education from our home towns, and put it in the hands of Federal bureaucrats. What have we gotten for allowing Washington, DC, to run our local schools? 
Since 1960, education spending has risen 200 percent, but SAT scores are down. Teachers used to make up two-thirds of the full-time school staff--now it is barely half. And schools are more dangerous than ever. 
The Washington, DC-knows best approach to education has also taken us away from the `back to basics' approach long-favored by parents. Skim through your daughter's American history book. Does it instill her with hope? Is it the story of how incredibly diverse people came from all over the globe to pursue boundless opportunities? Or is it a visionless narrative of American failures and shortcomings? 
Those who oppose this measure argue that it's somehow dangerous to entrust parents and teachers with more control over our children's education. Those in Washington, DC guard their power jealously, and they won't give it up easily. 
The President says this proposal will reduce funding for schools, and eliminates the Department of Education--it will not. 
Under this proposal, local schools get more money, and the Department of Education plays a more modest role. 
While fewer bureaucrats and a weakened Department of Education are valuable byproducts of this effort, they are not my primary concern--giving parents and teachers more control over their children's education is my single most important goal. 
One Senator who opposes school reform said he actually thought that parents would build more swimming pools, instead of buying more books, if Washington, DC stops telling our schools how to educate our children. 
I disagree. It's offensive to suggest that parents and teachers don't have the children's best interests in mind. 
I believe that with the additional authority and funding schools would receive from this reform, our teachers, parents, principals, and school boards will be inspired to do even more--not to build swimming pools--they will be inspired to make sure that every child receives the best education possible. 
It comes down to this--will local schools be improved through more rules from Washington, DC, or will they be improved if we restore the authority for education decisions that parents, teachers, and principals once had? 
On this issue, I believe the answers are best left to our parents, teachers, and communities, not Washington, DC.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished colleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford to introduce the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. This act will provide assistance to the families of aviation accident victims who were flying on foreign airlines operating in the United States, assistance that is now provided in the event of the crash of a domestic airline. I would also take this opportunity to recognize Representative Underwood of Guam who recently introduced the companion bill in the House with Representative Duncan and Representative Lipinski. 
The recent tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam, which took the lives of more than 200 people, clearly shows the need for this legislation. As we all know, the news of an air disaster spreads quickly around the world, with pictures and reports about the crash. The media is often at the sight of crash as soon as, if not before, the rescue teams. 
You can imagine how devastating it was for the family members of those flying on Flight 801, as it would be for any family members, to receive media reports about a crash just after it happened. Anyone in such a situation wants to know as quickly as possible what has happened to their loved ones. That is why the Congress passed the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996, which obligates domestic air carriers to have disaster support plans in place. It is why we now need to extend this type of plan to foreign air carriers in the event that they have an accident on American soil. 
Despite the best efforts of rescue personnel and National Transportation Safety Board personnel, it is clear that family members would have been better served if an accident plan had been in effect following the crash of flight 801. Coverage of the accident made us aware that family members suffered a great deal of pain in relation to the search and rescue efforts. We have, sadly enough, already seen the positive effects of family assistance plans for the accidents of domestic air carriers. 
Simply stated, the bill would require that following an accident resulting in a significant loss of life, the foreign airline would have a plan in place to publicize a toll-free number, have staff available to take calls, have an up-to-date list of passengers, and have a process to notify families--in person if possible--before any public notification that a family member was onboard the crashed aircraft. A National Transportation Safety Board employee would serve as the director of family support services, with the assistance of an independent nonprofit organization with experience in disasters and post-trauma communication with families. The legislation also requires the Secretary of Transportation to refuse a foreign air carrier a permit to operate in the U.S. if the carrier does not have a plan in place. 
As Senator McCain indicated, he plans to bring this legislation before the Commerce Committee for markup as early as next week. I will work with Senator McCain to see that we move this legislation as expeditiously as possible. 
I hope that it will never be necessary for the plans required under this legislation to be used. However, should a foreign air carrier have an accident in the United States, we should extend to the family members of victims the consideration and compassion that this legislation provides. I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just 2 or 3 days ago, we had a not dissimilar discussion in this Chamber on proposals that would change present law with respect to Indian and non-Indian relationships. There were two provisions in this bill, of which I was the author, about the immunity of Indian tribes from lawsuit brought by non-Indians and on the way in which money was distributed to Indian tribes through the tribal priority allocations. 
The Senator from Hawaii, with the same degree of eloquence that he has used here this afternoon, spoke strongly against those amendments, along with several of his colleagues, partly on the merits but with even more vehemence and eloquence perhaps from the perspective that these were new proposals reversing many years of history about which the Committee on Indian Affairs had had no opportunity for broad-based hearings, listening to both sides of the issue. 
As strongly as I felt and feel about the justice of those two proposals, I certainly had to agree on that procedural matter with the Senator from Hawaii. There was last year one rather desultory hearing on sovereign immunity, none on the distribution of money from the Congress to Indian tribes. Between now and the middle of next year these two questions will be very seriously considered by the committee itself, by the General Accounting Office, and I think with increasing awareness by Members of the Senate. That history is in striking contrast with the history of the policy that is the subject of the amendment proposed by my friend and colleague from Wyoming. 
I returned to the Senate after a hiatus in 1989 and joined that Indian Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of the Senator from Hawaii. I cannot count the number of hearings the committee has had on this subject. Indian gaming is not something that has a long history. It was authored, if my memory serves me correctly, in 1988, and it has proliferated mightily ever since then with a graph with a steep upward curve. 
Objections and protests from Governors, from State attorneys general, and from communities have been constant from the time of a first compact. Pressure from the Department of the Interior on States to enter compacts even when States did not wish to do so has been a constant in this field. Attempts to overrule vetoes on the part of States has been a constant effort ever since. Year after year after year there are hearings on the subject in that committee and absolutely nothing happens. 
Not only has no bill on the subject reflecting the views of those in whose communities these casinos have been created or about to be created been reported, no bill on the subject at all has been reported and, to the best of my memory, none has ever come to markup so that members of the committee could vote on it. 
So I simply have to tell my friend from Wyoming a promise of hearings is a hollow promise, at least if history is any guide to this question whatsoever. 
I must say to you, Mr. President, that I do come to this debate with a relatively long history, not so much with respect to Indian gambling but with respect to organized gambling overall. It was the subject that came up the first year that I was attorney general of the State of Washington more than a quarter of a century ago. I have always been of the opinion that under most places and under most circumstances it is a socially highly dubious activity that has adverse social and cultural impacts, rivaling those of other kinds of activities that we either prohibit or keep strongly under control. 
At the same time, I recognize the desire under some circumstances to gamble is something that is a part of all of our human natures. Therefore, I have never been an absolute prohibitionist on the subject. Certainly, however, it seems to me that it is a subject important enough so that the views of the communities that are asked to take on challenges and forms of business that they have never historically been visited with ought to be given immense weight in making these decisions. And they simply are not under the law as it exists at the present time. 
I cannot say what the intention or the expectations were of Members who were here when the original bill was passed, but I do not think it was the intention that in State after State and community after community Indian tribes or their designees would purchase land off, in most cases far off, of the historic Indian reservations and immediately, with the compliance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, put it into trust status so that it stopped paying taxes to the community and then license gambling activities on it. And yet that is what has taken place in community after community across the country. In most of these States it is an activity in which only this small group of American citizens is permitted to engage. Very few States have taken the drastic step of saying, well, the Federal Government can foist Indian casinos on us. We might as well let anyone ask for a casino license. 
In most places, it is an activity that is available only for this group of people and only by the interference of the Federal Government. So States lack the ability to enforce rational land and business regulations within their boundaries even outside the historic boundaries of Indian reservations. 
By pure coincidence, Mr. President, in the group of clippings from our own State, which almost all of us get every day, I have today an editorial that was printed late last week in the Yakima, WA, Herald Republic which uses the State of the occupant of the chair as an example. I will share a little bit of it with you. It says:  
Developments in Lincoln City, Ore., could serve as a wakeup call for this state to step back and take a long, hard look at the long-range implications of the proliferation of gambling now underway. 
Officials in Lincoln City, a picturesque family resort area on the Oregon coast, have noticed some changes in the landscape of the community since the advent of the Chinook Winds Casino and Convention Center. A local tavern started featuring exotic dancers while three new quasi-pawn shops and a check-cashing business opened. 
Longtime residents say they've noticed other changes in the community and Lincoln City Mayor Foster Aschenbrenner said the real effects of the casino on the community will take at least two more years to fully realize. 
`People used to come here for the natural beauty of the beaches and for swimming,' said Merilynn Webb, who has lived in Lincoln City since 1930. `Now they come to gamble, and that's a whole different mentality.' 
I doubt that the people of Lincoln City voted on this change. I doubt that the Oregon Legislature did. Perhaps the occupant of the chair will be able to enlighten us on that. I doubt that there is a huge Indian reservation inside the boundaries of Lincoln City. Yet, this change has taken place in that community without the kind of thoughtful, long-range consideration that a community should be permitted to engage in before such activities are permitted. 
Last year, this body and the House and the President agreed that the proliferation of organized and legal gambling in the United States did present a number of very real social problems to the country. We created a commission on gambling to study those impacts and to make recommendations to us with respect to them. The net effect of the amendment proposed by the Senator from Wyoming would be at least for a time--I wish the moratorium were for a longer period of time, but for a period of time to allow that commission to hold its hearings, to work on its recommendations and perhaps give it the opportunity to make recommendations to us in this connection while those recommendations still may have some meaning rather than to wait until after it is all over. The offer of the Senator, the meaning of his amendment, is simply to say, `look, why should this simply be a decision made by the Indian tribes themselves and the Department of the Interior without an effective right of veto, or an effective right to have these requests meet the requirements of the general laws of each of the States concerned?" 
I cannot think of a more reasonable request. I certainly can't believe that it is unreasonable to say that we should have a pause in the creation of enclaves outside of reservations, in communities in which the Secretary of the Interior can authorize gambling, when we are way beyond reservation boundaries themselves. 
In fact, I don't think--I don't know the answer to this question--that many of these new casinos are going up in areas that are on the reservation. I know one current request to the State of Washington is for a location 50, 60, 100 miles from the reservation that promotes it, right at the front gate of an Air Force base. There is no promise by the Indian tribe that any significant share, any significant number of the members of the tribe will be employed in that casino. Almost certainly it will be run by an outside contractor and the tribe will get a certain percentage of the take. It is not going to provide real job opportunities there, but it will have the same effect that every other casino has. The money that is spent there is not being spent in small businesses in the community, or in other communities. There will be a certain addition to the number of addicted gamblers and broken families. And we don't have the opportunity to consider all of these impacts. 
The proposal by the Senator from Wyoming gives us an opportunity, for 1 year, to pause to determine whether, whatever the positive impacts of this law are, they are not outweighed by the negative impacts. It is not permanent in nature. It will not outlast the effectiveness of this 1-year appropriations bill. But it will cause us to be able to consider these impacts. 
I don't believe that in all these years since 1989 we have ever debated this issue on the floor of the Senate. Certainly we have not done so because of any bill reported by the Indian Affairs Committee. In fact, it would seem to me that the goals of the vice chairman of the committee, the Senator from Hawaii, would be better served if we passed this moratorium. I am certain that, if we pass the moratorium, the Indian Affairs Committee will consider the matter urgently, and I strongly suspect we will see a bill of some sort reported by it. But, if history is any guide, withdrawing the amendment in exchange for hearings will cause us to be back here 1 year from today talking about the same issue under the same set of circumstances that we are talking about it today but with a dozen or more additional Indian casinos across the country creating problems in each and every community in which they exist. 
So I must say that I strongly support the effort being made 
by the Senator from Wyoming. I think it is the right answer. I think it is a thoughtful answer to a real national challenge that involves far more than the question of whether or not particular Indian tribes are making particular degrees of profits from these activities, or not. This is a question that goes far, far beyond that and I think can only be addressed thoughtfully and objectively, considering all of its impacts, if we have the kind of pause for which the amendment calls. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two points rather briefly in opposing, with regret, the amendment proposed by my two friends and colleagues: 
The first is in no way to deprecate or understate the problem of gang violence on Indian reservations, or, for that matter, in any other place, but simply to point out that this bill includes greater increases for Indian programs taken as a whole than it does for any other set of programs. 
At the request of the President and of the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, tribal priority allocations are increased by some $76 million, the distribution of which is to be determined primarily by Indian organizations themselves, any portion of which can be dedicated to this purpose. 
Second, the appropriations bill managed by my friend from Colorado, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, the appropriations bill for Treasury-Postal increases the so-called grant program to $13 million with specific reference to criminal gang activity on Indian reservations and a direction to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms to help curtail 
that gang violence. This $13 million in that bill can be used in whole or in part for the goal that the two Senators aim at. When one totals up all of the public safety and justice programs in the bill before us, the Interior bill, that is an additional $116 million-plus. 
Obviously, not all of that, not even a large percentage of it, is going to be used to combat gang violence. 
The point is that in this bill, and in the Treasury-Postal bill, there is a true recognition of the seriousness of the problem and significant resources that can be devoted to dealing with that problem. 
As a consequence, my attitude toward this amendment would change 180 degrees if this amendment were an earmark of some of those tribal priority allocations specifically to gang-related violence. Personally, I think an earmark would probably be unnecessary. 
I accept the seriousness of the problem, as described by my two colleagues, and suspect that those who determine where those tribal priority allocations will go will share those views. 
The point is that if this amendment had come out of Indian activities, it would not need to be discussed here at any length. We simply would have accepted it. Instead, Mr. President, it comes out of the destruction of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial. 
Last Thursday, when we began this debate, I presented this chart in this large form here on the floor, but with a small one to every Member of the body, showing the relative division of moneys within the Department of the Interior budget--the green on the left being the management of all of our public land, the various blues, almost $4 billion in this bill, for Indian activities. Then we have to come all the way over here to this very short line for all of the cultural activities supported by this bill. In this short line, one-fifth of the amount that goes for Indian programs in total is included in the Smithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, the Holocaust Museum, the two endowments that we debated some 4 days on the floor here, and in a line that would be too small to see on a chart of this size, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 
Mr. President, we should not slow up opportunities for scholarly research in the United States. We should not abandon an institution that admittedly authorizes studies in a number of esoteric scholarly pursuits. That simply isn't the way in which we ought to treat our own history, or our own culture. A place outside of the rest of the world for longer or shorter periods of reflection and writing on the part of scholars is not, Mr. President, I am convinced a waste of the taxpayers' money. 
I believe the House of Representatives was wrong to follow the course of action that it did in this respect. But by reflecting the views of the House of Representatives, we are saying, fine, there will be $1 million to close down this memorial. It may not be exactly analogous to closing down the Lincoln Memorial, though it is a memorial to a famous President of the United States. But we aren't considering closing down the Lincoln Memorial because it doesn't make money or produce an immediate income. 
Woodrow Wilson was himself a scholar, a president of a university, and Congress deemed the best memorial to him would be a place at which scholarly pursuits could be followed. 
But this amendment would destroy that institution forever in order to fund an activity for a single year for which there is already an ample source of funds. 
So, I must say that I believe it to be an ill-advised amendment--once again, not so much because there can be criticism of the goal that it pursues, but because the goal is already adequately pursued in this and other bills and should not be the excuse to destroy one of the smallest elements of this bill directed at the preservation of American culture, the addition to our fund of knowledge about our own history and about the world around us. 
We can vote on this amendment. I hope, if we do, that it is defeated. We could modify the amendment so that it becomes an earmark out of the already large and justified appropriations for Indian activities, one that has a greater increase this year than any other. We should not vote for it in its present form.

Mr. GORTON. This is correct. The Senator from Utah rightly points out that Section 304 of Public Law 104-333 recognizes Phase One facility construction and operation activities as set forth in the Snowbasin Ski Area Master Development Plan dated October 1995. This statute specifically states that `. . . `Phase I' facilities referred to in the Master Plan . . . are limited in size and scope, and are reasonable and necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics, and in some cases are required to provide for the safety for skiing competitors and spectators.' Clearly, this project falls within the parameters of Public Law 104-333, Section 304 and is vital to the successful execution of the Downhill event.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will not at this point speak to the merits of the amendment. Both the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Alaska have done so, each of them repeating points that I can remember having heard almost verbatim in several previous sessions of Congress. My remarks will be much more narrow. 
Section (d)(1) of this amendment states: 
Any person producing hardrock minerals from a mine that was within a mining claim that has subsequently been patented under the general mining laws shall pay a reclamation fee to the Secretary under this subsection. 
The Senator from Arkansas quite properly described that fee as a severance tax, and a severance tax it is. It applies only to minerals coming out, presumably, in the future from certain classes of lands in the United States. It is not something directed at the restoration of those lands, but is to be used as a source of money for much broader purposes. 
The Senator's description of it as a tax is accurate. 
Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States under which we operate states--and I quote-- 
All Bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives. 
No such tax appears in the similar bill that the House of Representatives has passed. 
It is crystal clear to me that should this tax be added on to this bill it will be blue slipped in the House of Representatives, that is, it will not be considered on the grounds that that portion of the bill, that subject of the bill could only originate in the House. 
The House of Representatives is as jealous of its prerogatives to originate tax bills as the Senate is to ratifying treaties or to confirm Presidential appointments or to engage in any of the activities that are lodged by the Constitution in this body.

Mr. GORTON. Two brief points. First, the Senator from New Hampshire describes what is an entirely reasonable point, it seems to me, if we are talking about land sold by the United States in the future. 
But in effect he is saying a policy we ought to adopt is one that would be analogous to something in my own State, where 20 years ago you sold shares of stock in Microsoft for $10 a share and they are now worth $100,000 a share today, and he says, `Gee, I made a bad bargain. I ought to get some more of that back. I want a share of that profit.' That goes to the equities of the position. 
The point before the Senate now is whether or not we can constitutionally deal with this. The Senator from Louisiana made the perfect argument on our side. She said we aren't getting enough taxes, we need to get more taxes out of these lands. 
That is exactly what the Senator proposes to do--tax these lands. Tax bills must originate in the House of Representatives. This does not originate in the House of Representatives. It is not something that this body constitutionally can deal with. That is the point on which we are going to vote.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is constructed in a fashion that evades budget points of order. That is to say, no points of order would be appropriate. But it does take advantage of a quite conservative estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of the revenues that may accrue from the sale of Elk Hills. 
I also note that the amendment could result in the Department of Energy capturing several hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue that could otherwise go into the General Treasury. As a member of the Budget Committee, this is a precedent about which I have some real concern. 
On the other hand, as I said from the time that the House bill passed and we worked on our own, I am not completely comfortable with the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, including the sale in the bill that is in the President's budget request and House action. 
Having said all of that, balancing on both sides, I am willing to accept the amendment, as is my comanager from Nevada. We can deal with the issue in conference, and I hope that it is either acceptable or can be put into acceptable form.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is not acceptable. We had worked all day with the senior Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Arizona on a proposal that I had not previously seen that really ought to be authorized, even in its original form, and about which I have some concerns, the composition of the research board, the involvement of the Department of the Interior, the way in which money is allocated, the kind of scoring problems that we will have which will create problems with the Budget Committee. But it seemed to me that the compromise that we had reached on it among several of us was clearly worth going forward with. 
This second-degree amendment involves now $1.6 billion, at 8 o'clock at night, when we were attempting to finish a bill on which it does not belong because it needs to be authorized, and it has not been cleared on the other side. We made no attempt to clear it on the other side. I did not know it was coming. Other Senators, including the majority leader, feel as I do.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader and I, and I think most Members, do wish to complete action on this bill today. 
At this point, I know of three or four rather hotly contested amendments: One by Mr. Hutchinson, the Senator from Arkansas, on American heritage rivers; the possibility of one on immigration reform that is, of course, not particularly germane to this bill, by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack; an Indian gambling amendment by Senators Enzi and Brownback; and one relating to money for gang suppression on Indian reservations which would close down the Wilson Center here. 
I hope we could move forward on each of these promptly. I note that the Senator from Arkansas is present. Perhaps his amendment can be put up next. We would seek a time agreement on it. I don't believe the other side is ready to agree to a time agreement yet. Perhaps the best thing to do is let the Senator from Arkansas introduce his amendment, speak to it, and as he speaks to it and others are concerned about it, we can see whether or not a time agreement can be reached.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment proposed by the Senator from Arkansas is a most interesting one. I think it is one that I am very likely to support. There is, however, some opposition on each side of the aisle. So we have been unable to reach any kind of agreement on a time limit on it. A number of my friends on the other side of the aisle do wish to speak to it. They are not here at the present time, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum. I also suggest that there are other amendments on which time agreements may be relatively easy to reach. On this one it can't be reached. If the Senator from Arizona, [Mr. Kyl], is within hearing, I would appreciate taking up his amendment as soon as possible. The same thing holds true for the senior Senator from Arkansas, who has one on which there might well be a time agreement. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

So on my own behalf, and on behalf of the majority leader, if, at the conclusion of Senator D'Amato's comments, debate seems to have been concluded, it will be appropriate either to vote on the amendment directly or for the Senator from Connecticut to make a motion to table.

Mr. GORTON. If the Senator from New York will yield, the Senator from Minnesota is here wishing to speak. I think it is appropriate that the Senator from Arkansas get to terminate the debate. If the Senator from New York doesn't wish to stay, perhaps it would be appropriate for me to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New York, together with the Senator from Connecticut, be allowed to move to table at this point, but ask unanimous consent that after the motion to table is put, but before it is voted on, that the Senator from Minnesota have 5 minutes and the Senator from Arkansas have 5 minutes, after which a vote would take place on the motion to table. Would that be acceptable? I put 
that request to the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Yes, the Senator from Nebraska is correct as to this funding shortfall. In addition, there are two other nonhospital facilities in Arizona for which appropriated design funds have not been sufficient. The administration's fiscal year 1998 budget did not request design funds for these facilities either. This lack of a funding request has meant that neither the House nor the Senate has included funds necessary to complete the design phase for the Winnebago Hospital.

Mr. GORTON. It is my understanding that a total of $2.1 million would be needed to complete the design phase for the three projects. There simply is not that leeway in the measure we are considering today. However, should funds become available as a result of conference agreements with the House, I will try to see that they are made available for completion of the design phase of the three projects if that is agreeable to my colleague, Senator Byrd.

Mr. GORTON. I understand the Senator's concerns. The committee intends that the funds are used toward the design and construction of renovating and improving the existing facility. Making improvements to accommodate existing services is certainly acceptable. Such measures would include replacing temporary housing with a permanent addition as well as enlarging the emergency room, or adding examination rooms. The use of the word expansion in the committee report was used to indicate that the committee cannot ensure that additional funding--beyond what is currently provided in this bill--will be provided by virtue of facility improvements being made at this location. If additional costs are anticipated because of a larger facility than presently exists, the committee will consider these needs but can make no guarantees.

Mr. GORTON. As the Presiding Officer is well aware, this has been a highly complex bill with a large number of amendments, colloquies, inquiries, extensive debate and the like, and it almost, but not quite, goes without saying that it would have been impossible to reach this point without the service of large numbers of dedicated staff, many of those for individual Senators with whom my staff and committee staff have worked. But I want particularly to thank Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Martin Delgado, Hank Kashdan, and Kevin Johnson of the majority staff of the Interior subcommittee for countless hours in preparing the bill and helping me in debate; 
Sue Masica, Lisa Mendelson and Carole Geagley, of Senator Byrd's staff, for similar and equally important work. The two staff directors of the overall Appropriations Committee in the minority, Steve Cortese and Jim English; from my own personal staff, Chuck Berwick and Nina Nguyen, who also have worked countless hours. But most of all, the young man sitting beside me, Bruce Evans, who is the new staff director for the Interior subcommittee, who has gone through this for the first time with flying colors; who seems to be able to write some of my remarks in exactly the same way I would phrase them myself and who has been vital to our success. I hope this praise spurs them on to ever more successful work as we deal with the House, and the many differences between the two bills. 
Finally, I want to say, Mr. President, even though he is absent, how greatly I appreciated the guidance and support of Senator Byrd, the most senior Member of the Democratic Party, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and of course the ranking member of this subcommittee. From the moment I took the chairmanship of the subcommittee, he has been helpful and cooperative. He has pointed out many pitfalls into which I otherwise would have fallen, and has been a true friend and colleague, in a bill I think it is safe to say that is highly bipartisan in nature. In spite of the many amendments with great contests, most of them have involved votes that have crossed party lines. And Senator Byrd has been a wonderful ally and friend in that connection. 
With that, I am ready to go to conference on this bill and allow the Senate to move onto another subject.

<DOCNO>105-gorton-wa-1-19970917</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada states that it is not the purpose of this amendment to terminate harvesting in our national forests. He also states that it is the intent of the amendment to reduce harvesting in our national forests. He recognizes that the impact of the amendment will be to lower the gross income of the Forest Service from timber sales because, obviously, bids will reflect the cost of constructing roads. He says that the amendment will not terminate the construction of roads in roadless areas, but that the construction of roads in roadless areas is wrong. 
Now, I guess the question that one must ask of the Senator from Nevada, and the outside organizations that back his amendment, is, what is their view toward the harvesting of forest products in our national forests? The Senator from Nevada has graced us with a set of graphs and a chart that indicates increasing harvests on private lands and rapidly decreasing harvests on public lands. In the 1980's, nearly 12 billion board feet a year were harvested from Forest Service lands--a harvest smaller in board feet than the regeneration of those lands. Today, that level is below 4 million board feet. In other words, harvests on those lands have been reduced by more than two-thirds. How much more reduction does the Senator from Nevada propose? 
The organizations that he proudly announced are supporting his amendment, by and large, have as their articulated policy that there should be no harvest on public lands anywhere, at any time, under any circumstances. And while this amendment, standing alone, will not have that effect, it is clearly designed as a part of a campaign to end all such harvests. 
At the present time, again, as indicated by the chart that the Senator from Nevada has there, only about 5 percent of the Nation's softwood comes from Forest Service lands, but 50 percent of the volume is located on those lands. Since the policies that have resulted in that dramatic decrease have taken place, the average price of an 1,800-square-foot new home has gone up about $2,000. Almost $3 billion from the pockets of American home purchasers is the result of those efforts to save the spotted owl and to meet other of the priorities so eloquently set out by the Senator from Nevada. 
Interestingly enough, when an outside organization--Price Waterhouse--filed a report entitled `Financing Roads on the National Forests,' it reached this conclusion: 
The forest roads program does not contain a subsidy for timber purchasers. It provides an efficient and effective mechanism for financing road construction and reconstruction. 
Interestingly enough, the administration, at least as recently as January and February, agreed totally with that position, and it indicates no savings associated with the elimination of the forest roads program. 
Moreover, the appropriation for forest roads that we are defending here today is the administration's own proposal. This is not a budget that increases that appropriation; it is a budget that reflects that appropriation. Is the Senator from Nevada seriously presenting to us the proposition that this Clinton administration is engaged in irresponsible forest harvest contracting, that it is ignoring environmental and fiscal concerns and causing our forests to be harvested at an unsustainable or environmentally harmful rate? He must be making that proposition. He wants the two-thirds reduction that has taken place over the course of the last decade to be a more-than-two-thirds reduction. He wants this administration to stop what he considers irresponsible contracting for forest harvesting in our national forests. 
Mr. President, no one who is concerned with any kind of balance in the management of our national forests can possibly reach the conclusion that the Clinton administration's Forest Service management and supervision is recklessly and irresponsibly harvesting our national forests. Almost all of the criticism is on the other side, except for the organizations that are backing this amendment, whose position is that the only good harvest is no harvest at all. 
Now, if the Senator from Nevada believes that, I think it would be more forthright simply to propose that and see whether or not the Members of the Senate agree. But this forest roads program, the way in which it was set up, is designed to see to it that the roads are built efficiently and well, according to Forest Service standards, and appropriately paid for. Simply to take money out of one pocket and put it into another will not, in any way, enhance the Federal Treasury. Bids will be lower--probably considerably lower--as the risk of costs have shifted from one side to another and the quality of roads will be lower. But let's look at the entire program that we are talking about here. 
In fact, of this entire appropriation for 1996, only a very modest amount is for the construction of roads; the great bulk is for reconstruction. From the credit system, from the appropriation, practically none is for construction, and a modest amount is for reconstruction. But three-quarters of the amount is for the obliteration of roads, about which the Senator from Nevada spoke so eloquently. 
Eighty percent of all of the reconstruction that is so important is paid for by purchaser credit, not by appropriations on the part of this body. In fact, Mr. President, the net result of passing this amendment will not only be a further reduction in harvest, it will be a dramatic reduction in the availability of our forests from a wide range of recreational activity. It will be the de facto creation of more tens of billions of acres that cannot effectively be enjoyed by the vast majority of the people of the United States. 
I want to emphasize that in this case we are defending the recommendations in the budget of the President and of the Forest Service--a Forest Service that has designed the reduction and harvest as far as it has gone. And I believe that the most appropriate points for the proponents of this amendment to make are having reduced our Forest Service harvest by two-thirds, having shifted almost 95 percent of all of the harvesting of forest products onto private lands that contain 50 percent of the resource. How much further do they wish to go? Their supporters say no harvest at all. This amendment is one dramatic step toward that goal. 
Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Idaho may wish to take.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this should be charged to my own time on this amendment. 
Mr. President, I recommend to my colleagues the rejection of the Ashcroft amendment with a degree of sympathy and understanding of the purity and the sincerity of his motives. I don't intend to go into great detail on it. Personally, I think there has been too much detail spent on this amendment and this bill already. 
Fundamentally, however, there are large numbers of people in the United States who believe passionately in the mission of the National Endowment for the Arts. There are millions more who benefit from it directly or indirectly through the various institutions, musical and otherwise, that it supports and the outreach in educational benefits that they provide. At the same time, there is not the slightest doubt but that the National Endowment for the Arts frequently follows the most recent politically correct trends, that it has wasted some of the money that has been granted to it and has financed other exhibits under the broad definition of `art' that are fundamentally offensive to large numbers--often to a majority of the American people. 
I believe that the reforms of the last few years have to a significant degree corrected that shortcoming but that no set of reforms could correct them forever, simply because we have grants at two different levels. The first are the direct grants from the National Endowment itself over which we should exercise at least a degree of control that we already have and about which the National Endowment should be even more sensitive than it has been in the past. The second level, of course, are what grantees do with grants that they get from the National Endowment for the Arts. The process is more difficult for us to control and often presents some difficulty to the Endowment itself. 
I have little doubt that there are those at the extremes of the art community who deliberately go out of their way to use money to offend a majority of Americans. But I want them to control the ultimate outcome of this debate no more than I want it controlled by those who would remove all limits from the National Endowment and spend far more money on it than we are doing at the present time. 
I believe that on balance it is a healthy influence in American society and, therefore, I think agreeing with the House in abolishing it, as this amendment would do, is inappropriate. 
I have a somewhat greater degree of sympathy with those proposals that would decentralize it and give more to State art entities, although I must say I am not at all sure they are going to be less politically correct than is the National Endowment itself. My own opinion is that it is likely that we will come out of the conference committee with a somewhat more decentralized system than we have at the present time. 
But, for the purposes of this debate, I don't believe that the Senate is going to accept the Ashcroft amendment. There was no sentiment for it on the 15-member subcommittee that I headed that reported this bill, and I do believe this is a case in which we should strive for greater improvement and greater public acceptability rather than destroy the entity in its entirety. 
I yield the remainder of my time. 
I believe it is appropriate for the proponent of the amendment to have the last word.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, harvesters in national forests have declined by more than two-thirds over the course of the last several years. This amendment is designed to cause them to decline still further. Many of its principal sponsors outside of this body have as their design the entire termination of any harvest on our Federal lands. This proposal drives significantly in that direction. 
The amount of money in the bill for Forest Service roads is the recommendation of the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration reflects no savings of money by the ending of the Forest Service credit. It is simply another step in the desire to see to it that there is no harvest whatsoever on our forest lands.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I also express my strong hope and preference, and that of the majority leader, that after disposition of the Ashcroft amendment, unless it is adopted, that we proceed promptly to the consideration of the other amendments relating to the National Endowment for the Arts. They are: an amendment by Senator Abraham; an amendment by Senator Sessions and Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas; and an amendment by Senator Hutchison of Texas. Each of them has been debated thoroughly. While no unanimous-consent request has been made with respect to any of them, I hope that we will be able to get relatively short debate periods and thereby finish dealing with the most controversial aspect of this bill. 
There are also other outstanding amendments, some of which may require rollcall votes. I know of one relating to forest roads that will be proposed by Senator Bryan of Nevada. I hope we will, within the hour at least, be able to arrange a time for its debate. 
I believe that there are a couple of others. I am also delighted to report that Senator Bumpers and Senator Reid have apparently reached an agreement on an element in this bill which divided the two of them. I believe that, again, within the hour or hour and a half, we may be able to adopt an agreed amendment on that subject. 
I know the majority leader still would like to finish this bill tonight. That may be a vain hope, but I certainly hope we will get a long way toward that end. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

As is the case with any measure developed over a long process, there are parts of this title which will not please everyone. I believe my proposal represents the most comprehensive solution possible given this issue's complexity. While I sincerely hope that we do not have to revisit this issue again next year, it is certainly appropriate to look at the next year as a test period, to evaluate how well the provision works, and to assess what changes, if any, are necessary. I commit to my colleague from Idaho that I will work with him and other interested Senators and parties to this end.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for helping in getting this debate going. We already have a unanimous-consent agreement for a debate on the Ashcroft amendment on the National Endowment for the Arts of a maximum of 145 minutes beginning at 1:30. So there will be a vote on or in relation to the Ashcroft amendment before 4 o'clock. Personally, I hope it is much before 4 o'clock if not all of that time is used. There are 2 hours between now and the time at which that amendment starts. 
My friend, Senator Bryan, from Nevada, seems perhaps, I hope, ready for a 1 1/2 hour debate on his amendment on forest roads. I am attempting to clear that on this side of the aisle and hope I can have it done so that we can complete that amendment and have the vote before the NEA debate begins. I do know there are several other National Endowment for the Arts amendments that will succeed the Ashcroft amendment, and maybe one or two others that require votes. Senator Bumpers may have one on mining. 
The majority leader is correct; we have been on this bill off and on, mostly on, since last Friday. We have yet to have our first rollcall vote on the bill or on any amendment to the bill. It is time to get going, and I believe my colleagues are about ready to do just that.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of the discussion of this bill last Thursday afternoon, my subcommittee is an extremely popular one. I had some 1,800 special requests from Members, almost all for projects of one sort or another in their own States. I believe we may finish this bill tomorrow, but we have some two pages of amendments, most of which are not matters of profound national policy but, again, for specific programs or projects in individual States. 
It is with that in mind that I want to say how refreshing it is to hear from these two Senators of their tremendous desire to save the sites of the most important battles, many of the most important battles, in the history of the United States that were fought in that profound turning point in our history, the Civil War. 
I am quite a Civil War buff myself, a fan of Professor McPherson's book, perhaps an even greater fan of Shelby Foote, but with all of my reading, I fail to remember a single battle that took place in the State of New Jersey, and I can remember of only one skirmish that took place in the State of Vermont that was made into a movie a couple of decades ago. So the Senate has not heard from two Senators who are attempting to create projects in their own States. They are hearing from Senators who care deeply about our heritage and care deeply about the preservation of the physical aspects of that heritage. 
At least two of the amendments that will be adopted tomorrow will relate to sites of battles that have already been preserved in large part but where the ravages of time are having a negative impact. The Senators know of my bias in favor of supporting them. 
Even so, when the two Senators who sponsor this amendment first brought it to me, they placed me on the horns of a dilemma from which they now have most graciously removed me. The source of the money for the preservation of these sites is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. A $700 million infusion into the Land and Water Conservation Fund was a recommendation of the President, which at least at that level was acceded to by the Senate leadership in negotiations over the budget. It was not a mandatory part of that budget agreement. The House of Representatives omitted to fund any portion of that $700 million. 
Feeling very strongly, in general terms, about the importance of not just this kind of preservation but of other preservation, my bill does include that $700 million. It sets three priority items for use of that money, two of which amount to almost half of the $700 million, high-profile priorities of the President of the United States--the Headwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana. 
Another $100 million in it is appropriately earmarked for the States' share program, money to share with the States as we have in the past for their own preservation of recreational and other property. 
So when the Secretary of the Interior came to me with this request, we made the determination that we would not earmark money directly for any other projects. I didn't want to be faced with a whole series of recommendations from the administration in which we in the Congress played no role. And I think it's safe to say the Secretary of the Interior and the administration didn't want us to spend all of the money without the administration playing any role in that determination. So I agreed that we would oppose additional specific earmarks in this bill. 
At that point, these two Senators came along, either on their own, or knowing my own biases, and asked for money for a purpose which I think is worthy and of the highest possible priority. So they did put me on the horns of a dilemma. They have now agreed to make this a sense-of-the-Senate resolution as to how the money ought to be spent, with my support and with the support of the majority leader. 
So I want to do two things. I want to thank them for phrasing it in this fashion and I pledge my support as we vote on the amendment. I also want to tell them that as we do work with the administration to set priorities across the country for the spending of the money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, assuming that we can get the House of Representatives to agree that we are going to have the money at all, it is very difficult for me to imagine any higher priority than the preservation of these Civil War sites. So I want to agree with this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand that the proponents of the Ashcroft-Helms amendment are not willing to vote on that amendment today and wish that vote to take place tomorrow so that they have a greater opportunity to discuss it both here on the floor of the Senate and in public. I am firmly of the opinion, because that is the amendment that deals with the National Endowment for the Arts in the most radical fashion, that it should be voted on first, because if it is defeated, there are other amendments, including one sponsored by the Presiding Officer, that 
may get a fairer and broader view if they are voted on in an appropriate sequence. 
So I intend, and I believe the majority leader intends, to try to see to it that all Members who wish to speak on the National Endowment for the Arts and any of the four amendments that have been offered and spoken to so far have the opportunity to do so and that, at an appropriate time tomorrow, we vote first on the Ashcroft-Helms amendment, second on the Abraham amendment, third on the amendment of which the Presiding Officer is the sponsor, fourth, the amendment of Senator Hutchison of Texas, with I hope relatively small or short debate times in between the amendments, hoping that people will have had the ability to say all they wish to say about them in the course of discussing all of them together. There is no agreement at this point that this will be precisely the procedure, but I think it is likely. 
In the meantime, for the remainder of the afternoon, we are open for business. There are two controversial provisions relating to Indian matters. I am attempting to get the other Senators, in addition to myself, to the floor as soon as possible to consider those. They will not require a vote but will take a certain degree of discussion. 
I have been told that Senator Bumpers will be willing to present one or more amendments this afternoon, to have them debated and perhaps to have a vote by early this evening. Assuming that he and/or his staff are within hearing, I hope that he will come to the floor as soon as possible and present his amendment and will notify his opponents or ask us to notify his opponents of the fact that he is doing so, so that we can talk about them. 
We should not waste this afternoon, Mr. President. If we get some business accomplished today, there is still a very real possibility that we can finish debate on the Interior appropriations bill by tomorrow evening and go on to other questions. The debate so far has been healthy. I look forward to any Member who wishes to come to the floor and propose an amendment. With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I note the presence on the floor of Senator Campbell, who is the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs. He and I and Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator Domenici, and Senator McCain have had extensive discussions over sections 118 and 120 of this bill, both of which relate to appropriations for or conditions under which Indian tribes operate in our American system. Both are of considerable importance. 
We have reached agreement with respect to the bill and with respect to what will take place after this bill has passed. In that connection, I think it will be a matter of some intense relief to many of my colleagues that what we are going to do is not require a rollcall vote at this point. So it does seem to me, in the absence of any Member here who is willing to send up an amendment that will require a rollcall vote, that we should go through this matter. Two of the Senators are present on the floor. I believe others are coming. 
With that, I yield the floor and hope that the Chair will recognize Senator Campbell.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the interests of clarity in dealing with two related but distinct issues, I have asked, and the Senator from Colorado has agreed, to deal separately with two amendments on his part to sections 118 and 120. So, while most of the speakers have talked about each, to this point, now, before we vote on the proposal of the Senator from Colorado, I am going to address only section 118, the section that calls, in the form in which it was reported by the Indian Affairs Committee, for a study not only of the needs of Indian communities across the land but the resources available to those Indian communities to support, in whole or in part, their governmental entities. 
These tribal priority allocations, in the amount of just over three-quarters of a billion dollars, are directed at the activities, on the broadest possible scale, of the self-governing Indian tribal organizations all across the United States, numbering several hundred in total. And there are, it seems to me, two distinct questions even as we deal with this appropriation of more than three-quarters of a billion dollars of the money of all of the taxpayers of the United States. The first is: Is the historic distribution of money from this 
account to the various Indian tribes done in a fair and rational manner? And, if not, what can be done to improve that method of distribution? 
The second and quite distinct question is whether or not full support of Indian tribal governments is a permanent duty of the people of the United States; a form of entitlement or a matter of discretion in which the people of the United States, in addition to encouraging the development of self-governing institutions, are also entitled to demand on the part of successful Indian governments an increasing duty of self-support of these governing institutions--the tribal legislatures, the court systems, the police systems, and the like, systems that in our Federal system are paid for by the people of the United States in connection with this Congress, the people of the States with their legislatures, and the people of cities, counties, and towns with respect to their governing institutions. And we ran into opposition in connection with each of these; a protection of the status quo in connection with each. 
I took over the chairmanship of this subcommittee 2 years ago, and for 2 years asked the Bureau of Indian Affairs, when it justified its budget, about the formula through which it distributed its moneys to Indian tribes, without getting a satisfactory answer. Asked whether or not it had any ability to determine the relative needs of the varying tribes in the United States, the reluctant, ultimate answer was, no, the Bureau of Indian affairs didn't have that kind of information, did not know in any detail the income of tribal governments through gaming, through gambling operations, through natural resource extraction, through rental of its properties and the like. 
Moreover, it became quite clear that the Bureau of Indian Affairs didn't care to get that information. The reason that the Bureau of Indian Affairs doesn't really care about getting that information is that it does, in fact, believe that these payments are a permanent entitlement, a permanent burden on all of the other taxpayers of the United States, and that, therefore, while perhaps an examination of needs is appropriate, an examination of resources is not appropriate in any respect whatsoever. 
With both of those propositions I disagree. While section 118 that exists in the bill today does not change the system and require a mandated distribution on the basis of a system of needs, which of course implies something about the resources that cover these needs on the part of each individual tribe, it became evident that there is so much disagreement in Indian country with even a determination of the facts on which we can make a later determination of needs and resources that section 118 was unacceptable. 
The proposal that Senator Campbell has made, and with which I agree, deals rather narrowly with the distribution of the money in this appropriations bill, increased by something more than $75 million over the current year, and most particularly with the way 
in which any excess over last year's distribution and over a formula already developed in the Bureau of Indian Affairs will be made. In that connection, it is a significant step and it is something with which I agree. Because it is insufficient, however, because it doesn't even mention either needs or resources, in my view something else very significantly is needed. 
Before I get into that, however, much of the debate on the other side of this issue, many of the newspaper editorials, have spoken of the appropriation for tribal governments, so-called TPA, as an entitlement based on treaty--because there are several hundred treaties with various Indian tribes, the last of which was ratified in 1868--that we are in fact dealing with an entitlement, that we should not look at relative needs, we should not look at the ability to provide for governments through the resources of Indian tribes at all because this is a matter of treaty obligation between the Government of the United States and these various Indian tribes. 
I wish to make the point, as we look forward to a future debate on this issue, that there is no such treaty right. Mr. President, there is no such treaty right. We found one treaty with one tribe that calls for payment in perpetuity of several thousand dollars a year. Most Indian treaties, however--and we use here the treaty of Point Elliott in my own State, a treaty signed in 1855, that includes a clause very much like this one:  
In consideration of the above cession [that is the lands the Indians were signing away] the United States agree to pay to the said tribes and bands the sum of $150,000 in the following manner. 
And it sets out declining annual payments for a period of 20 years, ending, presumably, in 1875, or in 1876. That is the typical Indian treaty with respect to a fiscal obligation on the part of the people of the United States. Obviously, that period of time ran out over a century ago. The optimism with which it was signed, the implication being that by that time the Indians would be integrated into the larger society, did not take place, and the Congress of the United States has gone through several phases of attitudes toward Indian tribes, toward their integration, toward their self-determination and the like. We are now in a period of time in which the strong public opinion, and opinion in this Congress, is in favor of self-determination, conscious self-determination in the Indian institutions. 
The point I am making here is not to disagree with that policy. I think it is a perfectly appropriate policy and one that I have supported. The point that I am making here is that it is a discretionary policy, and that this three-quarters of a billion dollars is appropriated as any other discretionary account is in the Congress of the United States. Therefore, it is totally appropriate for us to determine whether we think the money is being well spent, whether we think it is being fairly distributed, whether we think there is a better formula, whether we think there should be some obligation on the part of wealthier tribes to pay all or part of the cost of their own tribal governments. 
So we have taken a sample number of tribes with respect to this year's distribution, about 20, on this chart. I may say that this is not one of these telescoped graphs that only works between No. 100 and No. 200. This graph goes from zero to $2,452. Tribal allocation per person to the Pequot Tribe in Connecticut from this year's distribution is $2,452. That is the tribe with the most successful gaming operation in the United States. Unemployment in the Pequot Tribe is zero. 
At the other end of the scale, the Fond du Lac Tribe, which gets $24 per person in its TPA allocation, has 67-percent unemployment. 
This, of course, doesn't include anything like all the tribes in the United States. I think it is a fair sampling, and any Member who desires to know where on this scale a tribe in his or her State falls can get that information through us. But you have a range of between $24 per capita and $2,452 per capita--a range of 100 to 1. The net result of failing to deal with that issue this year is that the ratio will be greater in 1998 in the bill we are voting on, it will be greater than it is at the present time. 
The original formula, I think, dates from sometime in the 1930's. Under those economic circumstances, having no relation to the present day, these tribes' governing authorities, of course, have various powers. Some provide more services than others do. But nonetheless, each year's change has made this system worse and is exacerbated. 
I will show you the same chart in a slightly different form, Mr. President. This form works from the Rosebuds in the Dakotas, which have the highest unemployment, 95 percent, down to the Pequots that have zero. In other words, to the best of our ability to determine need--because we don't have all of the figures, unemployment figures have to be a shorthand here for need--the most needy tribe gets $225 per capita. Again, the Pequots, $2,400. But if we don't want to take that one, let's take this one in Alabama; it is $1,195. 
Interestingly enough, the second highest distribution here is to the tribe that has the second highest unemployment. But the obvious import of these charts is that there is simply no relationship whatsoever--no relationship whatsoever--between the need, the economic poverty, the unemployment on a given Indian reservation and the distribution of moneys to the governing body of that institution from the Federal Government pursuant to these TPA's. 
One further point, of course, in connection with this question about treaties, most of the tribes in the United States are not treaty tribes. The Senator from Alaska referred to the fact that by fiat, the administration created, I think, a couple of hundred new tribes in Alaska, none of which are treaty tribes, but all of which, by that administrative action, will in a year or so fall into this kind of distribution of money. So the distribution has nothing to do with whether or not tribes are treaty tribes or nontreaty tribes. The tribes really don't have anything to say about the issue. 
We are distributing the money at the present time in a manner that is highly irrational. As a consequence, Mr. President, Senator Stevens and I have authored a letter dated today to the Comptroller General of the United States in the General Accounting Office, asking for a General Accounting Office study of the system I have described here, how we got to that system and how we can do better. 
Our request does, of course, include in it a request to the GAO to make a determination, not only of the needs of the tribes, but of their ability to meet those needs with their own resources. We may well learn from the GAO that even it cannot answer that question, because the tribes will not release a sufficient degree of information for us to make an intelligent decision. Then we will be told what kind of legislation is necessary so that Congress can deal with this matter in a rational fashion.

Mr. GORTON. I do want to say this, Mr. President. A number of compliments have been made about the way in which Members deal with issues that are highly controversial and on which they have great differences of opinion. I say, with respect to every one of those who have spoken here today, that I have gotten from each of them the greatest consideration, even when they have disagreed with me. Each of them holds his views as firmly as I do and as significantly as I do. 
The chairman of the committee has agreed, and will speak to that later, to dealing with a specific bill on the other subject. I haven't asked him to deal with this subject in his committee, but I rather suspect that he is going to wish to do so in order to be able to deal rationally and intelligently with this issue as well. 
So I have not gained the goal that I have set for myself when I was writing this bill to make substantive changes, but we are going to be able to vote these issues intelligently in the course of the next year in a way that has not been done in this Congress, certainly since I first arrived here in 1981 and probably for some time before that. 
I believe the debate on this issue is long overdue, Mr. President. I am persuaded, quite persuaded, that we can't engage in it in its full substantive fashion at the present time, for lack of information, and that what we are doing here is going to give us a greater ability to make our points at some time in the future. 
For their cooperation in seeing to it that we are moving forward on this issue, I thank each one of them, and we will be back here, I suspect, at some time in the future to debate this and the other issue more on its merits. Because the other issue is distinct from this one, I hope as soon as others who wish to speak on it have spoken, we will adopt the proposal, the amendment proposed by the Senator from Colorado, and then move on to the second one, and I will have a set of different remarks on that one.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, section 120 of the bill is a section that conditioned tribal priority allocations on the abandonment of a doctrine called sovereign immunity on the part of Indian tribes. There has been much said during the course of the day about justice, about simple justice, about there being more important concerns than the letter of the law. With that proposition, I find myself in agreement. And the proposal with respect to sovereign immunity was aimed at just precisely that goal--simple justice. 
In fact, Mr. President, there is a letter to the editor in the Washington Post today that goes under the title of `Simple Justice.' 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gorton-wa-7-19970916</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. The simple justice referred to in this article is the death of an 18-year-old high school student in an automobile accident in the lower Yakima Valley in the State of Washington. That accident, according to the father of the boy and the police agencies, took place when a Yakima tribal policeman ran a red light in a pursuit and broadsided the pickup being driven by the young man and killed him. 
The Yakima Tribe, the employer of that police officer, cannot be sued because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In other words, there is no State or Federal court in which the father, the author of this letter, can seek simple justice. He is absolutely precluded by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Now, if that police vehicle had belonged to the Yakima County sheriff's office, a suit could have been brought against Yakima County. If it had belonged to the Washington State Patrol, the father could have brought a lawsuit against the State of Washington--but not against the Yakima Tribal Council, the employer of that police officer. 
The Yakima Tribal Council states that the facts are somewhat different and that perhaps the police officer was not negligent. Neither you nor I, Mr. President, nor any Member of this body can be certain of those facts. But it is for exactly that reason that we set up courts in the United States, so that there could be a neutral body to make that determination and to reward damages where a judge and a jury felt damages were due. 
So when we discuss this question of tribal immunity, we aren't dealing with an abstraction, we are dealing with a very real question of justice involving very real people and involving responsibilities that are undertaken by every other governmental corporation in the United States. 
During the course of the debate over sovereign immunity, we have also heard, as one of the principal defenses, that it is created by these 367 treaties with Indian tribes. Unlike the debate on the previous question, a treaty-created right of financial support, I can't put a display behind me here showing a treaty and what it does to deal with tribal immunity because, bluntly, there isn't a word about sovereign immunity in any one of those 367 treaties. The reason is not surprising. Governmental immunity from lawsuits is not a concept that traces from that relationship. It is a doctrine of English common law that you could not sue the king, a common law inherited by the United States upon our Declaration of Independence in 1776, and abandoned, in most part, by the Government of the United States, by the governments of varying States, and through them by local governments all across the United States. One of the most recent statements of a Member of the Supreme Court on sovereign immunity is Justice Stevens, in 1991: 
The doctrine of sovereign immunity is founded upon an anachronistic fix. In my opinion, all governments, Federal, State, and tribal, should generally be accountable for their illegal conduct. 
And, of course, Mr. President, we never, under our system of judgment, allow the determination of whether or not something is illegal to be made by the person accused of illegality. We use an independent court system for that determination. The Supreme Court has dealt very specifically with the question of where the authority to make that determination about Indian tribal sovereign immunity is lodged. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist, in 1991, at the end of a series of cases on this subject, wrote: 
Congress has always been at liberty to dispense with such tribal immunity or to limit it. 
It is not a matter contained in any treaty. It is a matter that the Constitution of the United States of America lodges right here in the Congress of the United States. 
Now, I have agreed to the amendment that was just accepted because the Senator from Colorado, the Senator from Hawaii, and others have also graciously agreed that a subject that, for all practical purposes, has not previously been taken up by the Committee on Indian Affairs will in fact be taken up. 
I will, in the next few days or weeks, introduce a bill on sovereign immunity. They have agreed that there will be a series of hearings in which we will hear from victims of sovereign immunity, like the author of this letter, and from many others, and hear the justification of the various tribes for the retention of this anachronistic concept. They have also agreed that we will have a markup and a vote on such a proposal in the committee. 
My friend, the Senator from New Mexico, who is not here now, who vociferously and successfully argued for the removal of this section from this bill, has said, as he just did a few moments ago, that he feels that there may be real room, in connection with this doctrine, for changes, for some removal of that tribal immunity, even if not a total abandonment of it. I find that to be a most encouraging statement. I hope he reflects on others of his own view. The particular example that he has used is one that is pretty close to home, because as long ago as 1981 when I was attorney general of the State of Washington, I was involved in a lawsuit in which the Supreme Court of the United States made the judgment that Indian tribal smoke shops were required to collect the State's cigarette tax on the sale of cigarettes to non-Indians and to remit them to the State. It is curious that now we are debating actively just how much more we should pile on in the way of cigarette taxes in order to discourage smoking. 
But in the 17 years since the Supreme Court made that decision, a decision renewed in another case in the Supreme Court of the United States just a few years ago, Indian tribes have systematically and successfully ignored the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States and have refused to collect those cigarette taxes, and sell cheap cigarettes, often to minors, without collecting the State sales tax, and to successfully defy the Supreme Court because the smoke shops are considered tribal enterprises and the State taxing authorities can't sue to enforce the collection of those taxes because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. 
Just what justification we are going to get in these hearings for defying decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States and selling cheap cigarettes in the year 1997 and 1998 I am not sure about. I am going to be very interested in listening to that argument. We are talking about fairness here. We are talking about taxes that support the schools to which members of the tribe go. We are talking about a tax system that creates fair competition between sellers who hold that tribal immunity and those who do not. And, in a third area, we need to examine whether or not the ordinary forms of contract law ought to allow the enforcement of contracts, as against a claim of tribal immunity preventing a determination as to whether a contract has been violated or not. 
Those are three areas. I don't know that they are necessarily exclusive, and probably the considerations in each one of them may be different. 
Should States be allowed to enforce the collection of taxes that the Supreme Court says they have lawfully imposed? Should persons alleging violations of contract be able to go into a court to get a fair and equitable determination of whether a contract has been violated? Should the victim of negligence, or even an intentional harm in an automobile accident, or an assault, or the like, be able to seek redress in the courts of his or her State, or his or her Federal system, against an Indian tribe under pretty much the same circumstances in which they can seek that redress against any other governmental entity in the United States? 
The Supreme Court, Mr. President, has said the buck stops here. It is up to us to make that decision. We have not even talked about it for 20, 30, or 40 years. 
I think it is a major step forward that we will in fact talk about it. I suspect that it will still be a controversial issue, though it may be that the Senator from New Mexico has come up with a way for us to say, `Well, perhaps we are not going to go all the way; perhaps we will try to deal with areas which are really quite open and shut, and see whether or not it works to the administration of justice; whether or not it does undercut any kind of tribal right of self-determination.' 
That offer, as well as the generous statements from the Senator from Hawaii, and the Senator from Colorado, I greatly welcome. And I think we can deal with this in an orderly fashion of committee hearings and committee action. 
I now think perhaps for the first time we have some hope that we may not only be able to talk about the issue but to come to some kind of an accommodation in which we meet somewhere in the middle of the road--hopefully we will not get hit by a car on the way--and see whether or not we can't move forward on this. 
So, I agree with the amendment of the Senator from Colorado which has just been agreed to. I thank him for his agreement to move forward on an issue on which he feels strongly, just as I do. But that, of course, is the way in which we deal with controversial issues, and I look forward to the next round. 
Mr. President, I think we have exhausted this subject. With respect to the bill as a whole, we will return I believe to the debate over the various amendments on the National Endowment for the Arts. The majority leader informs me that he in the strongest possible terms wishes to complete all action on this bill by adjournment tomorrow. Once Members who wish to speak to the National Endowment for the Arts, or any other issue, come to the floor and do so, we will have a further opportunity this evening. 
There is an amendment on forest roads to be proposed by Senator Bryan of Nevada, which I understand will be proposed early tomorrow, which will be highly controversial. And this will require a vote. The Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, and the other Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, may well have settled the controversy involving them, and others. 
So I am not certain, on the Bryan amendment and the various amendments on the National Endowment for the Arts, that there are any others that will require rollcall votes. If there are, I urge Senators, or their staffs, to notify us and come to the floor and discuss them. 
We need to pass this bill. We need to get it into a conference committee. There are many controversial differences with the House bill. 
With that, Mr. President, and the request of anyone who wants to say anything tonight to say it, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment is technical. In response to the growing backlog of unmet need for replacement and repair of BIA schools, the committee recommended that tribes be allowed to use their Tribal Priority Allocations funds for replacement and repair of schools if they wish. The technical amendment we are recommending today would clarify that, if a Tribe decides to use its TPA funds for the improvement, repair, or replacement of a school, that work must be preapproved by the Secretary of the Interior. In addition, future work must be completed with TPA or non-Federal Tribal funding. The Bureau correctly noted after the committee included the original language that, absent such conditions, it cannot currently meet the needs as they exist now. We are attempting to give Tribes some options; however, we do not wish to simply add to the need.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I share many of the sentiments expressed by my colleague from Arkansas. I believe that he has brought up an important issue, an issue that should not be decided simply by fiat from the President and the President's administration, but one that ought to be carefully considered here by the Congress. 
Without having read every word of his amendment, I am inclined to tell him that I agree with it. I must tell him at the same time, in this relatively empty Senate Chamber, as he knows, his amendment will be quite controversial. I am certain it will require a rollcall. For that reason, I am particularly happy that he did bring it up tonight so that other Members can consider its provisions so that it can be debated further tomorrow. But while I had said not too long ago that I did not know of a number of other amendments that will require a rollcall, I will have to amend that statement and say that I think that the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas will require a rollcall. 
I do hope that he and others will speak on it tomorrow. I just say that I think the statement he has made is correct, that this is an issue in which the Congress should be involved. 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are now on the Interior appropriations bill once again. I believe that the first vote on that bill will be on the Ashcroft-Helms amendment to strike the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts. There has been discussion of several other amendments relating to that endowment. I believe it appropriate to continue that debate until the cloture vote at noon. I know that the majority leader hopes, and I hope, that shortly after we get back on the Interior appropriations bill, after our FDA vote, that we will begin to vote on amendments relating to the National Endowment for the Arts. In any event, that is the subject at the present time. I invite all Members who are interested in any of the amendments on the National Endowment for the Arts to come to the floor and speak on that subject between now and noon.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we are less than 30 minutes from moving on to another subject, the cloture vote on the bill relating to the Food and Drug Administration. If I may, I would like to summarize where we are on this interesting and multifaceted debate on the National Endowment for the Arts. 
The Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, who is present on the floor, and Senator Helms have proposed an amendment that will terminate the National Endowment for the Arts in much the same way as the House of Representatives has already voted. 
I hope that we will be able to vote on that amendment in not too great a time after the completion of whatever the majority leader seeks to do with respect to the Food and Drug Administration bill. The Senator from Missouri may very well tell us how much more time he thinks he needs on his amendment. 
After that, logically the next amendment would be that proposed by the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], which would also close down the National Endowment for the Arts but would transfer the money to, I believe, the National Park Service for the preservation of historic American treasures. 
The next proposal would be that of the Senators from Alabama and Arkansas who would essentially block grant the entire appropriation for the National Endowment to the States; following that the proposal by the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], that would have 25 percent, roughly, governed by the National Endowment for the Arts here and 75 percent block granted for the States. 
Those are the proposals that have been discussed on the floor at some length yesterday afternoon and this morning. I hope that we can reach an orderly method for voting on each of those amendments so that the will of the Senate with respect to the National Endowment will be made known. 
I regret deeply to say that my partner on this bill, Senator Byrd, is indisposed today and will not be able to be here at all, something he regrets. He hopes that maybe at least some of these votes could be postponed until tomorrow. I will have to leave that up to the majority leader, who I think wants to move forward as quickly as we possibly can. 
It is appropriate now, however, I think, for me to state my own view at least on the four amendments that are in front of us. My views reflect those of the Appropriations Committee and, most particularly, my subcommittee. I believe the National Endowment for the Arts does in fact play a constructive role in culture in the United States. I believe that reforms in the last 2 or 3 years have cut down tremendously on some of the truly objectionable grants which were rightly objected to by the vast majority of the American people. 
So with respect to the first two amendments, I will vote no. I also am unable in my own mind to feel that we would somehow deal more sensitively if all of these grants were decentralized to State arts commissions. 
Finally, I find myself somewhat in sympathy with the proposal 
of the Senator from Texas. I believe that perhaps a greater focusing, but not a universal focusing, on State and regional arts organizations may well be appropriate but that there are also grants that are appropriately national in nature and that many of the institutional grantees, while they may be located in a particular city or a particular State, have an impact on the arts that goes far beyond the locale of their principal office, their museum, their symphony orchestra or their opera company. 
Because, however, the Ashcroft-Helms position has governed the House of Representatives, my inclination is to vote against all of these amendments that change the present system simply because we will have to take into account the views of the House of Representatives in a conference committee, a conference committee that I think is likely at least to come out with a proposal that is perhaps closer to that of the Senator from Texas than any other that I have heard at this point. 
So at the present time, unless I am persuaded to the contrary, Mr. President, I am going to suggest to the Members of this body that they leave the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts contained in the bill as it is before us now untouched and discuss the very important questions that all of them have raised with the House of Representatives that has taken a quite different view in a conference committee. With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader has already pointed out what he hopes will be the schedule in connection with this and other bills during the course of the week. As he said, there will not be any votes on any amendments to this bill today, but through most of last week, we expressed our views that today would present a wonderful opportunity to debate what may very well 
be the most controversial of all of the elements in the bill: the appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
The notices that I have received in connection with amendments include more on that subject, those which are to be more liberal with the National Endowment than the bill has been and those wishing to be more conservative or to restrict its use or even to abolish its appropriation, have stated that they will produce such amendments. 
We have asked as many of those Members to be present sometime during today's session of the Senate as possible. Most of them on Friday indicated that they would be able to be here today. Obviously, as the majority leader said, today gives them an opportunity to debate their amendments and to state their views on the National Endowment for the Arts in full and at leisure, where tomorrow may be somewhat more hectic. 
So I hope that all of them who are in or around the Capitol and the staffs of all of those Senators who have an interest in the subject will urge them to come to the floor, offer their amendments, speak to the National Endowment for the Arts, complete much of the debate on the subject today so that we can vote tomorrow on that subject. 
Having said that, Mr. President, noticing that no such Senators are present today, I have remarks on a subject of importance--vital importance--to the people of the State of Washington, one that has a high local profile and one that has also been of interest to the administration to the extent that it made a specific reference to it in its budget presentation this year. So I will ask the indulgence of the President and will make my remarks with respect to the Elwha River dams at this point. 
Mr. President, during the course of the last week, I said publicly that I would consider supporting removal of one of two dams on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Specifically, with important conditions attached, I can support legislation that would allow the removal of the smaller downriver dam. As this represents something of a change in my position, it warrants a more detailed explanation on my part--what this new position means and, just as importantly, what it does not mean. 
For many years, national environmental groups, the Clinton administration, much of the media in the Pacific Northwest, and many Northwest elected officials have pushed for the removal of both dams on the Elwha River. 
In 1992, I reluctantly supported legislation to begin the process of having the Government study and acquire both of these dams with an eye toward removing them at some time in the future. Even so, it is no surprise to anyone from Washington State to hear me say today that I have been less than excited about this proposal. While I always have been enthusiastic about the Federal Government's purchasing these two dams from a local paper company, I have been skeptical that Elwha River dam removal will provide significant benefit to our salmon resources. 
For years, I have been told that 100-pound salmon used to fill the Elwha River, and that if we just removed these two dams, those big salmon would return. 
While that is the proponents' most compelling argument--perhaps their only argument--for removal, I fear that it is one with the promises that have caused us to spend some $3 billion on the Columbia River, with little discernible effect, except on our power costs. If dams are the reason that there are no 100-pound salmon swimming in the Elwha River, why are there no huge salmon in dozens of other Olympic Peninsula rivers that have never been dammed? Will we waste our money on the Elwha as we have on the Columbia? 
As you can tell, I have severe doubts about the wisdom of knocking down either of these dams under the guise of benefit to the salmon. I am quite certain, however, that there are other clear costs to their removal. Taxpayers must pay the huge costs of that removal. Power generation will be lost, and in the case of 
the Elwha River Dams, serious questions remain about potential damage to the city of Port Angeles' water supply. As I weigh these costs against the potential benefits to salmon, I have almost always sided against dam removal. 
Unfortunately, the issue isn't as simple as a cost-benefit analysis. If it were, the costs of removing the two dams would certainly outweigh the potential benefit to the salmon. But, as I say, it is not just that simple anymore. There is a wild card to this issue that makes me nervous, a wild card that makes me want to act now, a wild card that, if played, could have a devastating effect on the Port Angeles community. 
The desire of the Interior Secretary to tear down a dam, a proposal he has advocated consistently, together with the very real and growing threat that a Federal judge, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, may order the removal of Elwha River Dams without congressional approval, present real threats to the community, are beyond our control and cannot be ignored. 
A court- or agency-ordered removal may well impose all of the costs of removing the dams on the local community. Jobs would be destroyed, and Port Angeles' supply of clean drinking water would be threatened. The risk of court or agency action is too great and will leave the local community in a terrible position if a judge or Washington, DC, bureaucrat were to suddenly decide that he or she could take charge of this issue. 
The lower Elwha River Dam produces only a modest amount of power, about a third of that produced by the upper Elwha River Dam, and a minuscule amount in comparison to our productive Snake and Columbia River Dams. In addition, Mr. President, the lower Elwha River Dam is in bad physical shape. 
So, if Congress acts properly, we can remove the wild card from the deck and assure an important level of community protection. As a consequence, my support for this lower dam's removal is conditioned on legislated protection for Port Angeles' water supply and protection for the jobs created by the local mill. No legislation to remove an Elwha River Dam will pass the U.S. Senate without these protections, except over my strong objections, while I am a Member. 
Mr. President, I must tell you that while I believe the course of action I am taking on the issue is the right one, I am disturbed by what is forcing me to take this step in such a hasty manner. I am driven by the threat of court action, or the possibility that the Federal Government might just step in and remove the dams on its own with no thought given to the concerns of the local community. 
While I have come to this agonizing decision after years of internal and public debate about the fate of these dams, my decision has been driven by the unilateral activism this administration has demonstrated when it comes to complex environmental issues. 
Based upon the Clinton administration's actions last year in Utah, can anyone not justifiably worry that a similar overreaching Federal Government authority will take place on the Elwha River? Is there any doubt that when this administration is faced with deciding between the desires of national environmental organizations and the needs of local communities, it always sides with the national environmental groups? 
This is not an easy decision for me--it is made difficult by the dozens of meetings I've had with people most affected by this issue. I've listened to hundreds of local people who live near the Elwha River express their concerns with dam removal and what it means to the local community. 
To be fair, I am also impressed by the work of a broad-based coalition of residents who have studied the issue and who may have originated the proposal to deal with the two dams separately, in a staged process. I want to commend the Elwha Citizens' Advisory Committee for its work on this issue, and all of the hard work that went into developing the committee's report, `The Elwha River and Our Community's Future.' 
I've also listened to the concerns of my constituents in eastern Washington, who while not immediately impacted by the removal of the Elwha River dams, are watching this debate closely because of their concern that something similar could happen on the Columbia or Snake Rivers. 
I want to speak specifically to those people right now, Mr. President, and to anyone who might attempt to use my position on this issue as a justification for removing other dams in the Pacific Northwest, or as asserting that I believe the idea to be worth considering. 
Because of the controversial nature of this issue, I think it is important that people understand what my position on the Elwha River dams does not mean. Some groups and elected officials support removal of Elwha River dams as a first step, a practice run, toward removing Columbia River system hydroelectric dams. Those who want to make a habit of dam removal should understand this proposition: I will never support their proposals to remove Snake or Columbia River dams--never. 
Our Northwest forebears built for us the world's most productive hydroelectric system. It is our great economic legacy and continues today as part of the reason families in the Northwest enjoy the Nation's lowest power rates. This clean and renewable resource does not pollute. 
These dams also irrigate productive farmland in Idaho, eastern Washington, and eastern Oregon. These dams have created an enormous and productive aquatic highway that moves our agricultural products to our ports. These dams save Portland, Oregon, and hundreds of other communities from disastrous flooding. 
Of course, the Columbia River System dams exact an environmental price. They hurt our salmon runs. That damage was felt primarily in the 1930's and 1940's. Since the last Columbia River dam was constructed we continued to have large and healthy salmon runs. The last decade's alarming decline in Columbia River salmon runs obviously has more profound causes than our hydroelectric facilities alone. 
We can do more for salmon especially by acting in a more intelligent and coordinated way to restore our Northwest salmon resources. But the costs associated with removing dams on the Snake or Columbia Rivers will always dwarf the potential benefit to salmon. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I intend this year to work with my colleagues to complete acquisition of the two Elwha River dams with dollars from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In addition, I will introduce legislation authorizing the removal of the lower Elwha River dam. But that bill will also contain three vital conditions I believe to be absolutely necessary at the same time: 
First, a 12-year study of the impact of lower dam removal on fish populations before any consideration of removing the upper dam; 
Second, a guaranteed hold harmless for the Pot Angeles water supply; 
Third, no dam on the Columbia or Snake Rivers System can be removed, breached, or modified in a way that substantially destroys its ability to produce power, and provide irrigation, transportation or flood control without the prior authorization of Congress. 
I think it is vitally important to America's taxpayers that the first condition be met. This is a very costly proposition--the Government estimates that it will cost as much as $60 million to remove the lower Elwha River dam. My sources tell me that those estimates are way too low and that the final cost could be much higher. Of course, no one really knows what this project might cost, which is why only the lower dam should come down now. 
I want to be sure that when the inevitable day comes when national environmental groups and editorial writers push for removal of the upper dam, they have a true idea of what it will cost and whether the removal of the dam will actually work. The best way to do that is to study what happens when the lower dam is removed. We will be able to find out exactly what it costs to take out this dam, and, even better, we can find out once and for all whether removing a dam will actually bring back salmon. 
I believe my second condition is only fair to the people of Port Angeles, and is one that should be met with little, or no, opposition. 
As for my third condition, I think it is vital to my constituents in eastern Washington, and to my colleagues who represent Montana, Idaho, and eastern Oregon, that we in the Congress, and in the administration make the important statement that the dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers are not to be touched in the immediate future, unless Congress has debated the issue and agrees. 
Radical revisionists in the media, national environmental groups, and in the administration are actually talking more and more about tearing down 1 of the 11 dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Just last week, a prominent Northwest newspaper had a lengthy story about the dam removal movement, and how the proposition for tearing down a dam on the Columbia River System was gaining momentum. As you can imagine, even talking about this subject causes huge concern in the communities that depend upon the river for their livelihoods. 
It also causes a profound concern to this Senator, which is why I think it is important that we nip such a proposal in the bud, and nip it now. This legislation is the most appropriate place to do so. 
With that, Mr. President, I have completed my thoughts on the policy of this proposal. Let me now discuss the practicality of getting this done in a reasonable amount of time. 
Many of the advocates for Elwha River Dam removal think Congress should be able to fund the entire project out of the remaining money in the land and water conservation fund. Because I am chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, these people believe that I can simply tell my colleagues that I intend to take $18.5 million of this money to complete acquisition, and then grab another $60 million for removal of lower dam, leaving the remaining dollars--after the $315 million for the acquisition of the Headwaters Forest in California and the New World Mine in Montana, and the $100 million in State acquisition grants--for division among the other 49 States. 
To those back home who believe that it is either fair or possible that I should be able to do that with a snap of my fingers, I suggest a lack of understanding of how Congress works. 
Today we start in earnest on working through this year's Interior appropriations bill. In this bill, I have dealt with Washington State projects in a fair and generous fashion. We have been able to fund an additional $2 million for the Forest Legacy Program, $8 million for land acquisition in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, and an additional $3 million for forest health research at the Pacific Northwest Research Station. 
Other priority projects which have been funded in the Senate Interior appropriations bill and directly benefit Washington State include: An increase of $3 million over the President's budget request for trail maintenance in the Pacific Northwest; $2.5 million to develop a visitors center, interpretive center, and educational center at the Vancouver National Historic Reserve; $500,000 in support of Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail activities; $2,452,000 to replace the Paradise employee dorm at Mount Ranier National Park; $750,000 for regional fisheries enhancement; $840,000 for construction of a trailhead and information station at the Steigerwald National Wildlife Refuge; and $275,000 for the North Cascades National Park to fulfill its obligations under various settlement agreements relating to the relicensing of hydroelectric projects. 
I feel comfortable with what I have accomplished for my State, and proud of that work. I must admit that I would not feel comfortable simply demanding from my colleagues that the remaining acquisition funds come out of the land and water conservation fund without a strong statement of support from the administration and the entire Congress. 
I believe such a statement is needed so that my colleagues from around the Nation can understand why their priority items are being placed behind spending an additional $18 million to complete the acquisition of the Elwha River Dams, and another $60 million to remove the lower dam. And Washingtonians may well ask themselves if they are willing to give up new projects like those I have already discussed for several years in order to put all of our fair share into Elwha River Dam removal. 
Second, there is little chance that funds for removal of the lower dam will come from the land and water conservation fund. Frankly, I would be embarrassed to ask for such a sum. Out of fairness to other States around the country, I believe the funds for removal of the lower dam need to move through other channels, or at least be specifically authorized to come out of a land and water conservation fund primarily for land acquisition rather than capital improvements. 
Just as the original legislation sponsored by Senator Brock Adams needed the authorization of the Energy Committee and the entire Congress, the extraordinary level of funding requested for this project needs to be authorized by Congress as well. My legislation will propose just that. And I hope that this legislation will be considered as swiftly as possible. 
I realize that back home I will be criticized for not grabbing all of the funding for this project in this year's appropriations process. To those critics, I suggest an absence of rational thought and fairness. 
Washington State does quite well under this year's Interior appropriations bill. Funding the removal of the lower Elwha River Dam would dramatically tip the scales away from fairness, and rightly cause justifiable and successful opposition from my colleagues around the country who have vital programs in their States that need funding. 
All of us want to get the most for our States, and in our hearts, we believe that every request for our State is an urgent priority, but in our minds we also know that we can't fund every request. That means we must balance our desire to help our States with the reality that Congress can only fund so many projects for each State. 
As I said at the beginning of this debate on Friday, Mr. President, I had 1,800 requests from the 100 Senators in this body for projects in which they had a great interest, the huge majority of which were home-State projects. 
That is the reality I face as I work to resolve this difficult issue involving the Elwha River dams. I know it is a reality that critics don't want to hear or acknowledge, but the simple truth is this--full funding of acquisition and removal this year is highly unlikely, and impossible without setting aside almost all other important Washington State projects, and something I am not willing to do. 
Therefore, the best solution is to complete acquisition this year, and for that I need the administration to state publicly that this remains one of its top priorities. At the same time, I will start the process for removing the lower dam by introducing legislation for consideration by the Energy Committee, the administration, and the rest of Congress. 
Mr. President, I thank you for giving me this time this morning to discuss an issue important for my home State. In summary, I guess I would finish by saying that on this issue of Northwest dam removal, tally me this way: `once, with conditions.' 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas in proceeding in this fashion. As I announced previously, there are a number of amendments we expect with respect to the National Endowment for the Arts. I believe that the proposal by the Senator from Texas will be a perfecting amendment, that she is attempting to improve it. 
The logic in dealing with these amendments will be to deal with those amendments that strike or substantially cut funding for the endowment first. And so the willingness of the Senator from Texas to speak, as I am sure she will quite eloquently, to her proposition but not to introduce it yet will facilitate dealing with the matter when it comes to a vote in a more logical way.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do not think it would be possible for a Member of this body to defend more eloquently the mission of the National Endowment for the Arts or the place that the arts in the broadest sense of that term play in our society than we have just heard from the Senator from Texas. 
From the beginning of the debate over this issue she has taken a consistently supportive position but not a position that simply supports the status quo blindly. She helped draft the conditions a year or 2 or 3 years ago that prohibited the National Endowment for the Arts from making a broad range of individual grants that were the source of most of what the vast majority of the American people regarded as outrageous misuses of the taxpayers' money. 
And here today, she does not defend the status quo--though, essentially, the status quo is what is proposed by this bill in its present form--but is attempting to strengthen the Endowment by decentralizing the granting process to a significant degree, and by spreading it in a way that she feels is more equitable across all of the States and jurisdictions of the United States. 
So this is one of the amendments that is a friendly amendment, one can say, and it was for that reason that I asked her to defer formally introducing it until we could hear from the opponents of the Endowment itself and deal with the several amendments on this subject in logical fashion. 
As the Senator from Texas knows, the committee bill that is on the floor at the present time simply makes a very modest--probably less than inflation--increase in the Endowment, maintains essentially the same conditions that have been imposed on it over the last 2 or 3 years, but does not attempt to change the structure of the way in which those grants are made. I think that the proposal of the Senator from Texas is likely to be considered very carefully and thoughtfully by her colleagues here on the floor and, if not here on the floor, perhaps in a conference committee where, as all Senators are quite well aware, we will be faced with a House position that is essentially to abolish the National Endowment, and which will almost certainly require us to make some changes in the proposal that is here before the Senate in order to assure an acceptable compromise. 
So, without at this point taking a position on the specific amendment proposed by the Senator, I do want to say that I am convinced that it is a constructive contribution to a very important debate.

Mr. GORTON. As manager of the bill, I say to my colleague from North Carolina, I asked both the previous two Senators who spoke, and Senator Hutchison who preceded them, not to introduce their block grant amendments because it seemed to me most logical that the proposal of the Senator from North Carolina, which would effectively reflect the House position of abolishing an appropriation for the National Endowment for the Arts, logically ought to go first. So I believe the answer to the Senator's question is a committee amendment is the business and the amendment that the Senator from North Carolina proposes, I think, would be in order.

Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his eloquent statement. I know how important this project is to Senator DeWine. As he has stated, we have talked about this project on several occasions over the past 2 months, and I must confess that the Senator's enthusiasm for his project has rubbed off on this Senator. As my colleagues may know, the Senator from Ohio grew up not far from where the Wright Brothers made their dreams of powered flight a reality. It also is no secret that the legacy of the Wright Brothers is very much alive and well in my own State of Washington. 
Madam President, I want to assure the Senator from Ohio that he has convinced me of the merits of this effort to restore this important historical landmark in time for the centennial celebration of powered flight less than 6 years from now. I am strongly inclined to support his position in our inevitable conference with the House of Representatives on the subject. 
I also urge my friends from Ohio to keep me and the members of my subcommittee informed of his continued efforts and those of the Dayton community as it prepares for the celebration in the year 2003. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senate will be in session today only for the transaction of morning business. No rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. On Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. As announced, no rollcall votes will occur during Monday's session. The majority leader intends that the Senate conclude debate on the Interior bill by Tuesday. As a consequence, Members are encouraged to contact the managers of the bill to schedule floor action on any possible amendments on Monday or Tuesday. 
As Members are aware, this is the next to the last appropriations bill remaining for Senate consideration, so Members' cooperation is appreciated in the scheduling of floor action as we attempt to conclude action on both the Interior appropriations bill and the District of Columbia appropriations bill next week. As a result of this policy, the next rollcall vote will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration reform bill, which will occur on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Under rule XXII, all first-degree amendments to S. 830 must be filed by 1 p.m. on Monday. The majority leader thanks his colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, as manager of the Interior appropriations bill, I have spoken to a number of my colleagues with interest in the National Endowment for the Arts to express my views and those of Senator Stevens and the majority leader that to the maximum possible extent, amendments relating to the National Endowment for the Arts be presented and debated on Monday. With a single exception, all of the Members who I am aware of who may have such amendments have been contacted and have expressed their cooperation. But for the information of all Members on both sides of the aisle, Monday will provide a time at which the National Endowment for the Arts can be debated at leisure without time constraints or the interference of other matters. 
So I do hope that those Members who have an interest in expressing their views on the subject will come to the floor of the Senate on Monday afternoon and let their views be known to other Members of the Senate. 
This is not to say, of course, that other amendments will not be in order on Monday, as they will be. We are aware of the possibility of amendments by Senators Helms and Ashcroft that would terminate the National Endowment for the Arts in the way that the House of Representatives voted to do; additional amendments by Senator Helms with respect to content restrictions; a potential amendment by Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, together with Senators Sessions and Abraham on block granting most or all of the funds for the National Endowment for the Arts; an amendment by Senator Hutchison of Texas to restructure the grant process of NEA; an amendment by Senator Jeffords, as the chairman of the authorizing committee for the Endowment, to deal with the committee's authorization proposal as a part of this appropriations debate; and the possibility that Senator Cochran may wish to clarify the definition of arts education. That is not to say all these amendments will, in fact, be adopted. It is not to say there are not others. I may report that there seems to be more interest in debating this issue in a number of different guises than there is of any other part of the Interior appropriations bill. I, obviously, will be here for the day. I hope I am accompanied by the great majority of those who wish to speak on the issue. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

No State will lose money under the terms of this amendment. Every State will gain money under the terms of this amendment, because the administrative costs, amounting to more than a billion dollars, will no longer be withheld by the Department of Education in Washington, DC, but will be transferred to the local school districts.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I find it regrettable but not surprising that the expressions against the amendment which we just adopted are based on the proposition that all knowledge with respect to educational priorities is lodged right here among the 100 Members of this body, and, if not here, certainly no closer to our students than the Department of Education's bureaucrats here in Washington, DC; that if we are to allow local school board members, teachers, and parents to decide how they would like to spend the money on the education of their children setting different priorities in different school districts, they will, of course, waste the money, ignore our children, and use it to build swimming pools. 
Well, Mr. President, I wonder why it is that the voters are so wise when they pick us and so foolish when they pick local school board members. That is the real issue here. Do we trust the people who are running our schools to run them properly, to care for the education of their children and to do a better job than Washington, DC, bureaucrats? 
Fifty-one of you voted that we trust our educators.

<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased, together with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, to bring before the Senate the fiscal year 1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. 
This bill provides $13.755 billion in net budget authority for the agencies and programs under the jurisdiction of the Interior subcommittee--a reduction of $46 million from the administration's amended budget request. In spite of this reduction, I believe that this bill protects the high priorities of the administration, while also reflecting the priorities of this body. 
The Interior bill, Mr. President, is a fascinating mix of 91 appropriations accounts covering more than 40 individual bureaus in four different Cabinet Departments and numerous independent agencies. 
When I first became chairman of the subcommittee, I asked the staff to break down the bill into its major components so that I could understand better the competing demands within the bill. What we came up with was this chart behind me, Mr. President. 
The chart breaks this bill into six functional categories--land management programs, Indian programs, science and minerals programs, energy programs, cultural programs, and the operation of the Interior Department office itself. 
Though many of the individual programs within these categories are small in simple dollar terms, most of them have direct and tangible impacts on the lives of average Americans. As such, they tend to have vocal constituencies. 
You will see, Mr. President, that within each of these six major functions, we have shown some of the breakdowns. The largest amount of money goes into land management programs. Those programs, in turn, fall into two separate departments. As the Forest Service, the largest single one of these programs, is within the Department of Agriculture, the others are within the Department of the Interior. They are in green on the left side of this chart. The second largest, by all odds, of the elements that are in this bill are Indian programs, primarily the Indian Health Service, and the general programs of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
Smaller amounts fall within the science and minerals programs. The most significant there is the United States Geological Survey. Energy programs within the purview of that Department include fossil energy research and development and energy conservation research and development. 
Finally, the cultural programs which may well occupy more of the passionate debate time on this floor than any of the others, include museums and the two national endowments. 
Finally, the very small graph line on the right is for the operation of the Department of Interior itself. An indication of how vocal the constituencies for this bill are is the fact that we on the subcommittee received more than 1,800 individual requests from Senators. Mr. President, 100 Senators and 1,800 requests for items in the Interior bill, the vast majority of which were for additions to the President's budget request. Within a subcommittee allocation that is actually somewhat smaller than the President's request, it has obviously been impossible to satisfy more than a fraction of these requests while still pressuring the ongoing base programs of the individual agencies shown in that chart. 
So the task of putting together the fiscal year 1998 bill was complicated by the completion of the balanced budget agreement. 
First, I need to report something that I have said frequently on the floor that I am a strong supporter of that agreement, from the very beginning of negotiations through the deliberations of the Budget Committee, through its final passage and implementation. I also recognize that the agreement makes available more discretionary spending for the Interior bill than I think we would have had in its absence. 
That said, the agreement explicitly provided that four programs in the Interior bill be funded at the request level that the President made for the budget: The operation of the National Park System, the Park Service land acquisition program and State assistance, the restoration of the Everglades, and tribal priority allocations within the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
In the absence of a budget agreement I would only be honest to say I would not have recommended that all of these programs be funded at the budget request level. Personally, I believe there are other programs covered by the bill that are of at least that degree of priority or of a higher priority. Even so, the bill before you does fund these programs at levels consistent with the budget agreement. Having reached the agreement, having voted for the agreement in principle, Mr. President, it seems appropriate to me that we keep the promises that were included within it. I intend to do so to the best of my ability. Nevertheless, the effect of protecting these programs is that there was less funding available for other agencies and activities funded in the bill. 
The budget agreement also created a $700 million reserve fund for priority land acquisitions. That amount has been included in the bill and is in addition to the $242 million provided for specific land acquisition projects in the regular acquisition accounts. 
The budget agreement made no provision for the carrying costs of the lands to be acquired with the $700 million, nor for the payments in lieu of taxes that likely must be paid on these lands. While I believe that the $700 million might better be spent reducing the huge maintenance backlogs that already exist on Federal lands, essentially taking care of what we already have, my strong support for the budget agreement compelled me to include the $700 million in this bill. The House did not do so. Knowing how strongly Chairman Regula feels about this issue, I anticipate our discussion in conference on the subject will be a lively one, to say the least. 
Of the $700 million provided for land acquisition in title V, $250 million is set aside for the acquisition of the Headwaters Forest in California and $65 million is set aside for the acquisition of the New World Mine in Montana. Both of these appropriations remain subject to enactment of specific authorizing legislation. I have included the authorizing clause due to the magnitude of these two acquisitions, the complex structure of the acquisition agreement, and the fact that the agreements themselves were struck with very little congressional oversight or involvement. The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski], among others, has expressed to me a number of serious concerns and questions about each of these acquisitions. As chairman of the relevant authorizing committee, it is appropriate that he be given the opportunity to have his questions answered by the administration. I am confident he will work in good faith to draft appropriate authorizing legislation, and I understand that he intends to hold a hearing on this issue in the near future. 
The administration and many Members on the other side of the aisle wish to avoid the authorizing process entirely. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, made no such appropriation at all. 
It seems to me where we stand in this bill for the purposes of debating this bill here in the Senate, we are at the right stage. We should appropriate the $700 million. We should allow the authorizing committee to do its work on these two expensive, complicated, and vitally important acquisitions. 
Of the $700 million, an additional $100 million is provided specifically for the `stateside' grant program. As some of my colleagues may be aware, this is a program that was essentially terminated by the Appropriations Committee in the fiscal year 1996 bill. The Interior subcommittee's allocation was cut sharply that year and it was simply not possible to continue the stateside program while protecting the core Federal programs included in the bill. Furthermore, I suspect that continued funding constraints and the growing cost of maintaining Federal land and facilities make it unlikely that the stateside program will be resurrected in the context of any annual appropriations bill in the near future. 
I hope this one-time appropriation of $100 million, to be allocated over a 4-year period, will enable the authorizing committee to identify a permanent funding source for that stateside program. 
The remaining $285 million provided in title V of the bill is for Federal acquisition projects. The specific acquisition projects to be funded would be determined through discussions between Congress and the administration but no funds would be available until the project list is approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. This process will enable us to target these funds for acquisitions that protect the most critically threatened resources and that reduce the cost of lands management by eliminating problematic inholdings. I do not intend to use these funds to create new parks, forests or refuges. 
Now, for the land management agencies themselves, the bill 
includes a number of positive features. For the National Park Service, the bill fully funds the administration's budget request for operation of the National Park System. This results in a 1 percent across-the-board funding increase for all park units. In addition, the bill includes a $24.8 million increase for special needs parks, an increase of $8.1 million over the budget request. These funds will be used to staff new parks, address critical operating shortfalls at park units with high visitation and protect threatened park resources. 
For the Fish and Wildlife Service, the bill includes an increase of $33.2 million over the fiscal year 1997 level for the operation and maintenance of our Nation's fish and wildlife refuges. This amounts to a $20 million increase over the budget request. The increase will enable the service to make a dent in its growing maintenance backlog and to address critical operating shortfalls at selected refuges. 
The bill provides $1.135 billion for the Bureau of Land Management, an increase of more than $40 million over the comparable fiscal year 1997 funding level. The amount provided includes increases over fiscal year 1997 of $12.5 million for wildland fire preparedness, and $18.2 for fire operations and for payments in lieu of taxes. 
Total funding for the Forest Service is $2.495 billion, an increase of $133 million above the comparable fiscal year 1997 enacted amount. Funds have been provided to produce 3.8 billion board feet of timber, consisting of 2.525 billion board feet from `green' sales, and 1.275 billion board feet from salvage. The funding provided also includes a $33.4 million increase over the administration's request for forest health-related programs, including $21 million to reduce the severe potential for catastrophic fire on our national forest lands. Through language in the bill and report, the committee has taken steps to eliminate needless duplicate planning processes, and to increase Forest Service accountability for land management planning and implementation of the Columbia Basin ecosystem assessment and other ecoregion assessments. 
Within the area of programs for Native Americans, the bill provides $2.1 billion for the Indian Health Service. This funding level is $72.7 million over the fiscal year 1997 level and 4.7 million over the President's request. The committee's recommendation includes $35 million for uncontrollable fixed costs related largely to hospital and clinic personnel, an increase of $15 million over the budget request. This increase will allow the Indian health service to maintain current levels of service. 
As I already noted, it fully funds the President's request for tribal priority allocations at $757.4 million, consistent with the budget agreement. This represents an increase of $76.5 million over fiscal year 1997 levels. Tribal priority allocations now make up 49 percent of the bureau's operating budget. 
Within those tribal priority allocations, approximately 30 percent is distributed by formula based on tribes meeting criteria for the following programs: The Indian Child Welfare Act, new tribes, Johnson O'Malley education assistance, housing improvement, road maintenance, contract support, and welfare assistance. 
The committee has included report language directing the continued allocation of these funds based on qualification with specific criteria. 
The committee has also included language in section 118 of the bill that directs the Bureau of Indian affairs to develop and present to the Congress by January 1, 1998, its recommendations for the allocation of the tribal priority allocations funding based on tribal economic wealth and need. Currently, TPA funds are distributed to the tribes based on a historical methodology dating to the 1930's when we had many fewer recognized tribes and when circumstances were very much different for both the tribes and the Federal budget. This old funding plan was further corrupted in the 1960's through the 1980's when the base TPA funds for certain tribes were increased significantly. This provision and a revised version that will be offered as an amendment will be the subject of extensive debate during the consideration of the bill unless agreement on the provision can be reached, an agreement which now seems to be within the range of possibility. 
It is, however, based on the very simple premise in an area of severe fiscal constraints, the distribution of scarce funds for tribal governments should be based upon an objective assessment of relative need, not the political power of individual tribes or the arbitrary accumulation of individual funding decisions over past years. 
The committee has included language in section 120 of the bill pursuant to which tribes that receive tribal priority allocation funding for this fiscal year must waive a claim of immunity, be subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts, and grant original jurisdiction of all civil actions involving the tribe to U.S. district courts. This provision will also be the subject of extensive and sometimes complex debate during the consideration of the bill. At its core, section 120 is an attempt to preserve the right of all Americans to have their grievances heard and decided in neutral courts. 
The Interior bill continues the Federal investment in key energy research and development programs. Fossil energy research and development is funded at $363.9 million, comparable to the fiscal year 1997 enacted level. Increases above the budget request are provided to sustain critical technology development programs intended to produce environmental benefits while improving energy efficiency. 
Mr. President, $627.4 million is provided for energy conservation programs, an increase of $58 million over the fiscal year 1997 level. Increases over current year levels include $17 million for transportation programs, $20 million for building research and development, and $16 million for industry programs. The bill provides $129 million for the weatherization program and $31.1 million for the State grant program, respective increases of $8 million and $2.1 million over current year levels. 
The bill does include a sale of $207.5 million worth of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to finance operation of that reserve. 
Though I had hoped not to sell oil to finance reserve operations in fiscal year 1998, the constraints of the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation, the precedent set in the President's budget request, and the funding expectations raised by House action made it impossible to avoid the sale. While I remain open to alternatives to oil sales, it is with the recognition that any such alternative will likely have an adverse impact on other programs funded in this bill. 
Within the grouping of programs that I have identified as cultural lies the one agency that probably receives more attention per appropriated dollar than any other funded in this bill--the National Endowments for the Arts. The bill reported by the committee provides just over $100 million for the NEA, roughly the same as the fiscal year 1997 level. The fact that the committee has chosen to fund the NEA, which the House did not do, reflects the overwhelming support that the agency enjoys among committee members, both Republican and Democrat. Nevertheless, I anticipate a spirited debate about the future of the agency as we proceed with consideration of this bill, and when we go to conference with the House. 
Mr. President, putting this legislation together has been a tremendous challenge. While the fiscal constraints under which the subcommittee must operate make it impossible to please everyone, I do believe this bill represents a fair balance between the priorities of the Members of this body--both Republican and Democrat--and the priorities of the administration. I truly hope to have the support of my colleagues in voting for final passage, as well as their consideration on any amendments that may be offered during debate on the bill. 
Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the staff for their hard work on this bill. Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Martin Delgado, and Kevin Johnson of the subcommittee staff have worked many long hours to put this bill together, and I have greatly appreciated their advice, counsel, and perseverance. Hank Kashdan--our detailee from the Forest Service--has also been a great help, and we will be sorry to see him go at the end of the year. I also want to thank Chuck Berwick and Nina Nguyen of my personal staff for all their help on a number of critical issues in this bill. On Senator Byrd's staff, it has been a continued pleasure to work with Sue Masica, without whose expertise and institutional knowledge this bill would have been a lesser product. I also want to thank Carole Geagley of Senator Byrd's staff, as well as Lisa Mendelson who worked with Senator Byrd's staff as a detailee from the Park Service. I would be remiss in not extending my thanks to the full committee staff for their help, cooperation, and guidance, particularly the majority and minority staff directors, Steve Cortese and Jim English. 
With that, I will defer to Senator Byrd. Before doing that, I want to say publicly once again how much I have learned, working as subcommittee chairman, from his vast experience, his guidance and, perhaps even more significant, in the last few years his personal friendship. His technical knowledge of the appropriations process, his appreciation for its nuances, and his respect for the entire Senate have been invaluable to me both in producing the bill and, I hope, in becoming a better Senator. At the same time, his advocacy on behalf of his colleagues has been invaluable to many on that side of the aisle and, I think I can say, to this side of the aisle as well. It has been a wonderful partnership. I hope we can continue it for a long time to come.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I do want to respond to the thoughtful suggestions of the Senators from North Dakota and South Dakota while each of them is still on the floor. 
I reflected, as they discussed the value of higher education, in this case to Indians, on the force of their argument. It certainly is possible that on some other elements of this bill relating to Indians that we may have some disagreements. But, certainly, if we speak about either a doctrine of self-determination or self-sufficiency, education makes a major contribution to the ability of an individual either to be self-determining or self-sufficient. To the extent that we can encourage education, greater sophistication and greater knowledge, obviously we ought to do so. 
In this bill we have added $1 million to approximately a $27 million appropriation last year for the particular purpose to which they speak. That is $2 million less than the President's request, where the total allocation we have is some $46 million less than the President's request. We have, however, given almost a $700,000 increase to the United Tribes Technical College in the State of the Senator from North Dakota, which the President did not include in his budget, based essentially on the same philosophy that has been stated here by the two of them. 
I can assure both Senators that we will see whether or not in some respect or another we can accommodate what seems to be a reasonable request, understanding that we have a lot of reasonable requests in a lot of areas of the bill. Also, I have to state that one reservation I have is to the sort of let's just cut everything else proportionately without setting values. We worked as hard as we could on these matters, the others of which applied to all citizens of the United States. The degree of deferred maintenance in our national parks and national forests and other recreational facilities is literally measured in the billions of dollars. We tried to at least begin to work on that. 
So, if, perhaps, the focus of where we find the $2 million could be more narrowly aimed, if they could discuss with their own constituents whether there are other Indian programs that could absorb such a shift, or some other thing of that sort, it will make it easier for us. 
But I do want to assure both of them that I have heard what they have to say. With their philosophy about education, I entirely agree. And to the extent, in a bill where, as I said in my opening remarks, we had 1,800 requests from Members of the Senate, very few of which this Senator thinks in the abstract were not justified, by any means, I will try to the best of my ability to oblige. I am sure I speak for Senator Byrd when I make that statement.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I spoke to this amendment at length on two occasions and intend to do so again tonight, but as a matter of deference to my many friends on this side who want to speak on the amendment and to many of those on the other side who wish to do so and to go on to other business, I will reserve my principal argument until the end. 
Suffice it to say this is an amendment designed to see to it that the individual school districts in the United States be permitted to spend the great bulk of the money that we appropriate, in this case somewhat over $11 million, as they see fit rather than with respect to hundreds and thousands of pages of detailed regulations that are the bane of almost every school district in the country. 
The fundamental philosophical question is just this: Do we believe that individual school districts and parents and teachers know best how to handle education in their own communities, or do we believe those fundamental decisions are best left to bureaucrats here in Washington, DC? I believe the former. The opponents to this amendment believe the latter. 
With that, I yield the floor to allow other Members who wish to speak to the amendment.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-gorton-wa-11-19970910</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. I cannot answer that question categorically. I can say that we have something over $11 billion in this appropriations bill, which would be distributed pursuant to this amendment. Because at the present time the administrative costs --the sand in the wheels--amounts to about 15 percent of all of the money that we as taxpayers send to Washington, DC, that goes to the Department of Education, before it gets back, the total distribution to the school districts of the United States will be more than a billion and a half dollars more than it is at the present time, which means--just in simple mathematics--that a great bulk of school districts will end up getting more money. Moreover, that 15 percent doesn't include the amount that the State superintendents of public schools take out of most of these categorical aid programs for their part of the administration at the present time, further enhancing the amount of money that will get to each individual school district. 
Even having said that, I say to my friend from Kentucky, I believe the most important single element in this bill, from the point of view of having money spent on children's education, is the removal of the huge numbers of requirements to meet the qualifications for hundreds of different categorical aid programs, which now come out of even the money that gets to the school districts, who must hire all kinds of administrators to see to it that the money is spent in this federally determined, uniform category. One school district superintendent, reported to me by one of my friends, has said something that is consistent with what I hear from my own State: `We get about 10 percent of all of the money we spend on schools from the Federal Government, but 60 percent of all of the forms we have to fill out, 60 percent of all the time we have to use, is spent accounting for that 10 percent.' 
So it is hard for me to imagine a school district anywhere in the country that is going to have less money to spend on the education of its children under this amendment than it does at the present time, and the overwhelming majority of them will have far more.

Mr. GORTON. Yes. I am quite certain that Kentucky would--with the exception of the modification that we made with respect to title I, where the proportions will be identical next year to what they are in the present year. We have a slight poverty-based preference in this bill. We divide the 50 States --or the 48 States other than Alaska and Hawaii--into five categories, and the 10 richest States have their allocation multiplied by .9, the 10 poorest States by 1.1, and the States in between by 1.05, 1.0, or .95, respectively, so that the student in the poor State gets a greater degree of aid than the student in a rich State.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the statement by my friend and colleague from New York on educational policy is greatly to be commended. He set out a vision that I think is a magnificent one for parents and students and teachers and all interested in education all across the United States. 
As he pointed out, this amendment is not directed at all of those goals by any stretch of the imagination but is focused on the goal of trusting to a far greater extent than we have in the past the wisdom of the parents and the teachers and the administrators and local school board members in each of the thousands of school districts in the United States with respect to what best can advance the education of the students for which they are responsible. 
The principal goal of my amendment is to remove these thousands of pages of regulations and detailed supervision, frequently on a one-size-fits-all basis, directed from on high here in Washington, DC, at urban, rural and suburban school districts all across the United States. 
Already, this amendment has been improved by suggestions by the Senator from New York and others with respect to title I. And he has now asked the question that was asked by the Senator from Kentucky in a slightly different form--each Senator, while he or she has strong general ideas, also represents particular constituencies in the particular State--as to whether or not it is possible to see to it that as we move into this situation we do not have States that are huge losers as well as winners. 
It is my opinion--it is the reason that I introduced this amendment--that every school district in every State in the United States should be a winner in two ways. First, because so much less money has to be spent on administration that more dollars would actually get down to individual students; but, second, because these mountains of regulations and impositions from the Federal Government on local school districts will be removed, the use of the same number of dollars would be far more effective in the ultimate educational result. 
But, since that is much more important than the formula, the Senator from New York has said, `Can't we hold harmless each of the States, at least?' I think we can only do it by States, because now so much of this money doesn't go to school districts, it goes to the States. The States distribute it. And, on reflection, I think he is right. I think he is correct in that. 
So, I will ask the indulgence of my colleagues to send one more modification to the desk. Before I send it to the desk I think I just simply ought to read it for their approval. It would be that: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the total amount awarded to local education agencies in each State under this section shall not be less than the net dollars that State would have received absent the provisions of this section. 
What does that mean? That means that roughly 85 percent of the money, the money that now gets out of Washington, DC, would be distributed just as it is at the present time. The other 15 percent, or the great bulk of that 15 percent that is no longer needed for all of the bureaucrats writing and enforcing these regulations here, would go in the way in which the rest of the amendment describes. 
I think probably that makes even more forceful the point that I have made from the very beginning of this debate, that its primary goal is to see to it that we allow the decisions about the way the money is spent to be made by the people who are actually spending it and actually providing the education. My own opinion is that's far more important, even, than the billion-plus dollars that would be distributed to the various States because of the smaller expenses of administration. I think this meets with the suggestion the Senator from New York made, and I would like to ask for his comments on it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I see no overriding reason to extend this debate. I want to thank the large number of my colleagues who have come to the floor, many of them greatly to their inconvenience, during the course of this evening to speak in favor of my ideas, and the significant number who, at one time or another during the course of the last 3 days, have spoken on it at other times. 
I am prepared now to summarize the reasons for favoring the amendment, to defer to Senator Jeffords from Vermont, who will oppose the amendment, and perhaps take the opportunity to close very briefly and to announce, as I understand it, there is no further business to come before the Senate this evening except for a little wrapup which I will undertake. 
The Senator from Oklahoma spoke about a study that I believe was prepared by a very thoughtful Member of the House on the total number of Federal education programs, and the number approaches almost 800. He also spoke of almost $100 billion that were spent on these programs. That is a longer list and a larger amount of money than is involved in this amendment because, of course, it includes higher education, it includes preschool education, like Head Start, and it includes a number of education and training programs managed by departments other than the Department of Education. 
I think that many of those programs could be and should be equally integrated into the formula that I have posed here, but I simply lacked the ability to analyze each of those 760 or 788 programs. So what we have done is to take the principal kindergarten through 12th grade programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, with the exception of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, which we debated very thoroughly in the Senate a few months ago, impact aid and a few other programs which don't fit well into this formula, and to say that instead of continuing dozens of narrow, categorical aid programs to education, each managed by its own bureaucracy not just here in Washington, DC, but in State capitals and in school district offices all across the country, each with its own requirements, each presenting to school districts the risk that they may inadvertently spend some of the money on an educational purpose other than that outlined in the statute, and consolidating all of them into one appropriation which will total something over $11 billion and stating that once each State has received the net amount of money that it would get under present law, that all of the money will be distributed not to State education agencies, but to local school districts on the basis of the number of students each of those school districts serve, with some slight preferences for school districts in poorer States and with the changes I have already described in title I. 
One of the goals of this amendment, Mr. President, is to see to it that our school districts get more money, and get more money they will, because close to 15 percent of all of the money that we appropriate at the present time stays in administration in Washington, DC, or close to Washington, DC. More of it sticks in our State capitals with the administrators of school programs in each of those States, not so much because the State capitals want to stick it there, but because they have to meet the multitudinous requirements in Federal statutes and regulations. And much more of it must be spent by school districts, not on education, but on complying with these hundreds of pages of statutory and administrative requirements. 
So if this amendment is adopted, school districts will have more money to spend on educating children in an aggregate amount of well over $1 billion, and I suspect probably $2 or $3 billion out of the $11 billion. But I think more important than even the extra money is the freedom that we will give to the people who are actually providing our children with their education: their teachers, with the contributions that come from active and concerned parents, the principals and other administrators of our schools, the elected school board members who almost, without exception, serve without pay. They will be empowered by this legislation to determine in each case how best to meet their educational goals, how best to meet standards imposed by the States or, in some cases, by the Federal Government, general standards of how well people should be educated, not detailed standards of how money should be spent. 
So, in summary, seeing my friend and colleague from Vermont here, I simply want to present the issue in these terms: Do we believe that fundamental educational policies and procedures are best determined by those who are closest to the students--their parents and teachers and administrators--or do we believe that those policies are best determined on the floor of this U.S. Senate or by the bureaucrats of the U.S. Department of Education? To the extent that we hold the latter belief, of course, this amendment is unacceptable. I don't think that that belief is warranted. I don't think it is shared by other than a relatively small minority of the American people. In a free country, in a free society, we trust the people, and that's exactly what this amendment proposes to do.  
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe my friend and colleague from Vermont has stated the arguments on his side forcefully and eloquently and has illustrated, as I hope I have, the fundamental philosophical differences over this amendment, over any amendment that is even remotely similar to this. 
The Senator from Vermont believes that a large number of educational priorities ought to be set here in the Congress of the United States by the Secretary of Education and the people who work in his department. Certainly there is an appropriate theory in this country that that is true, that the U.S. Department of Education ought to be able to impose significant controls over State departments of education and even more detailed controls over every school district in the United States, and that in the absence of such requirements not only will money be wasted but the quality of the educational product will be depreciated, will be less. 
I don't know that there is much out there in the educational field that indicates any huge degree of success on the part of this top-down set of educational priorities. But nonetheless, it is possible to make such an argument. 
My argument, and this is where the Senator from Vermont and I disagree, is that I believe informed parents, informed teachers who are in the classroom every single day of their professional lives, informed and dedicated administrators and school board members, most of whom are elected to nonpaying jobs, not only have an interest in the quality of education that they supply to their children, their students, the young people in their community, but that they are better able to determine how the money they have from whatever source is spent toward those ends than can we here, or anyone in a Washington, DC bureaucracy. 
As a consequence, this amendment says get rid of the regulations that apply to the programs that are covered by it, distribute the money directly to the school districts that are providing education and let them spend it as they will. 
At one level, of course, that does bypass State education entities in order that they not spend any of the money or hold any of it back, but it does not prevent any State education entity from saying you have to instruct the mathematics, history, whatever they wish to do, to set a curriculum, much of which is set by the States. 
It just says with Federal money, the Federal Government is not going to tell you how to spend it. It is as simple as that. 
We are not talking about local governments. The phrase in this amendment is `local education agencies.' By and large, though not entirely, single-purpose school districts. 
To say what this really means is that people in these local communities will immediately take the new money and not spend it on education but do something else with it or provide property tax relief, in my view, evidences a great lack of trust in the fact that our citizens care about the education of their children. 
I think we know from all of the surveys in which we engage, from all the speeches we make, from all the people we listen to, that our citizens care very deeply about the education of their children, and to say if we do not force them to spend money in particular ways here in Washington, DC, they will not spend it at all, that they will ignore our kids, is without any evidence, in fact, in the real world. 
Much of this money is getting through to these school districts right now. I differ with the Senator from Vermont on how much we are talking about. We have not, by any of the changes of this amendment, taken out impact aid, disability education, or 50 percent of local education. They were never in the first version. 
With respect to title I, we have not taken it out. We just have a somewhat different distribution formula. The same number of dollars is involved now as when I first discussed it earlier. The point, roughly 85 percent of this money is somehow or another getting at least down to the State level at the present time. Added money that school districts will get will be the money we save in administration here and in State capitals. I am convinced it will all go into the education of our children. But the number of dollars, the additional dollars, even if they can be measured, will not be nearly as important as the removal of Federal regulatory detail. 
The Senator from Idaho described the situation in one of his districts, which I believe is pretty close to universal: 10 percent of the money comes from the Federal Government and 60 percent of the rules. That is a terrible imbalance. We would like to get rid of almost all of those 60 percent of the rules and power our school districts, power our teachers, and power our parents and see whether or not they cannot do a somewhat better job than the rather poor job we have done so far ourselves. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from North Dakota that I have listened with great care to his remarks and with a strong degree of sympathy and support for all that he has to say. I do want to add two cautions or questions that I know he will consider very thoughtfully in this connection, however. 
I am here on the floor to speak to an amendment I introduced last night that would take dozens, perhaps hundreds, of categoric programs for education and consolidate them and distribute them on a formula basis to each school district, with a firm belief that our school board members and teachers in various schools throughout the country can make a better 
determination as to how to use that money than can bureaucrats here in Washington, DC. 
But a part of my talk in a few moments will relate to this very question of achievement. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota, but the two caveats I have are these. Will we have a set of national standards or national tests that truly measure learning, knowledge, as we wish it to be? 
There is great suspicion that anything sponsored by the Federal Department of Education will be of questionable validity in the real world in showing where our students are. And will a set of national tests drive out more sophisticated and better quality State and/or local tests? Will school districts and State superintendents of public instruction across the country say, fine, we have these national tests now, we don't need to do anything other than to teach to those tests--the very modest one subject in fourth grade and one subject in eighth grade? 
I say that because, in preparing for my other comments, I have here the results of the first experimental year of a new set of tests given in the State of Washington to a wide number of students in more than 250 school districts and some private schools throughout the State. Now, these tests are far more sophisticated and far deeper than anything we are talking about here on a national level. Starting in the fourth grade but to be extended up to the tenth grade in the future, students were tested in listening, reading, writing, and mathematics. In other words, four sets of tests, rather than the one called for in the President's proposal. 
Moreover, they were tested for their actual mastery of the subjects, rather than just on some sliding scale: Are you in the fiftieth percentile of all the people who took the test, either in the State or across the country? The State of Washington does use the current national tests in some of these areas, which are simply true, false, or a fill-in-the-blank-with-a-pencil kind of test. These new tests, however, in a number of the areas, include essay examinations as well as true, false, or multiple choice tests. 
This is what some of the national organizations or experts have to say about this. I am quoting from last Thursday's Seattle Times. 
Washington's new test gets high marks from experts familiar with similar assessments in other States. Most say it will take time for students to meet the new standard and that these kinds of tests, called performance-based assessments, are more demanding than the fill-in-the-bubbles tests most parents and students are used to. 
The problem with standardized tests is that they hold schools accountable not for how students do in relation to a fixed standard, but rather in relation to how other students do --`a fuzzy concept,' said Dr. Philip Daro of the New Standards Project, a consortium of States and urban districts creating education-reform models. 
`Performance-based tests are more realistic, more practical, more like people evaluated in the workplace,' Daro said. 
The American Federation of Teachers said Washington's standards in English and science meet its criteria for being strong, coherent and useful to teachers and parents. The State's math standards are borderline and its social-studies standards are considered below par, with too little attention given to that history. 
Under those consensuses, one of the reasons for the criticism of mathematics is that even in the Washington State tests, among students who rank very high in National College Board examinations and the like, you can get a perfect score in the fourth grade mathematics test even though you have the wrong answer. Some of the SAT questions give a perfect score in this test if you get the reasoning right even if you come up with the wrong answer. That is not going to please the real world, or a potential employer is not going to be comforted by having an employee who may think logically but reaches the wrong answer in a mathematical computation. 
Given that, however, Mr. President, it is breathtaking and disappointing to report that in these four areas 62 percent of the fourth graders who took the test in my State exceeded the standard for listening, 48 percent for reading, 32 percent for writing, and 22 percent for mathematics even with the possibility of getting a perfect score on some of the tests on some of the questions in the test without getting the right answer. Twenty-six percent of our fourth grade students flunked all four, or failed to meet the standard in all four, and only 14 percent met the standards in all four. 
I was very disturbed by the fact that our State superintendent of public instruction, who is new, and, may I say, said, `We must not be discouraged by results of the assessment, or try to hammer children and teachers.' I think we should be discouraged by those results. I don't think we should hammer children and teachers. And I will speak in a few minutes on the proposition that I think they ought to get more direct aid from ourselves, and fewer bureaucrats telling them what to do and how to do it. But these are very disappointing results. 
I guess my fear and my only reservation is about the remark on national standards, with which in theory I certainly agree, in connection with the talk by the Senator from North Dakota is that I would hate to see a set of national standards that we work down to rather than up from. 
The same article said that only one State, Iowa, is not engaged in some kind of testing at the present time. 
So my real question on this is how do we see to it that a set of so-called `national standards' don't end up depreciating, or making less demanding, the requirement to meet certain standards that many States have now and others like my own are moving toward with great rapidity? 
I simply have that as a question.

<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. My answer to that question is an unqualified yes. Of course we should do just that. What we must take great care with is seeing to it that any national standards strengthen and encourage the standards that are already being set in any of the States; that they be able to move forward; not an excuse to move backward; and that they measure real knowledge. I believe that the heart of some of the objections to the national standards are the ones made by the American Federation of Teachers to Washington State mathematics. There just is no way except in the heart of some totally abstract profession that you can justify giving 100 percent to a student who gets the wrong answer to a question. It may be encouraging students to move towards a way to come up with the right answer. But that is not something that ought to get 100 percent. 
I hope we derive a system for whatever national tests come, and I think some are likely to come that measure real knowledge and real progress, and that encourages States to make their own standards even tougher and their assessments to take place more frequently.

Mr. GORTON. I would just like to say in summary that I am in no way critical of what my State has done, and the movement towards these standards I find very encouraging. I think absent these constructive criticisms that they are likely to set very, very good and very significant standards. It is just that I have to predicate the comment that we shouldn't be discouraged by the results. We should be discouraged by the results. And we should resolve that we are going to do everything possible to cause those results to improve markedly and as quickly as possible.

<DOCNO>105-gorton-wa-8-19970909</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few short weeks ago, Congress and the President of the United States agreed to provide $48 billion over the course of the next 10 years as an incentive to States to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To receive this incentive, States must expand eligibility levels to children living in families whose incomes are up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. 
Mr. President, this provided a real anomaly, a true injustice, with respect to the State of Washington, and to varying extents to the States of Hawaii, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont as well. In the case of each of these States, though I must speak most specifically to my own, State legislatures had already expanded the eligibility for Medicare to children in families with incomes up to roughly 200 percent of the poverty level. 
Most of the other States, the States that were designed to be incentivized, have mandatory levels of 100 to 133 percent of the poverty level in incomes and, therefore, in many cases would get these incentives for a very 
significant expansion of Medicare eligible children for these Kidcare programs. 
The net result, however, was that for States like the State of Washington, the fact that they had been more generous, more progressive, more liberal, whatever one wishes to call it on their own, resulted in a dramatic penalty. Our taxpayers, of course, will contribute to this expansion. We will, of course, be providing Kidcare to exactly the same group of children that all other States will be providing under the Kidcare amendment, but we will not be eligible for the incentive. 
Mr. President, if that were allowed to stand, it would be a dramatic lesson to every 1 of the 50 States of the United States in dealing with every program for which there is Federal assistance--every program--the expansion of which is debated here, to make absolutely certain that they did not expand those programs themselves, because if they just waited, they would get more money from the Federal Government to do so; and if they went ahead on their own, they would be penalized. 
That is exactly what has happened to us here. Our argument for more equitable treatment met with the approval of Members of the Senate when we were debating this issue, and our States were at least in part compensated for the work that they had already done. With the exception I think of a single State in the group of five that I have named, that benefit disappeared in the ultimate conference committee report. 
Justice would require, it seems to me, Mr. President, that each of these States be made whole, receive the same Federal subsidy for all of its children who live in families between the previous Federal requirement at 100 to 133 percent and the 200 percent. Because of opposition, however, we do not ask that in this amendment. 
All this amendment does is to say that the allocation that is made to all States, on the basis of the number of eligible children, be available for the State of Washington and for these other States to use to the extent that we have children living in families at less than 200 percent of the poverty level who are of course eligible under our law but did not avail themselves of the opportunity to become insured. 
In other words, like the other States, we will get the incentive only for children who are not eligible now and who take advantage of the availability of such insurance in the future. Because allocations are made by the Federal Government on the basis of eligibility and not this precise use, and you just drawdown on the use, this amendment will not affect--I want to make this absolutely clear to every Member of the Senate--will not affect the allocations and the ability to use this program by any other State in the United States. 
We are not raiding anyone else's money. The eligibility is created by what amounts to at least the State entitlement will only be using the allocation that we already get in theory but cannot use in practice. No one else will lose anything as a result.

Mr. GORTON. I will read the end of that memorandum: `The amendment would not change or otherwise affect the allocation of Title XXI funds to states but changes the way in which state funds may be used.' 
Will not change the allocation. It will change the way in which they can be used in my State and I believe to a greater or lesser extent, three other States. 
I simply want to repeat for the purposes of this argument, these are States that did what the policy behind Kidcare in effect requires of other States before it was required by this Congress and by the Federal Government. These are States that went out of their way to try to see to it that health insurance was available to these relatively low-income families for their children. It is unconscionable, I believe, Mr. President, that we should say because you did the job we came to somewhat later, earlier, you are just out of luck. You can continue to pay for it yourself. You will not get the incentive that Kidcare provided, so on behalf of my own State and on behalf of a few others, without penalizing any other State in the Union, I am asking for the reasonable treatment, the fair treatment, that this amendment provides. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent it be charged equally to both sides.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to express my disappointment in the position taken by my friend from West Virginia, although across party lines we have become so close personally to one another in a longtime, longstanding debate of great importance, that it always seems to me emotionally at least that we are likely to agree on other issues as well. I am greatly disappointed that we don't on this one. 
He tells me that he had hoped to go and visit with the Governor of West Virginia on this subject today. Yet, the position he takes here is that while West Virginia should be--and I agree with him should be--entitled to an incentive for all of the new children who become eligible for Kidcare because their families' incomes are not more than 200 percent of the poverty line, that not only should the State of Washington be deprived of that incentive for children in exactly the same position who receive Kidcare through the State at the present time but that we shouldn't even be able to get the incentive for those who do not yet receive it who are in precisely the position of the children in West Virginia for 
whose circumstances he so eloquently speaks. I find it is hard to see that anyone could justify a situation such as that. But that is the situation in the bill as it was passed, not the situation as it was written here in the Senate. 
We had the Senate version--Senator Murray and I. With this amendment it would have been unnecessary. The Senator expresses apprehension that if this amendment passes there will be many more States with requests. 
But I simply say to the Senator that we already have an agreement on the amendments that are going to be considered on this bill. Someone may do it someday in the future in some other set of circumstances but not on the bill that deals with Medicaid and Medicare for the whole next year. 
In any event, the idea that you can't do something that is right because it might create a precedent in the future to do something that is wrong is not a form of argument that seems to me to be especially persuasive. Since it is impossible for that to happen in connection with this bill, it perhaps has even less weight. 
Obviously, there are differences with respect to this amendment. I regret that I have fought, and we worked diligently to see whether or not we couldn't come up with something that simply could be agreed to, as many other amendments on this bill have--we have not obviously been able to do that. I greatly regret it. But I greatly regret the position on the part of other Senators that, we have ours, it is tough on you, you don't need it. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senator from Vermont, the modification strikes all references to any departments other than those going through the Department of Education, and there is a modification with respect to the distribution formula for the States of Alaska and Hawaii, States that have artificially high income levels which do not necessarily reflect the standard of living in those two very expensive States, and adds one additional minor exception to the scope of the bill. 
Fundamentally, Mr. President, this amendment is based on the philosophy that the school board members, the administrators, the teachers and the parents in communities all across the United States are better able to set their educational priorities and to meet their educational goals than is the Congress of the United States or bureaucrats of the Department of Education. You can't make a telephone call because we tried to call the Congressional Research Service and ask how many programs there are that support the education of our children between kindergarten and 12th grade. 
Instead, they can identify a few programs, large programs, which are devoted exclusively to that purpose, but there are hundreds of others which do so in part that they cannot identify. 
Congressman Hoekstra of Michigan, in the House, has identified approximately 760 programs funded by the Federal Government directly or indirectly affecting the education of our children between kindergarten and the 12th grade. No one can say how much of this money actually gets into teaching children as against paying for bureaucrats at the Federal level, the State level, the school district level, or the time it takes the teachers to fill out all of the forms necessary to meet the auditor's requirements of each of these individual programs. 
The Cato Institute has determined that of the roughly $15 billion going from the Department of Education for K through 12 programs only about $13 billion gets to local education, but it does not and cannot reflect how much the local education agencies have to spend on the administrative requirements of these 760 education programs. 
So what this bill says is that with certain exceptions, the largest and most notable of which are the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that was debated earlier this year, and impact aid, which goes to school districts with a large Federal presence, for 1 year at least we are going to ignore all of these hundreds of programs and their specific requirements and all of the bureaucracy in the Department of Education and simply take the exact number of dollars that are included for those programs in this bill and to distribute them on a per student basis to every school district in the United States. To the best of our ability to do so--and I must confess that in dealing with this number of programs, we may have missed some--we are speaking of a little bit more than $11 billion of the appropriations in this bill. 
We are going to say, instead of our deciding how they ought to be spent, instead of our saying that every school district in the country has to meet exactly the same requirements for getting this money, let us accept the novel idea to which almost all of us give lip service when we are at home that maybe the men and women who are dedicated enough to run for positions on local school boards, maybe the teachers who are in the classroom every day, perhaps the principals and administrators there can use that $11 billion plus to provide more in the way of educational services than are being provided at the present time. Almost without exception our debates in this Chamber on education policy, when we deal with budget resolutions, when we deal with reconciliation bills, when we deal with this appropriations bill, have to do with how much money we are going to spend on education. It is the firm view of Members of this body and most of the general public that the more money we spend the better the results will be. And yet we are all convinced that the results are not very good. We are disturbed enough about it so that we want to create national standards and national tests. 
I just had a discussion on that subject with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. At the same time I shared with the body the pioneering work my own State of Washington is doing in setting standards and testing students against those standards and the highly disappointing results of the first of those sets of tests this year, that only 22 percent of our fourth grade students meet those standards in mathematics. I am convinced that we ought to talk about quality as well as quantity; that simply adding dollars to programs, the net result of which are test results like these and like the others we deprecate all across the country, is not the wisest course of action. 
Last year, the Congress in its wisdom did something that Congresses rarely do. We decided that we did not know an awful lot about welfare and that maybe 30 years of an increasing nationalization of welfare policy, the net result of which was worsening almost every social pathology welfare was designed to cure, was not the right course of action. And so in essence we said perhaps we should not set all the requirements ourselves. Perhaps we should let 50 States experiment broadly with welfare policy and maybe all of us will learn more about what works and what does not work. 
This amendment gives the Senate the opportunity to do just exactly that with our education policies in kindergarten through 12th grade. Curiously enough, we seem to have largely accepted that policy with respect to higher education. The great bulk of our higher education programs go directly to students--guaranteed student loans, Pell grants, other means tested aid to students go to the customer, the user of educational services rather than to some huge bureaucracy that is given the power to say what colleges and universities can teach and how they teach it. 
Now, we know that there are higher educational institutions that do not do a very good job, but our cure has not been to cut off students and stop allowing them to make choices. We do allow them to make those choices. Why don't we try in this particular case--this is not a debate on vouchers and 
giving money directly to parents, as much as I may favor that. This is a debate about giving the money directly to school districts, to the professionals who work in the classrooms, to the amateurs in almost all cases who run for and are elected to school boards all across the United States. It is difficult for me to imagine, with three Senators in the Chamber, that the priorities of the school districts in Rutland, VT, and Portland, OR, and Bellevue, WA, are going to be identical. It is impossible for me to justify the amount of paperwork that must go into justifying the expenditure of the money for these hundreds and hundreds of programs that go to K through 12 education at the present time, right from the level of the classroom on up through the individual school, to school district, to the State education agency, to the U.S. Department of Education. 
Let's take a page out of what we hope will be a successful decentralization of our welfare policy and decentralize decisionmaking in our schools. Let our parents through their PTA's, our teachers, our school board members, our principals, decide how to use this $11 billion to educate kids. And then if we can devise it, we can in fact come up with some tests, some standards that they ought to meet and test them against those standards. What we know now is that the money is not being spent very well, at least it is not being spent very successfully. Let's try temporarily to let someone else make those decisions and see whether we cannot do better. 
I am convinced that we will do a great deal better.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on this subject, it is obvious that between my friend, the Senator from Vermont, and myself there is a great gulf to fix. I note just a couple of his phrases. One was `carte blanche.' The other was the necessity for `guidance from above.' 
It is the view of the Senator from Vermont that without `guidance from above,' our teachers, our school board members, our principals won't know what to do, that they will be clueless about the education of our children for our 21st century world, and that unless they are told by us, right here in this body, U.S. Senators, what their priorities are, how they are going to meet those priorities, and unless we let a group of bureaucrats in the Department of Education, right to the tiniest detail, dictate how Federal money is going to be spent, our teachers, school board members, principals and parents won't have the slightest idea of how to meet these challenges, and they will waste all of this money, it will go for nothing. 
Well, my golly, if we had been able to show by tests that we have been overwhelmingly successful, that everyone was doing well, I don't suppose I would be out here now. But one of the other features we are almost certain to authorize, with my conditional approval at least, is to come up with a rational way in which to test our students at various levels with respect to their knowledge about the most important of the academic subjects they are in school to learn. 
My reservations on that is, I have grave fear that national testing may actually drive out more rigid State testing in a number of places across the country. If it encourages even stronger standards, then it seems to me that it is a very, very good idea. It is one thing to test, but it is another thing to tell every teacher, `Here's who you have to teach and here is how you have to teach and, by the way, here are all the forms you have to fill out at some point or another during your school day to make absolutely certain you didn't teach the wrong student and, therefore, disqualify our school district for some of its title I money.' 
Obviously, every Member of this body who believes that he or she knows more about educational priorities than do his school board members, his teachers, his or her parents should certainly vote against an amendment like this. If Members are content, Mr. President, with between 700 and 760 different education programs coming out of probably five or six different Departments of the U.S. Government, each with its own requirement and its own forms to fill out, if they believe that is a satisfactory way to do things, fine, they should vote for the status quo. 
I have more trust in the American people. I have more trust in the people who give up their time without compensation to serve on school boards and in parent-teachers associations. I have more trust in the teachers that we have in the schools themselves. I think they will do a better job with the money. I think we will get better education. Of course, anyone can have a quarrel with the formula for distribution, which is a rough formula giving slightly more money to poor States or school districts in poor States than it does to school districts in wealthy States. But I believe I can make this representation, Mr. President. It will be difficult to find a school district anywhere in the United States that doesn't have more money for the actual education of its students under this formula than it does at the present time. Why? Because at the present time, a whole bunch of this money, hundreds of millions of dollars, gets taken out right here in Washington, DC, by the bureaucracy. More hundreds of millions of dollars get taken out by the State educational entities, and tremendous burdens, nonteaching burdens, are imposed on local schools, school districts and teachers in keeping track of all of it and filling out the forms. So the most disfavored school districts under this formula will actually get more money to put into the education of their students than they do at the present time. 
I will be the first to admit, Mr. President, that on the floor of the Senate, this is a brand new and a radical proposal. I would be surprised if it became law as a part of this appropriations bill. But, Mr. President, we are 10 years past due in discussing this subject. It is time we did here what we say we want to do when we are at home. I can't speak for every other Senator, but I know that one of the most popular statements I can make at a town meeting or to any group in the State of Washington is, `I believe you, through your schools right here, should have more say as to how you spend the money that goes into educating your children.' Principals approve of it, school board members approve of it, teachers approve of it, parents approve of it, the taxpaying public approves of it. 
I would be willing to make a small wager that, in general terms, almost every Member of this body makes the same speech under appropriate circumstances in his or her own State when he or she is asked about that question. `Yes, I believe in local control of schools. Yes, I believe in locally elected school boards. Yes, I believe decisions can be made better close to the student, but * * *' Usually they don't articulate the `but.' `But' comes back here when they actually vote in a manner totally contrary to the way in which they speak at home. 
So this provides a simple opportunity, Mr. President, an opportunity to say whether you really do believe that educational policy, that money for education is likely to be spent more wisely and more effectively by those who are in the field doing it professionally, meeting with their students every day, or whether, in the phrase of the Senator from Vermont, they need `guidance from above,' guidance from right here in these seats, because otherwise, a carte blanche will result in educational disaster. 
I hope Members will give serious consideration to this philosophy. This may be the first time we have discussed this in the form of an amendment like this in a number of years, but I do not think, Mr. President, it is going to be the last time. I believe we will discuss the general philosophy of this proposal, at least, increasingly until the time that we are willing in fact to place a degree of trust in local educational authorities that we all say we have in theory. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is a truly incredible statement on the part of the Senator from Vermont. In the first place, of course, this amendment does not give this money to local governments. It gives it to local education authorities, that is, school boards and school districts. Evidently the Senator from Vermont feels that his own constituents have so little regard for education in the State of Vermont that they would immediately cut their contribution to the education of their children by the amount of the distribution to those local school boards. I would be ashamed to make that comment about the people of the State of Washington. I cannot imagine that that would happen. 
Moreover, Mr. President, the Senator seems to forget that at least a significant part of this money is in the educational system at the present time. It is my view that just not enough of it gets there, that too much of it gets siphoned by the bureaucrats on the way to a school district in Vermont or in Oregon or in the State of Washington. But to make the statement that only we are wise and only 100 Members of the U.S. Senate are really concerned about education and that, if we were to allow a local school agency to set its own priorities with the money we appropriated to education, that they might not do it, that they would just simply decide, `Oh, no, education isn't very important. We can now cut down our own contribution level,' is insulting, I would say, Mr. President, to every citizen of the United States who cares about his or her children or his or her country or their future. 
This money is going into education now. That is why we are appropriating it. Too much of it is going to a bureaucracy and not getting to the children who are being educated. Too many priorities are being set here, and too few at home. That is what the question is about. 
Mark my words, Mr. President, successful or unsuccessful, if this amendment passes, more money--not less--more money will get into the education of almost every student in the United States of America. The fundamental question is not how much; the fundamental question is, who ought to make the decision as to how it is spent? We here in this body, great educational experts as we seem to think we are, or the people who are actually providing the teaching in the day-to-day operations of our schools? 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to thank profusely my friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his remarks and for introducing this amendment on my behalf. I was able to get here just in time to second his remarks. 
I believe this amendment is going to give us an opportunity to debate an issue of great importance to the people of the United States with respect to the education of their children. 
More and more, our local school boards, our teachers, and our local schools are being suffocated by a tide of papers, forms, and programs, each of which have a good purpose, at least in theory, but the net result of which is to make it difficult to set priorities in each of the many varied school districts in the United States as to what will best serve the students of those districts. 
I am firmly of the belief, and I know my friend from New Mexico shares this belief with me, that elected school board members in cities and towns through the State of New Mexico, through the State of Washington, through the State of Colorado and all across the country, are dedicated to providing the best possible education for those schoolchildren that they possibly can and that they are better able to make decisions about what is best for their students than our bureaucrats in the Department of Education in Washington, DC, or than are Members of Congress. 
It is almost unspeakably arrogant of us here in this body that we set detailed requirements for very specific education programs all across the United States with the great variety of people, attitudes, and challenges that we have. 
So this amendment is designed to consolidate, for this year at least, the great bulk of all of the dozens or more programs fitting in the narrow categories going to school districts of the United States; to set up a reasonably fair formula which benefits the poorer States slightly more than it does the wealthy States, but with the exception of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, Impact Aid, and a number of other very high profile programs; that each school district should be allowed to take the money that we appropriate in this bill for the education of our children from kindergarten through 12th grade, and each school district should set its own priorities for the spending of that money on that education, trusting they can do a better job than we can or than the bureaucrats can. 
Not the least of the benefits of an amendment of this sort, Mr. President, is the fact that we will not have to take 10 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent off the top for administering the program, for filling out the forms, for all of the activities which chew up money but are not reflected in education at all. 
Mr. President, I present this as a significant amendment to this bill. I hope for a significant debate on this issue here in this body. We all, when we are at home, laud local control of our schools, with elected school board members and hands-on education, but all too much of the time we take exactly the opposite view in the programs we actually create and vote for here. 
This amendment will be discussed at considerably greater length tomorrow by a wide variety of people. I cannot possibly express my delight at having my friend from New Mexico as a cosponsor of this amendment. I suspect, Mr. President, there will be a number of other cosponsors as we go through the debate on the amendment tomorrow.

Mr. GORTON. Well, my friend, the Senator from New Mexico, whose views are so thoughtful and so carefully enunciated on a wide variety of subjects, is, I am afraid, more eloquent on my own amendment than I am myself. 
Yes, I say to my friend from New Mexico, that is exactly what this is about. 
Earlier this year, during the course of the debate over the budget, there was a request by the President that we increase the amount of money going to our common schools. That received wide support from both Republicans and Democrats in this body and in the House of Representatives. 
The Senator from New Mexico is entirely correct, there is nothing in this bill except more money. There is nothing in this bill about a different approach. There is nothing in this bill about getting more in the way of a 21st century education for our children. It is just more of the same stuff we have already been doing. 
I think I can say this amendment may, to a certain extent, be analogous to the welfare reform bill that we passed more than a year ago. What we decided then, I say to my friend from New Mexico, was that maybe we did not know everything there was to know about welfare here in Washington, DC. Maybe there was not just one welfare system, to be run out of Washington, DC, that was going to work. In fact, it worked so poorly that almost every condition it was designed to alleviate it made worse. 
What we did a year ago with welfare was to say we are not all that smart. Governors and legislators of 50 States, you try it. We will give you broad discretion in welfare programs. We suspect some of you will do really well, but regrettably some of you will do not so well, but we will learn more about what can get people back to work and out of a welfare mentality. 
Now, I think this amendment is a little bit like that, I say to my friend. What we are doing here is something we do not like doing very much in the Senate, admitting that somebody else may know a little bit more than we do about a subject. Here we are saying we think perhaps that wisdom lies right down in individual school districts with teachers in the classroom, with principals in the schools, with school board members who, almost without exception, are public-spirited citizens who have run for election for a job that does not pay, but that they know something maybe that we do not know, and if we give them more freedom to use these billions of dollars we come up with, we will get better education for our kids. 
That is, of course, the whole goal of the exercise.

Mr. GORTON. The Senator from New Mexico is, of course, entirely correct. The total amount of the appropriation in this bill for education is not reduced by a single dollar. 
On the other hand, the total amount of money that gets to the classroom will be considerably greater because so much less will get lost in the gears of administration at two, three, or four different levels between here and the classroom. 
We hope that we will be able to get much more for the same amount of money fundamentally because we will actually be spending more on direct educational expenditures.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago, Congress and the President agreed to provide $48 billion over the next 10 years as an incentive to States to provide health care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To receive this money, States must expand eligibility levels to children living in families with incomes up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. 
Three years ago, Washington State decided to do what Congress and the President have now required other States to do. In 1994, my State expanded children's health care coverage to children through age 18 who live in families up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. 
Under the budget agreement, Washington State, like every other State will receive an allotment, a portion of the money the Federal Government makes available for children's health care each year. The budget agreement provides an `enhanced Federal match' to States to encourage them to raise eligibility levels. That incentive is available to States which cover kids at the current mandatory levels of 100 percent to 133 percent of poverty depending on the age group, if they expand up to the new 200-percent-of-poverty threshold. However, for the few States which already meet this requirement, these States must expand their eligibility levels an additional 50 percentage points before being able to tap into the money available under the Children's Health Initiative. 
Unfortunately, the budget provisions essentially penalize Washington because of the State's progressive policies on children's health care. First, Washington and a few States which have done these broad expansions, will essentially pay more than every other State to cover this population of kids. Second, the budget agreement actually provides more incentive to cover kids in families with higher discretionary income than it does for children living in poorer families. In Washington 100,000 kids under 200 percent of poverty are still uninsured in spite of the success of enrolling kids over the last 3 years, while somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 kids between 200 and 250 percent of poverty are uninsured. Clearly the need is at lower income levels, I expect this holds true for most other States. Yet my State receives more Federal money to cover kids in this higher income bracket. Finally, the budget agreement provides no incentive to the State legislature to further expand coverage to kids. After all, Washington already did what Congress is now asking other States to do and instead of being recognized for doing a good job of covering kids, my State is penalized. If I were a State legislator I would argue that we should simply wait for the Feds to mandate further coverage for children, then we would receive the same contribution from the Federal Government as other States. 
For example, Washington currently receives a 50-percent Federal match for kids covered under Medicaid. Another State which also gets a 50-percent Federal match but has not already expanded eligibility levels for kids, will receive an enhanced match as an incentive to cover this new population. In a nonexpansion State for a child living in a family with an income of 150 percent the State would receive an increased Federal match level. However, under the budget agreement in a State like Washington, for that same child the State would only be reimbursed at the current rate. Even if the child is currently uninsured. Proportionately more money will come out of Washington State revenues to cover kids below 200 percent of the poverty than in other States which have not expanded coverage to kids at this level. Thus taxpayers in my State will pay more to cover the same population of kids than taxpayers in other States that did not choose to expand eligibility to kids before Congress did it for them. 
The spirit of the legislation is to provide health insurance coverage for uninsured, low-income children first. In Washington we have 100,000 kids that are uninsured below the 200 percent FPL threshold and only 10,000 to 30,000 between 200 percent and 250 percent FPL. For States with high eligibility thresholds, the Child Health Initiative provides more incentive--a higher Federal match rate--to cover kids at higher income levels than it does for kids living in families with lower incomes. With an enhanced match for new kids below 200 percent of FPL brought into the State health program, the State can target a bigger pool of low-income, uninsured kids, more expediently producing the results intended by the legislation. 
My amendment stays within the spirit of the Child Health Initiative, it focuses Federal money on providing health care coverage to new, uninsured children at low income levels first. It does not take money from any other State, but merely allows Washington to draw on its own allotment. Staff discussions with CBO and CRS confirm that the amendment does not change the amount other States will receive. CRS is in the process of developing an official memo to that effect. A progressive think tank, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also states that the amendment would not alter State allocations. The amendment allows States which have already expanded eligibility levels to 200 percent to receive an `enhanced Federal match' if it provides health care coverage to uninsured kids between the current mandatory levels and the new level of 200 percent set in the budget agreement. Additionally, my State would be required to maintain its current effort. Washington must spend the same amount on children's health care that it does in fiscal year 1997, in subsequent years before it can receive any money provided for under the Child Health Initiative. 
The proposal does not take money from other States nor does it provide additional Federal subsidies for children the State is now covering, it simply allows Washington and the other few expansion States to continue to do the good work they have already started.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on October 25, 1994, Jered Gamache lost his life, and his brother, Andy, was seriously injured on their way home from school when a Yakama tribal police officer, driving at 68 miles per hour, ran through a red light and crashed into their truck. Jered was 18 and Andy was 16. Despite the loss of Jered's life and the injuries to Andrew, the Gamache family has been totally unable to seek damages against the Yakama tribal government for the actions of its police officer. 
Now, let us compare this situation, Mr. President, to the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who was brutalized a few weeks ago by New York City police officers. According to the New York Times, in addition to the ongoing criminal investigation, Mr. Louima's attorneys are planning to file a $465 million civil damage suit against New York City. 
Now, Mr. President, what makes the case of Jered and Andy Gamache different from the case of Abner Louima? The answer is simple: Tribal sovereign immunity. Unlike New York City, the Yakama tribal government can claim immunity from any civil lawsuit, including suits involving public safety and bodily harm, in both State and Federal courts. As a consequence, the lawyers retained by the Gamache family have told them it is pointless to bring any kind of lawsuit. They have no recourse. 
New York City does not have sovereign immunity, and thus, of course, is subject to a lawsuit in any amount of money on the part of victims of malfeasance, on the part of members of its police department. 
A few weeks ago, up until the present time, the New York Times has run articles and editorials showcasing the Louima case as an example of police brutality and the need for permanent reform. While that case has sparked outrage from editorialists in New York and elsewhere, last Sunday the New York Times vilified my efforts to provide exactly the same avenue for relief to the Gamache family as the New York Times eloquently advocates for Mr. Louima. The New York Times has decided that while it is unacceptable for New York City to brutalize a person, it rejects non-Indians' right to bring similar claims against tribal police agencies in the U.S. courts. So we have 18- and 16-year-old victims who have no recourse. 
Enormous injustices can be done whenever a technical claim can prevent the adjudication of a just claim on the part of an individual against a government. It is for exactly that reason that the doctrine of sovereign immunity was long ago dropped by the Federal Government and the State government in cases of this nature. 
Let us consider another case, Mr. President, the case of Sally Matsch. When she was fired from an American Indian casino in Minnesota she felt that she was a victim of age discrimination, so she sued the Prairie Island Indian Tribe. The tribe, however, invoked its sovereign immunity against lawsuits in State or Federal courts, and her case was heard by an Indian court on the second floor of the casino and was dismissed amid the sounds of slot machines by a judge who served at the pleasure of the tribal council that ran the casino. 
Seventeen years ago I was attorney general of the State of Washington. I brought a lawsuit that asserted the right of the State of Washington to tax the sale of cigarettes in Indian smoke shops to non-Indians. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld our position that those sales were taxable. For all practical purposes, however, in the 17 years since that time, States have been unable to enforce a right that the Supreme Court of the United States said they had because they cannot sue the tribe or the tribal business entities in order to collect those taxes or to enforce their collection. Why? Tribal sovereign immunity. 
Barbara Lindsey, Mr. President, is president of an organization of Puget Sound beach property owners in Washington State. In 1989, 16 Indian tribes sued those property owners in the State of Washington claiming that `treaty rights' gave them the right to enter private property to remove clams and oysters. A Federal district court in large measure has accepted that claim, but Barbara Lindsey and the thousands of property owners she represents, Mr. President, cannot sue the Indian tribes for violations of their property rights, even in cases when those violations are obvious and open. The problem? Tribal sovereign immunity. 
So, Mr. President, this body will debate next week when it debates the Interior appropriations bill a provision that for a period of 1 year, as a rider on the appropriations bill, requires the waiver of tribal sovereign immunity on the part of those tribes--and I believe it is all of them--whose governmental entities, whose police forces, are being funded by money appropriated by the Congress out of the taxes collected from all of the American people. The proposal does not change any substantive laws. It simply says if, in fact, the law has been violated, there should be a remedy in a neutral Federal court--we have not extended it to State courts--but in a neutral Federal court. 
Is it fair to prevent a family from seeking justice for the wrongful death of their son? Is it fair that a claim of age discrimination cannot be made or decided in a neutral court? Is it fair that a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on taxes cannot effectively be enforced? It is not, Mr. President, and claims that sovereignty is somehow undercut by saying that the sovereign is subject to the laws is simply not the case. 
The claim of those who believe we should make no change is a claim that an Indian tribe can act in a totally lawless fashion and not be held responsible in any court of the United States for those lawless actions. 
It can be dressed up in whatever fancy language about sovereignty that one may propose, but it comes right down to that proposition: Is it fair that if you are injured by a New York City policeman you can sue New York City, 
but if you are injured by a Yakama tribal police officer, you may not sue its tribe. The doctrine is one that stems from the kings of England. It is an anachronism in today's world. Under constitutional guarantees of due process to every American citizen, every American citizen should be granted the opportunity to bring his or her case in a neutral court and get an answer as to whether or not crimes have, in fact, been committed. The only issue that will be involved in this case is, Should any government be permitted to act in an entirely lawless fashion and not be called to account for its acts? The answer to that question is `no'. We should not be involved in that kind of action, and the only body with constitutional authority to make that decision across this United States is the Congress of the United States. The buck stops here.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am dismayed by the decision made Monday by the Mexican Government to impose a 101.1 percent tariff on U.S. Red Delicious and Golden Delicious apples effective September 1. This tariff increase has been imposed in response to an antidumping claim filed by Chihuahua apple growers against U.S. growers earlier this year. Ignoring significant evidence to the contrary, the Mexican Government has issued a preliminary determination that U.S. growers are selling apples in Mexico at half their fair price. 
The Mexican Government's determination is wrong. U.S. apple growers have not engaged in dumping. It appears that Mexican officials have virtually ignored the documentation submitted by the U.S. apple industry proving that U.S. apple growers are exporting apples at a fair price. The allegations made by Mexico are ludicrous and the tariff increase unjustified. 
As many of my colleagues know, my home State of Washington is the Nation's largest apple producer, and Mexico is the largest market for our apples. This drastic tariff increase will devastate the United States apple industry while allowing Mexican growers, with no competition, to charge exceedingly high prices for their apples. 
Together with my colleagues from Oregon and Idaho, I call on the administration to take immediate action on this issue. We cannot allow Mexico to undermine the United States apple industry with these unfair, protectionist trade practices.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to recognize an Explorer Scout whose bravery and quick thinking saved the life of his friend. On July 3, 1997, a group of friends went swimming near Sunset Falls in Yacolt, WA. Recent flooding had altered the depth of the water where the friends chose to go diving. Not recognizing the change in depth, Kade Vance dove from a rock into the natural pool below. Moments later, he surfaced in a dead man's float, bleeding from his head. Robby Loomis, a trained Explorer Scout, immediately swam to his friend's aid and turned him on his back to allow him to breathe. Robby conversed with Kade, making sure he remained conscious. Kade indicated he could not feel his legs and that his strength was quickly deteriorating. 
For more than 40 minutes, Robby kept Kade afloat in water that was only 60 degrees. Despite his dropping temperature and diminishing strength, Robby helped move Kade closer to shore where the emergency medical team could reach them. Robby used his own body as a shield to protect his injured friend from further damage by rocks near the shoreline. As a result of Robby Loomis' courageous efforts, and due to his Explorer Scout training, Kade Vance's life was saved. I would like to recognize the bravery and heroism displayed by Robby Loomis and congratulate him on his valiant efforts.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on all too many occasions in this body, we have been a part of debates, pointing fingers over failure, over a failure to balance the budget, over a failure to meet the needs of the American people. We are in a competition again here today, but it is a far more pleasant competition. It is competition for credit for a success. It is my view that there is plenty of praise to go around for that success, from the Republicans and Democrats to the leadership of the Congress and to the President of the United States. 
I believe we have heeded the counsel of the people of the United States who were not willing to trust either party last November with full control over the Federal Government, and demanded that we work together and craft solutions to the challenges facing the American people. So we have passed a bill that will lead us to a balanced budget. And so we are about to pass a bill that will: Give needed and overdue tax relief to the American people; a credit to most hard-working American families of $500 for each of their children 16 years old and under; credit and relief for the expenses of higher education to those same hard-working middle-class American citizens; relief from the savage impacts of the death tax on small businesses and on farms; help for the self-employed, in paying for the rising cost of health care insurance; relief from burdensome taxation on the sale of homes or the sale of other assets that will lead to more investment and to better jobs and opportunities for the future; encouragements to save. 
Mr. President, is this the last answer to each of these challenges, to all of our challenges? It is not. I share with the Senator from New York, the Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from Rhode Island, disappointment that we missed this opportunity, an opportunity granted by the courage of Members of both parties in this Senate, to deal with the underlying challenges to Medicare and to an aging population. But we did find that we could debate those issues and vote on those issues constructively and positively in this Senate. I believe we have built a base on which that debate will be renewed next year, one hopes with real opportunities for success. 
We did not simplify the Tax Code in this bill by any stretch of the imagination, but I believe we built a foundation upon which we can debate next year over whether or not we ought to dramatically simplify and make more fair and easy to understand and easy to comply with, our tax system. But the fact that we didn't do everything should not detract from the fact that we did something. We have moved dramatically forward toward a balanced budget, and dramatically forward toward tax relief for the American people. 
This is a partnership program for which much credit is due very widely and across both parties. I trust that partnership will be recognized by an overwhelming vote of approval tomorrow morning.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to address a provision in the reconciliation bill that deals with spectrum. In an ill-advised concession, the Senate accepted a partial waiver of the duopoly and newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership restrictions that will allow broadcasters and newspaper owners in cities with populations over 400,000 to bid for the returned `analog' spectrum in those markets. I believe this simply is bad policy. As plainly explained in the report, the Senate, like the House--that originally sought an even broader waiver--put revenue concerns first. First, and ahead of what I believe to be graver concerns for the intellectual wealth and benefits that accrue from a diversity of voices and opinions in a marketplace. 
Fortunately, although we have, in my view, compromised unacceptably, we have not done so unqualifiedly. The final bill provides for a waiver of the duopoly and newspaper-broadcaster cross ownership ban only in cases of cities of over 400,000. Moreover, the bill provides only a one-time waiver, only in large markets, which are likely to have more (and more diverse) media, and only under circumstances (the auction of `duplicate' spectrum) in which the number of broadcast voices could double.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Jane Garvey's confirmation as Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA]. 
As the new FAA Administrator, Ms. Garvey is facing significant challenges. These challenges include ensuring that air travel is safe, that the modernization of the air traffic control system is done on time and on budget, and that airport development keeps pace with the expected significant increases in passengers and cargo. Ms. Garvey also faces a significant challenge to independently assess aviation funding needs, and to speak out as to what the true needs are. 
We are counting on Ms. Garvey to provide strong leadership. Many positive statements have been made about her tenure at the Federal Highway Administration, and about her outstanding management skills and strong financial experience. These qualities will serve Ms. Garvey well in running the FAA, and in working with the Congress. 
I have heard a great deal about the need to change how things are done at the FAA, and some of Ms. Garvey's past accomplishments indicate that she is up to the task. I understand that one of her most noteworthy accomplishments at the Federal Highway Administration was to help implement innovative financing options to accelerate completion of highway projects and to leverage federal funds. Through her efforts, unnecessary restrictions were cleared away, and program flexibility was provided that allowed good ideas to be introduced. Such actions show that she can look beyond business as usual, and see opportunities to make improvements. Such creativity is needed at the FAA. 
I am sure that no one needs to be reminded that aviation safety is the paramount responsibility of the FAA. I expect Ms. Garvey to take whatever reasonable action is necessary to see that the FAA is proactive, and makes whatever changes are needed before, not after, an airline accident occurs. The public expects and deserves nothing less. 
Ms. Garvey will be the first FAA Administrator to have a fixed 5-year term. The Congress established this term so that the FAA would have the continuity and direction that its complex, technical, and costly programs require. Ms. Garvey has made a public commitment that she will stay for the full 5 years of her term. I would encourage her to keep this commitment. 
I look forward to working with Ms. Garvey to address the needs of the nation's aviation system, and to see that it continues to be the safest, most efficient system in the world. I wish Ms. Garvey great success. I would join with Senator McCain in urging this body to quickly confirm Ms. Garvey as the next Administrator of the FAA. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation for the excellent job he has done on this bill, and in particular for the priority he has given to airports. The chairman has been very accommodating in looking out for the interests of Washington State. There is one program, however, that we did not address in this bill, and I would like to seek the chairman's assistance in seeing that the issue can be raised in conference. Paine Field in Everett, WA, is currently the third busiest airport in the State. In addition to being the airport from which Boeing tests its 747, 767, and 777 aircraft, I understand that a commercial airline has indicated its interest in operating from Paine Field. Despite the growing traffic, Paine Field does not have a radar system, and air traffic controllers currently use binoculars and reports from pilots to determine the positions of aircraft relative to each other. 
I understand that while most radar air traffic control systems can be quite expensive, there is a new system that is far less costly and could be appropriate for testing at airports like Paine Field. This technology, called the terminal automated radar display and information system, or TARDIS, essentially reproduces in the air traffic control tower, radar images generated elsewhere. In the case of Paine Field, the data may be obtained from nearby Fort Lawton. 
While it remains to be seen whether this TARDIS system is, in fact, appropriate for Paine Field, I would appreciate the chairman's assistance in revisiting this issue in conference with an eye to including report language urging the FAA to give full consideration to installing a TARDIS system at Paine Field.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we here in the Congress and the White House seem at this point to be on the verge of an agreement which will pay two magnificent dividends to the American people. 
The first is the promise of a balanced budget, not just one time, not just on a touch-and-go basis, but perhaps with a sufficient number of reforms on spending policies so that we can reasonably expect a balanced budget for a considerable period of time in the future. 
Even the promise of that balanced budget, Mr. President, a promise made 2 years ago by the first Republican Congress, has been largely responsible for interest rates, on average, to be 1 1/2 percentage points lower than they were when that Congress came into being. For a middle-class family with an $80,000 mortgage and $15,000 automobile loan, that means $100 more a month for the family to use or to save or to spend on its own rather than on interest payments. 
Beyond that, Mr. President, it means that the United States will have substantially ended the practice of spending money that it did not have year after year after year, borrowing that money and sending the bill to our children and to our grandchildren. 
The second wonderful dividend which we seem about to present to the American people is tax relief. Just 4 years ago, perhaps to the month, we were here debating--and on this side of the aisle opposing unsuccessfully--what turned out to be the largest tax increase, measured in dollars, in the history of the United States. 
Today, that debate, that idea is buried, if not forgotten. And we have changed the entire direction of the debate here from how much more can we spend and how much more can we tax to how can we limit the spending habits of the Government of the United States and what kind of dividend in the form of tax relief can we return to the American people. 
We now talk about tax relief rather than about tax increases. The debate over what kind of tax relief, Mr. President, has obscured the profound nature of the change in this debate. It is all too easy to forget that it has only been for the last 2 years that we have seriously been debating tax relief. My friend and colleague from Georgia just pointed out, quite accurately, that this will be the first tax relief for the American people in more than a decade and a half. 
Mr. President, many may say that this tax relief proposal is modest. And modest it is. It is perhaps one-third as large as the 1993 tax increase. And so it is only a first step, at least as far as we here on this side of the aisle are concerned. But there will be very real tax relief for hard-working, middle-class citizens of the United States, families with children, very real tax relief from the burden of capital gains taxation, a form of tax relief which will certainly increase savings and investment and career opportunities for Americans today and for future generations of America as well, with tax relief in the field of estate taxation, a particularly vicious form of taxation that penalizes success, breaks up small businesses, requires farms to be sold and undercuts some of the most important bases upon which a successful American economy has been built. 
No, Mr. President, since we began this campaign, this crusade with the new Republican Congress just a little bit more than 2 years ago, interest rates have declined, real hourly wages are moving up after 2 years of decline at the beginning of the first Clinton administration, millions of new jobs are in existence, unemployment is as low as it has been in decades. 
Mr. President, it is appropriate to say that we are on the verge of success because we have been able to work together. We have listened to the demand that the American people made by their votes less than a year ago that a Republican Congress work with a Democratic President in order to see to it the budget was balanced and tax relief was made available to the American people. 
We, on this side of the aisle, are delighted at our success in changing the nature of the debate from how much more Government shall we have and how much more shall we pay for it, to how can we discipline the Government's demand for money and how can we provide tax relief for the American people. 
One success, however, Mr. President, I submit, has a real opportunity to lead to another. And so I trust that this quiet Monday will lead to a challenging week, and that by the end of the week a promise made more than 2 years ago on a balanced budget and tax relief for the American people will have been fulfilled. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, there can be no serious argument posed to Members in body that it is not appropriate, maybe beyond appropriate, for all practical purposes necessary, for the proper administration of justice that the U.S. Court of Appeals--almost twice as large as the next largest court of appeals and almost three times as large in population and in caseload as the average circuit--should not be divided. 
Twenty-three years ago, a commission, the Hruska Commission, said the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was too large and should be divided; that no circuit court of appeals should have more than 15 judges. The reasons, of course, is collegiality, the prompt and effective administration of justice. Any other argument is simply a matter of delay, simply a matter of a maintenance of the status quo. 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should be divided. There have been bills on this subject and hearings on this subject in most of the Congresses from 1975, 22 years ago, to date. The very proposal that is before us right now, with minor changes, was recommended by the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress and did not come to a vote because it was clear that it would be filibustered as an independent vote. That is at least one of the reasons that when he comes to the floor, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will recommend the rejection of this amendment and supports the division that is included in this bill. 
But, Mr. President, before I get back to the merits of the proposal, I want to express my deep concern over some portions of the opposition that come to this bill from California and perhaps elsewhere. One of the reasons that the Senator from California can describe this bill as a gerrymander, one of the reasons that she 
can call for delay is because the proponents of the division have acceded to the requests of the Senators from the various States that are affected by this division. 
Should we have another study commission? That study commission, if it is remotely objective, will recommend the division of the ninth circuit not into two, but into three new circuits, a proposition that this Senator feels to be highly appropriate. The only way to create three new circuits out of the present ninth circuit is to divide the State of California and to place it into two circuits: one centered in San Francisco, the other centered in Los Angeles. 
That recommendation has been with us for many years. That recommendation was incorporated into the first version of this bill. The two Senators from California are vehemently opposed to that recommendation, and I strongly suspect that if we go 2 years and have another study commission and it comes up with dividing California, they will find a reason to object to it again and to filibuster the proposal. 
So what did the sponsors of the division do? The sponsors of the division said, `Fine, we will accede to the wishes of the Senators from California. We will make this a two-new-circuit bill.' California will be left united. 
The Senators from Nevada, with some real justice with respect to the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee 2 years ago, stated that they didn't like the division; that Nevada felt more drawn to California than it did to the Pacific Northwest and Arizona. And so in this bill, we have acceded to the wishes of the Senators from Nevada and have left that State in the ninth circuit with the State of California. 
That is the reason that the circuit, as it appears in the bill, is not contiguous. But in the days of the Internet, of e-mail, of faxes, of air transportation, there is nothing but history to require that circuits be made up of contiguous States. And, of course, Alaska and Hawaii have never been contiguous to the States in the ninth circuit. Nor has Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to the circuits to which they are attached. 
Finally, the State of Hawaii, through its Senators, when it was determined there was to be a bill, elected, to my delight, Mr. President, that it would rather be in the smaller, the more intimate, the more collegial circuit, the new twelfth, and that appears in the bill. Then when we asked the representatives of Guam and the trust territories of the Pacific, they said, while they really don't want to change that, of course, they prefer to stay with Hawaii. 
If the great majority of the Senators from the Northwest and from Arizona wish a new circuit that is so logical, and if they have deferred to the wishes of the Senators from Colorado and Nevada as to their desires, why should we say no on the floor of the Senate to those who wish the division? What business is it of the Governor of California to tell us how the ninth circuit should be constituted? I am deeply troubled that Senators whose own wishes, reflecting what they think is best for their States, have been respected, refuse so arbitrarily as they and their predecessors have for more than two decades to accede to ours. 
Mr. President, there are 28 positions authorized for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. There are 10 more requested by those judges and approved by the Judicial Council. That is a collegial circuit? At the number 28, three-judge panels that are chosen by lot have 3,276 possible combinations of those three judges. You, Mr. President, one of the youngest of our Members, could be appointed to the ninth circuit, could serve on it for 30 years, and the chances are you would never serve on the same panel of three twice in that entire period of time. That is collegiality? 
The ninth circuit is slow from the time appeals are filed until they are decided. It is notoriously reversed more frequently than in the case of any other circuit. When I was attorney general of the State of Washington, we figured that if we could get the Supreme Court of the United States to take certiorari from the ninth circuit, we had at least a 75-percent chance of winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, of causing it to repeal the circuit. 
At one level, that is not a totally relevant argument, because the two new circuits would start with exactly the same judges they have now, and I can't note any difference in philosophy from those who come from the States in the old ninth circuit under this proposal and the new twelfth circuit, and, of course, they are nominated by the same Presidents and confirmed by the same Members of the U.S. Senate. But I suspect that if the judges who work together knew one another a little bit better than they do now, there would at least be a marginal improvement in the number of times during which they are reversed. 
Mr. President, there is simply no justification whatsoever for the maintenance of this huge and unwieldy circuit. The Senator from California said in 20 years, California itself will have 50 million people. We have a wonderful First Circuit Court of Appeals, much smaller than the twelfth we propose in this legislation. New York and Pennsylvania, that don't have the population of California combined, have always been in separate circuits, and they are both on the Atlantic Ocean, and they both have to deal with the same kind of admiralty law. 
No, Mr. President. The time has come. There have been hearings galore. Those hearings have occupied a quarter of a century. There have been bills reported. Another study, another delay, only to be followed by another attempt to delay after that when a three-circuit division is proposed. 
No, Mr. President. The time is now. The division is appropriate. It will not be the last in the history of the U.S. courts. But it seems to me we should go ahead. From a personal point of view, I am somewhat unhappy that while we have done all we can to accommodate California, California refuses to accommodate us.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from California makes a serious argument: we should not split the circuits because we will waste the $140 million investment in a courthouse in San Francisco, except that we can split the circuits if this so-called study commission says we should do so, and she would then have no objection. 
Well, either the courthouse is an important consideration, or it is not an important consideration. Obviously, Mr. President, it is not an important consideration. I presume--I hope--that the Senator from California is not arguing that, even if there is a split, all of the staff and all of the people who are now in that courthouse in San Francisco would still be there and everything has to be added onto that. That is often a way in which the Federal bureaucracy operates. But there is no reason in the world for us to allow it to operate in that fashion under this set of circumstances. 
This can be done efficiently and effectively. But that is the fundamental argument against this amendment and in favor of the bill as it stands. The ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee said that this is the wrong way to act. The Senator from California says this is the wrong way to act because it is on an appropriations bill. 
Yet, 2 years ago when a bill practically identical to this was reported by the Judiciary Committee, after full hearings and a full debate, they objected to it even being debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Now for the first time we have an opportunity to do so. 
This Senator has favored this flip since the early 1980's. And this is the first time we have ever been able so much as to debate it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
The arguments against the proposal for split are essentially procedural. `Oh, no, we have not had enough hearings. We have not talked about it for a long enough time. There have not been enough study commissions.' 
There have been hearings for decades. There has been a debate for decades. It simply cannot be argued in any kind of rationale manner that a circuit with this number of States, with 14 million square miles of land and water, with almost 50 million people growing more rapidly than any other part of the country, with 28 authorized judges at the present time, 10 more requested on top of that, can be a collegial body, a court that can understand the cases that come in front of it, a court in which the members can even learn the names of the other members of the court. 
Of course a division is appropriate, and the division that is being discussed here today is the division, if there is to be one, that the Senators in opposition asked for. 
We are criticized because the bill changed in form as it got in front of us. Well, California is not divided because the Senators from California ask that it not be divided. And we went along. 
Nevada remains a part of the ninth circuit because the Senators from Nevada asked that that be the case as against the bill that was reported 2 years ago. 
Hawaii and the trust territories are with the new twelfth circuit because, assuming a division, that is where they wanted to be. 
Yes, there have been changes, but they have been changes requested by the very Senators who are here on the floor arguing against the result of their requests. Justice in these circuit courts will be done better in circuits that are roughly similar to the other circuits--all of the other circuits in the United States. Each of these circuits will still have more square miles than any other, except for, I believe it is the tenth in the Mountain States, and more when you include Alaska. The ninth circuit will still be the largest of any and all of them. 
I don't believe this is going to be the last such division. But it is a division whose time came almost a quarter of a century ago. And that has been resisted by lawyers and judges who are comfortable with the present situation, with the wonderful travel opportunities they have, and rank that convenience ahead of the convenience of individuals seeking justice before those courts who can be served far better, far closer to home, with far more understanding, if this division becomes law, than if we simply say, `Oh, let's wait. Let's have another study. And let's let that study come up with the same results we did before. And then we will have another excuse to oppose the division.' 
That is what we got when we heard, on the one hand, `Fine, let's have the study, and we will agree with it. But, no, we can't divide the circuit because we have a brandnew $140 million courthouse in San Francisco.' 
No, Mr. President, it is time for the Senate of the United States to deal with this question as a matter of substance today. It is time to do justice. It is time to reject this amendment and pass this bill. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the European Community is engaged in the blatant misuse of its authority to review United States mergers shamelessly to protect Airbus Industrie. It has decided that it will use its authority to block the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. Its rationale is that the combined commercial aircraft company poses too great a risk to Airbus Industrie. 
For the past 25 years, America has watched the Europeans pour billions of dollars of subsidies into Airbus Industrie to create what is now without question a highly competitive aircraft company. Airbus Industrie today boasts more than 30 percent of the global market for large jet transports. Its goal is to have 50 percent of the market and it is aggressively pursuing that goal. Many of us were shocked with French President Chirac's shameless pursuit of aircraft orders in China in exchange for the French's Government's commitment to defeat a U.N. human rights resolution. 
Airbus Industrie has already destroyed the viability of the Douglas Aircraft Co. Airbus' market share has come largely at the expense of McDonnell Douglas, which last year had only 4 percent of the market. Now the Europeans, in a final blow to Douglas, want the Boeing Co. to divest itself of Douglas Aircraft Co. and put the 14,000 remaining Douglas employees out on the street. 
While most Americans will find it inconceivable, the Europeans do in fact have the legal authority to block this American merger. This is true even though neither Boeing nor McDonnell Douglas have significant operations in Europe and despite the fact that our own Government has thoroughly reviewed the merger and approved it without conditions. 
The Europeans have disregarded our own exhaustive review process in the United States. 
The Boeing Co. has engaged in a good-faith effort to try to address the concerns raised by the European Commission about the merger--but to no avail. Nevertheless, the EC plans to block the merger. This means that Boeing aircraft may well be prevented from being sold in Europe. 
From the very beginning, the European merger review proceedings have been dominated by the political considerations of the Airbus member sales. I warned the President about this in a May letter on this subject. My colleagues in the Senate supported my sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the subject last week. 
The United States can no longer stand aside and allow Europe blatantly to protect Airbus at the expense of our own civil aircraft industry and our own American employees. The administration should send a clear signal that it will not allow this type of protectionism to continue and that we will retaliate decisively if the Europeans block the merger. 
The European Commission's indifference to appropriate antitrust considerations and its undisguised protectionism was expressed candidly by the EC's Karl Van Miert on Tuesday, July 15 on Belgian radio: `The EC does not want a competitive market, it wants a guaranteed market.'

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today to correct an egregious problem at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and on tribal lands across the Nation that came to light last December. As many of my colleagues know, the Seattle Times broke an unbelievable story of greed, deception, and mismanagement in the tribal housing program shortly before the 105th Congress convened. 
The Seattle Times reported that funding intended to build housing for low-income native Americans on the Tulalip Reservation in my State, went instead to construct a 5,300 square foot $400,000 home. The recipients of this taxpayer-funded home were not low-income, but instead earned a combined yearly income of $92,319 as executive director of the tribe's housing authority and contracting officer for the authority. I am confident my colleagues will agree that this abuse of HUD funding is outrageous and should be punished severely. 
Unfortunately, the Tulalip house was not the only problem Seattle Times reporters found in their 6-month investigation of tribal housing programs. Instead, they turned up numerous and repeated examples of cheating, abuse, and mismanagement in native American housing programs across the United States. 
In Red Rock, OK, Troy Warrior and his family of the Otoe-Missouria Indian tribe were excited at the prospect of moving into a new home. They would finally be able to afford their own home with help from HUD financing. Only a few days before the family was scheduled to move into the modest home, they were told that leaders of the tribal housing authority would get the house instead. Twenty other low-income families in the tribe faced the same dilemma. The tribal housing leaders eliminated the requirement that recipients of the homes pay for them, in effect giving themselves free houses at the expense of American taxpayers while those truly in need of the housing were left to fend for themselves. 
Jimmy Viarrial, chairman of the Pojoaque Tribe housing authority in Santa Fe, NM, makes over $40,000 a year, twice the State average. But when HUD gave the housing authority $1 million for home repairs, it spent the first $45,000 on Viarrial's own five-bedroom home. Most of the rest went to remodel the homes of friends and relatives of Viarrial and the housing authority director. 
Mr. President, these are just a few of the many abuses found by Seattle Times reporters last year, and I can say with confidence that there are most likely many more such abuses that have not been discovered. The American taxpayers deserve better than this. When we in the U.S. Senate tell them that their money is going to worthwhile programs to provide housing for the poorest native Americans, it is our duty to ensure that it is. 
As many of you know, two officials at the Department of Housing and Urban Development were removed from their positions in the Office of Native American Programs as a result of this scandal. Furthermore, the HUD inspector general has issued a report confirming that the Seattle Times allegations are in fact true and recommending that the Native American Housing and Self-Determination Act of 1996 be amended to ensure better oversight of Indian housing authorities at HUD. These are positive developments that should be applauded. But no actions have been taken against the tribes responsible for the abuse of taxpayer money. 
That is why I am offering an amendment today intended to send notice that the misuse and misallocation of taxpayer dollars will no longer be tolerated. It will be punished and punished severely. Anyone involved will be permanently barred from participating in the program, and must reimburse that program. I would have preferred to go further, but this amendment is the strongest that can be accepted and passed. It is a simple amendment that should have been law a long time ago. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to inject fairness and accountability into a program rife with abuse and mismanagement. It is the least we can do for the millions of American taxpayers who expect their hard-earned money to be used wisely.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson, has offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment today regarding the President's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading status to the People's Republic of China for another year. Mr. Hutchinson believes the President's decision was wrong and would like to see MFN for China withdrawn. While I share my colleagues concerns about MFN for China, I will not support his amendment today. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have grave reservations about the United States' policy of engagement with China. The President's decision to continue to provide China free and open access to the United States market and the House vote to approve that decision were, in my opinion, wrong. But, that is water under the bridge. Instead of arguing against a decision that has already been made, we should be looking forward to the MFN debate next year. 
My State of Washington is on the cutting edge of trade with China. We do more business with China than virtually any other State in the Nation and rely on that business for thousands of well-paying jobs. Despite our successes, the Chinese continue to impose protectionist trade barriers against Washington State products and play politics with our exports. My State is not alone in this dilemma. 
I firmly believe that the administration's policy of engagement is failing businesses throughout the United States. The United States trade deficit with China has now grown to $40 billion and is increasing every day. This is unacceptable, Mr. President. I challenge my colleagues to take a closer look at our policy of engagement with China and urge them to join me in fighting for a tougher trade policy next year. If we condition MFN on significant trade concessions from China next year, I am convinced that China will back down. 
Unless we stand firm against Chinese protectionism and condition MFN and access to the United States market on trade concessions from China, we will never reap the potential benefits of truly free trade with the world's largest emerging economy. 
So, Mr. President, I will vote against this amendment today, but look forward to working closely with my colleagues next year to change the way the United States does business with China.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee regarding an issue that has been underscored in the House report and deserves similar recognition within this distinguished body. The issue concerns the Department of Energy's program for disposition of excess weapons usable plutonium. This program, managed by the Department's Office of Fissile Materials Disposition, is an important cornerstone of international efforts related to arms reduction, nonproliferation, and world peace. It is a relatively new program within the Department, and one that deserves special recognition by this body and our unconditional support.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a last-minute amendment and I greatly appreciate the indulgence of the managers, but it is of vital importance. It now is increasingly evident, overwhelmingly evident, that the European Commission is going to attempt to reject the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas mergers in spite of the fact that the Department of Defense feels this is a significant step forward for our national defense, in spite of the fact the Federal Trade Commission has not determined there are any trade violations in connection therewith. 
That decision on the part of the European Commission seems to have been made in the absence of any evidence and before any evidence was submitted to it and solely on behalf of creating a competitive advantage for Airbus. If it should hold, it will have a seriously adverse impact on employment in the United States, particularly with the Douglas portion of McDonnell Douglas, which could not survive unaided or unmerged. 
This resolution simply states those facts and states that any such disapproval would be an unwarranted and unprecedented interference in a business decision appropriately made in the United States and suggests to the President he take such actions as he deems necessary under the circumstances. 
I will make more extensive remarks on this issue sometime tomorrow, but I appreciate the support of my colleagues on a matter of great importance to employees in many States throughout the United States.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last week the United States joined with our European allies to invite three nations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic are deserving of this invitation. I congratulate them on their achievements and look forward to a strong and lasting relationship with the people of these nations. 
Today I offer an amendment with my colleague, Senator Durbin, and the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator McConnell, to ensure that NATO expansion does not stop here. The Madrid summit was only the first step in our efforts to see to it that the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are brought firmly into democracy's camp. Further expansion of NATO is essential if democratic and economic reforms are to continue and if communism is to be eliminated entirely from the European Continent. 
My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should be invited to join NATO at the earliest possible date. These three tiny nations, perched between the Baltic Sea and the northwestern border of Russia, have made remarkable strides since they gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all made significant progress toward the NATO requirements of irreversible democracy, free market economies, and civilian-controlled militaries. They have even participated in NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative by supplying troops to NATO peacekeeping efforts. The Baltic nations have requested and deserve consideration for full NATO membership. 
From a history wrought with foreign interventions that tore them from their rightful place in the European mainstream and subjected them to the heavy hand of communism, the Baltics have emerged from the economic and political darkness to embrace democracy and the free market with unsurpassed vigor. If these nations are ever to continue on the road to democracy and economic reform, they must feel secure from the possibility of future foreign domination. The United States and NATO have an important role to play in providing that necessary security. 
Having traveled to Estonia twice in the past 5 years, I have a very personal interest in its entry into NATO. The people of Estonia, much like their Baltic neighbors, have been under foreign rule throughout history. They were ruled by Germans in the 13th century, Swedes in the 16th and 17th centuries, Tsarist Russia in the 19th century, and the Soviet Union after World War II. With the end of Soviet domination, Estonians and their neighbors in Latvia and Lithuania are looking to the West for confirmation of their right to independence. 
Unfortunately, the subject of NATO expansion to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania has become highly controversial. Many in the United States national security community believe the Baltics, lying so close to Russia and within the area Yeltsin considers to be Russia's sphere of influence, should not be considered for NATO membership. Out of fear of isolating Russia, the United States and our European allies may forsake the three tiny nations that did so much to promote the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eradication of communism throughout Eastern Europe. Now is the time for the United States take decisive action to rectify the past and protect the Baltics from any future foreign irredentism. 
Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is essential to their safety and prosperity. Security concerns will take precedence over continued democratic and economic reforms if the Baltics continue to exist, unprotected, in the shadow of an increasingly nationalistic Russia. 
We must be vigilant, Mr. President, in our efforts to extend NATO's reach to all democratic nations in Europe who cannot protect themselves. If we leave these nations exposed to the risk of foreign invasion and influence, the gains we made in expanding democracy and freedom across the globe will be vulnerable to erosion. 
The United States must continue to set an example for the world as a promoter and protector of democratic freedom. As victors in the cold war, we have never had a greater opportunity than this to show democracy's enemies that we have the courage and the will to stand firm against them. We should embrace this historic opportunity and bring every nation deserving of NATO membership into democracy's fold, even those nations closest to the heart of Russia. 
The people of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have been out in the cold long enough. They should be commended for the great strides they have made already toward the requirements for NATO membership and would make an outstanding contribution to stability, freedom, and peace in Europe as NATO members. It is time the West welcome them into NATO with open arms. 
I thank Senator McConnell and Senator Durbin for cosponsoring this important amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote `yes' on inclusion of the Baltics in NATO. 
Mr. President, to reiterate, this amendment was proposed by myself and by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, [Mr. Durbin], as an add-on a week or so ago to the defense authorization bill and was accepted by the Senate unanimously at that point. 
The Senator from Illinois and I, and I believe, with the happy assent of the manager of the bill, Senator McConnell, are presenting it, once again, in the glorious aftermath of last week's meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Madrid. 
At that meeting, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary were admitted to NATO. Several other nations who are applicants to NATO were not admitted but were put at least on the road toward meeting the qualifications for entrance into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Slovenia and Romania were put more or less at the front of that parade. But in Madrid, there were also represented the three small Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, small nations that have been independent for only a relatively short period during their long history. 
Unlike the other applicants for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, these three nations were, in fact, occupied by and incorporated into the Soviet Union from 1940, with a pause for German occupation, until just a very few years ago when they, once again, obtained their independence. None of those countries has any goal greater than being recognized as a part of the West, as being free countries, both politically and economically. No set of nations has been more oppressed by their neighbors than these three nations. None, I think, has a greater dedication to freedom, to liberty, to democracy, and to free markets. 
This amendment simply states that we hope that these countries will be carefully considered for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at such time as they have met all of its qualifications. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of course, was formed originally simply for the defense of the West, a task which was overwhelmingly successful. But as we note the response in the three countries about to be admitted, we find that the goals are psychic every bit as much as they relate to any kind of military defense. It ratifies the choices that these three new applicants made to be democracies, to be a part of the West, to care to attempt to catch up, to join what we consider to be the free and democratic world. 
Exactly those same feelings are found in the other applicant countries, exactly those feelings are found in the Baltics. 
This amendment is a modest way to encourage those three small nations to continue to move in the right direction by stating to them that when they are fully qualified, they will become members of NATO. On behalf of my cosponsors and myself, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

The committee's initiative is both timely and appropriate and recognizes the need to provide the most up-to-date available safety equipment to aircraft transporting our military personnel. I would like to clarify a point with the chairman. Mr. Chairman, is the $75 million added by the committee for aircraft passenger safety modifications to be sent on the acquisition of navigation and safety equipment to initiate phase II of the Defense Department's initiative to modify military passenger aircraft? Is it the intent of the committee that this additional funding be spent on the following equipment and technologies: enhanced Ground Proximity warning Systems [EGPWS] with a digital terrain data base, Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance Systems [TCAS], predictive windshear radar, cockpit voice recorders, and flight data recorders?

Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator. I was prepared to offer a floor amendment to this bill, S. 936, to address a very critical program at the Department of Energy site at Hanford. As the chairman is aware, a major and costly cleanup effort is underway at that site as a result of its contributions to the cold war achievements. Part of the cleanup effort will address the highest threat to human health, at the site, the 177 underground storage tanks that not only hold hazardous waste, but high and low levels of radioactive wastes. The Hanford tank waste remediation system project, known as TWRS, is the most critical and costly element in the cleanup of the Hanford site. Those underground tanks contain at-risk nuclear wastes, which have already leaked into the environment. Adequately addressing this situation is absolutely essential, and is in fact codified in the Tri-Party Agreement entered into by the DOE, EPA, and Washington State. Regardless of the method of contracting selected, the time line required in that agreement must be met. 
Currently, DOE is employing an innovative contracting approach to dealing with the remediation of those tank wastes called privatization. DOE embarked on privatization to attract outside financial resources to finance the final design, construction and operation of cleanup projects, which would in turn allow their scarce budget resources to be used to accelerate other cleanup actions. The Department also wanted to take advantage of a commercial approach that has shown in the private sector not only to save dollars, but to reduce the time required to accomplish the task. 
Section 3104 of the bill authorizes $275 million for DOE environmental management privatized projects, including $147 million for TWRS at Hanford. This funding is critical to demonstrate to the privatization contractors the Department's financial commitment to proceed with privatization. Without sufficient funds being reserved, the privatization contractors--which plan to put up their capital to develop the cleanup project--and the contractors' investors have little assurance that TWRS or other privatization contracts will be fully funded. 
While I am concerned that the committee's authorization is not high enough to preclude some out-year BA spikes for the privatization program, I will forgo offering an amendment to increase this year's funding with the understanding that the committee recognizes the need to provide at a minimum $147 million in budget authorization for TWRS to send the correct signal to the contractors and financial community. 
Do I have the assurance of the Senator that he will stand fast on the Senate position of $147 million 
for TWRS in the upcoming conference with the House?

Mr. GORTON. Finally, section 3131, particularly subsection (b), suggests that the authorization amount for privatization projects as defined in section 3104 cannot be used for new contractual obligations until DOE provides a report setting forth a number of basic cost, construction, and savings related provisions. Yet, in the context of the TWRS project, contracts are already in place with two contractors. Each contract contains two parts: a part A in which the contractors will provide deliverables to support the construction and operation of a TWRS facility, and a part B in which DOE, assuming part A deliverables are acceptable, authorizes the contractor, or contractors, to proceed with the permitting and construction of a waste processing facility. Since two Hanford tank waste remediation systems' contracts have already been awarded, and any followon work for part B would be considered an exercised option, I want to be clear that these provisions in section 3131 do not constitute an abrogation or termination of the current contracts in existence.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for this amendment offered by my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, and me which would increase budget authority for the Department of Energy's Environmental Management Program by $50 million. 
It is absolutely essential that the Senate provide as high a level of funding for the Department's privatization program as possible. Like Senator Murray, I am particularly interested in this program because of the tank waste remediation system [TWRS] privatization program at Hanford. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation houses over 55 million gallons of hazardous nuclear and chemical wastes in 177 underground storage tanks located near the Columbia River. The TWRS program was established to manage, retrieve, treat, and immobilize and dispose of these wastes in a safe and cost effective manner. 
Under the TWRS program, the contractors are responsible for demonstrating the technical and business viability of using privatized facilities to treat and immobilize Hanford tank wastes; define and maintain required levels of nuclear, radiological, and occupational safety; maintain environmental protection and compliance; and reduce costs and remediation time. 
Under the privatization program, a contractor can recover the resources it has invested only through the delivery of acceptable services paid for by the DOE on a fixed-unit-price basis. The underlying intent is to transfer the primary share of the financial, performance and operational responsibility for the treatment effort from the government to the private contractor. 
TWRS and similar privatization efforts if done correctly and with proper oversight will allow for significant cost savings and represent an opportunity to use private-sector means and innovative technologies to accelerate cleanup. Without TWRS privatization, it is unlikely we can meet the long-term cleanup compliance milestones at Hanford. If TWRS privatization is not pursued, the project will need to be funded from the base environmental management account which will necessitate cuts elsewhere in the DOE cleanup program--not only at Hanford but at sites throughout the country. 
In order for the privatization concept to work, enough funds must be provided in budget authority to send the appropriate signal to Wall Street and the investment community that Congress is committed to this project. Funding TWRS at a level as close to the President's budget request is vitally important to the success of this program. Increasing funding for this program by $50 million would bring total funding for privatization to $265 million--the same figure that we appropriated on the Appropriations Committee yesterday. I urge support for this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the House of Representatives and the Senate recently passed tax relief plans that will help every American at every stage of life. They are obviously not the solution to all of our problems, but they are a first step in the right direction. 
These carefully crafted tax relief packages will not only make an immediate difference in the monthly budgets of middle-class families but will also encourage the risk taking that will raise the future standard of living for us, for our children, and for our grandchildren. They will accomplish both goals by giving tax credits to people who pay taxes and who bear the cost of raising the next generation and by reducing taxes on saving and investing. 
Why do we need tax relief now? Consider the following: total taxes, Federal, State, and local combined, take up almost one-third of the U.S. economy. That means that for every 8 hours of work the average taxpayer spends almost 3 hours of work to pay the tax collector rather than bringing it home to meet family needs. 
Following our lead, President Clinton has offered a tax relief plan of his own. We congratulate him on continuing to move in our direction, agreeing to tax credits not just for young kids but for teenagers, too, and also for giving families some relief from the death tax. But our plan and the President's still have some big differences. Most importantly, we strongly believe that his plan sells the middle class short. We think he has a much too narrow definition of middle class, one that includes as rich too many families that most people would see as solidly middle class. 
In particular, we think the President's plan has a strange bias against families with working moms. He is much too quick to put families with working mothers in the rich category just because they need two incomes to make ends meet, to pay their taxes, and to stay on top of their bills. 
For example, let us say dad's a teacher and makes $40,000. Everyone knows he is not rich. Now let us say mom's also working and she makes $30,000, money that goes to help raise their three kids, pay their taxes, and save for retirement. Almost everyone would still say this family is not rich. But the President is well out of the mainstream on this issue. His plan says that because mom works, this family is no longer middle class; that it somehow became rich and does not deserve full tax credits for its kids. 
We strongly disagree. Our plans, which got the support of two-thirds of Senate Democrats as well as Republicans, do not punish families with working moms. These families work hard, play by the rules, and struggle to make ends meet. They are overtaxed and they deserve tax relief. If the President will not let them get a full share of lower taxes, if he thinks they only deserve a portion of the tax cuts others will get, then he ought to get out of the tax-cutting business. People who pay 
full-time taxes should not get part-time tax relief. Our tax plans live by this code. They would give this family up to $1,100 more than the President's plan would. 
Is this situation unusual? Definitely not. In 1995, the typical married couple with two or more kids in which both parents worked full time earned almost $61,000. This typical family should be making about $70,000 next year, assuming economic growth keeps going. Remarkably, this income level already disqualifies them for two-thirds of the President's tax credits for children, and that is just for being the typical family with two or more kids and two hard-working parents. 
This crucial point warrants repeating. Under the President's plan, the typical married couple with two or more kids and both parents working full time would not qualify for full tax credits. Why? Because the President thinks they are rich. 
The ultimate shape of this long-sought balanced budget agreement and tax relief package is targeted to be finalized before the August recess. I hope that we can take our case to the American public and sway the White House with the merits of our argument. Families where both parents work to make ends meet hardly fit anyone's definition of rich. More accurately, these families are representative of the effort it takes to keep a roof over their heads, food on the table and the bills paid, especially the hefty bill they are obligated to pay to Uncle Sam. On this key issue, the President clearly is in the wrong. These families are not rich. They are middle class and they deserve a full share of tax relief. 
Under the bipartisan congressional plans, that is exactly what they will get. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the entire legitimacy of this body and the House of Representatives, of the Presidency and of the administration, depends upon its members, in the case of the Presidency the President himself, having been freely chosen by the American people in an election campaign conducted under certain rules consistent with the statutes and the Constitution of the United States. It is a set of serious allegations about violations of those existing rules that is at the heart of the investigation now being conducted by the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
There are many who say the rules ought to be changed, and there can be legitimate debate over how much and in what 
direction those election campaign rules ought to be changed. The issue here and now, however, arises under the current rules, arises under serious allegations about violations of those current rules: The Hatch Act, the misuse of the White House, the use of covert foreign contributions to affect the outcome of the elections, money laundering, and a number of other violations of what the laws relating to the election of the President of the United States are right now. In this connection we have the unfortunate spectacle that many--most of the key witnesses, of those who know the facts, of those who participated in the alleged violations, have either hidden themselves overseas beyond the reach of any subpoena or have stated that they will exercise their fifth amendment rights and will refuse to testify unless they are immunized against the very offenses which so clouded last year's Presidential election. In that connection, we have the regrettable response, a response almost without precedent, on the part of one of the parties, that finding these witnesses is a Republican problem, that grants of immunity to minor participants will not be approved. How markedly, how strikingly this contrasts with the investigation of Watergate, with Iran-Contra, in which the party whose actions were being investigated cooperated fully in attempting to determine the truth of these allegations. 
As we all recognize the vital importance of free and open and fair elections conducted in accordance with the rules, so, it seems to me, we must all recognize the importance of determining whether or not there were serious violations of those existing laws, because if we cannot enforce the law as it exists today, what point is there in debating whether or not we ought to change and tighten those laws? We need the investigations that are being conducted, both here in the Senate of the United States and in the House of Representatives today, to cast light on what actually took place during the course of last year. 
We asked for a special prosecutor. We needed the Department of Justice in order to determine whether or not there were criminal violations that should be prosecuted in the criminal courts of the United States. But the classic justification, the rationale for this Senate investigation is the determination of facts: The breadth and extent of the violations of law that took place last year, who the violators were, what consequences the committee of the Senate feels should stem from those violations, and then and only then whether or not there should be additional laws applicable to the next set of elections. This inquiry and this investigation is of vital importance to the American people. The American people deserve to know precisely what took place during the course of the 1996 Presidential election campaign, on both sides; the breadth and the extent of violations of law, who violated the law, and who knew about and benefited from those violations. 
I call on all of the Members of the Senate to cooperate to the fullest possible extent in the determination of those facts and express my hope that the results of this investigation will be enlightenment and far better practices in the future.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, a few years ago, when the battleship Missouri was decommissioned for the second time, after more than 30 years, the Navy began a process to determine where it could become a permanent historic monument. The Navy carried on that process over an extended period of time under the rules that had been applicable to all previous donations. 
Two weeks before it made its final decision, the Navy informed the applicants of two additional and quite separate considerations. It did not tell any of the applicants the weight those considerations would be given. It did not inform them of the fact that they could submit additional items. They were really quite separate from the first set of considerations. At the end of that first round, Bremerton and Honolulu were essentially tied. At end of the second and unfair round, the Navy awarded the Missouri to Honolulu. 
The General Accounting Office--our General Accounting Office--has reported these changes, has reported that this was the wrong thing to do, and has reported that the Navy should change its processes in the future. 
My amendment does not seek to change the location of the Missouri. It just asks the Navy to start the process over again, to treat all applicants fairly, to set the rules in advance, and not to change the rules just before the game is over without telling people what the weight of the new rules will be. 
I ask for your votes on it as a matter of simple fairness to all of the applicants--both in California and Washington and in Hawaii--in a process which is very important to each one of these communities and which the Navy, very regrettably, has carried on in a totally unfair fashion to this point.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship on which the Japanese surrender was signed in 1945, was decommissioned, mothballed and home ported in Bremerton, WA, from 1954 until it was recommissioned in 1986. It was during that period of time, of course, a major and treasured tourist attraction located relatively conveniently in the continental United States. 
In 1995, the Missouri was decommissioned for a second time and returned to Bremerton. The U.S. Navy then made the Missouri available for donation to a community willing and able to transform the ship into a world class maritime museum honoring the men and women who served in World War II. 
The Save the Missouri Committee in Bremerton competed with four other applicants in Hawaii and California under the same rules that had been applied to all previous Navy donations. 
I want to emphasize that once again, Mr. President. These were general Navy donation rules under which Bremerton and the other four cities competed. 
At the last minute, however, when it was likely that Bremerton would be chosen under those rules, the Navy added two new requirements, failing to tell any of the applicants that the two new requirements would count for 75 percent of the ultimate decision and that the earlier rules were only 25 percent. 
The applicants had 2 weeks to respond. None of the applicants, according to the Navy's own evaluation team, responded adequately. Nevertheless, the Navy awarded the Missouri to Honolulu based exclusively on those new requirements. 
The General Accounting Office then reviewed the Navy process. It criticized it on just the grounds that I have outlined. The Navy nevertheless has refused to reopen the process for the four losing applicants, Bremerton and the three in California. 
Mr. President, during this entire process, I never interfered and told the Navy what answer it should come up with. I simply assumed that the Navy would do so on an objective and on a nonpolitical basis. 
Now, however, I must say that, based on my own experience and the report of the General Accounting Office, I am outraged at the Navy's lack of objectivity and its indifference to fairness. 
This amendment, therefore, sponsored by myself, my colleague from Washington, and Senator Feinstein from California, will not decide the question in favor of one of our cities. It simply requires the Navy to reopen the question and to treat all five applicants fairly and under the same rules that were imposed at the beginning of the process rather than being added at the end. It is as simple as that. Mr. President, something that the Navy should have done in the first place it would be required to do by this amendment. 
Obviously, the location of the Missouri, given its historic nature, is a matter of significance to all of the applicants and, I think, to all Americans and most especially to those who served in World War II. 
Obviously, I would prefer the ultimate location to be in my own State. But I have not demanded in the past, nor do I demand now, that the Navy decide in my favor. I simply ask that it make this decision objectively--nothing more and nothing less. 
For that reason, I ask for the support of my colleagues for this modest proposal.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, with almost all of the factual statements about how the selection process was made, I agree with my friend and colleague from Hawaii. With his unwarranted characterization of Bremerton and, by implication, of San Francisco and of the California applicants, I most decidedly do not. 
Pearl Harbor is in fact a memorial to World War II and to its beginning. But Pearl Harbor, no more than Bremerton or San Francisco, was the location of the surrender of the Japanese on board the Missouri at the end of the war. 
Under the logic of the Senator from Hawaii, the Missouri should be sent to Tokyo Bay and be a memorial and a reminder there. Obviously, that is not going to be the case. But from the point of view of its availability to primarily American tourists, it is obviously more conveniently located in one of the west coast ports than it is Honolulu. 
But, Madam President, the true difference between the Senator from Hawaii and myself is not that. The Senator from Hawaii, as apparently he did to the Navy himself, is making the case for his location. 
I simply depended on the Navy to make that decision objectively. 
The Navy, of course, can set up whatever criteria it wishes for making a donation of a ship or any other artifact to a community, but the Navy, like every other American institution, should do so fairly and on the basis of rules that are not changed at the beginning of the game without telling the participants in the game what the new rules mean or what weight they will be given. Had the Navy followed its original rules, the rules it applied itself to all previous donations, Bremerton was the most likely winner by reason of the deep concern on the part of the community for what had been a part of its history for more than 40 years. But at the very end, the Navy comes up with two other criteria, informs no one of their importance, gives them 75 percent of the weight in making its decision, and comes out, I presume, where someone in the Navy wanted to come out in the first place but could not without changing those rules. 
My amendment does not even require that those rules be changed, though I think they should be, Madam President. It simply requires the Navy to treat the citizens of the five communities that applied to be the permanent home of the Missouri on the basis of the same rules at the end of the process that it had at the beginning of the process and to inform those communities of what the rules are and what their relative weight is. That is asking for the most minimal fairness, Madam President, the most minimal fairness in the world. 
The General Accounting Office did not take a position one way or the other on whether or not the process should be reopened, said that none of the communities were adequately informed about the nature and the weight of the new criteria. That is the fundamental answer that should have caused the Navy to reopen this process on its own. 
Madam President, it is interesting to note that the fairness of this request, the request I am making in this amendment, is recognized even by the Honolulu Advertiser. Now, the Honolulu newspaper, a month ago tomorrow, wrote an editorial on the subject which, of course, takes Senator Inouye's position on the merits, that Pearl Harbor is practically the only logical place and certainly the most logical place for the location of the Missouri. But it does say, in part, 
Officials from Bremerton, WA, cite a General Accounting Office report that says there were a number of last minute changes in the Navy's selection process that skewed it in favor of Honolulu. They want the selection process reopened. Hawaii Senator Dan Inouye, whose enthusiasm was very obvious in the effort to get the Missouri at Pearl Harbor, says the GAO report in itself is skewed. He promises the great battleship will come to Pearl. Let's hope so. But if the proposed Pearl Harbor resting place makes so much sense, as we believe, then there should be no problem in reopening the selection process so that all questions are answered. 
It concludes, `And no one can claim Hawaii stole it. We can proudly say we earned the right to host the Missouri.' 
I am not sure that would be the result. I hope that would not be the result. The very newspaper in Honolulu itself acknowledges that this competition should be a fair one and carries the implication that it was an unfair one. We ask no more than that. This is not a tremendously complicated process. It will not take a long time to do justice. But justice has not been done, Madam President, and it can only be done by the acceptance of this amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment refines legislation enacted last year to transition the uniformed services treatment facilities [USTF's] into the DOD's new health care program called TRICARE. 
I hope that the managers of the bill, Senator Thurmond, chairman of the committee, and Senator Kempthorne, chairman of the operative subcommittee, will accept it. 
Mr. President, I am proud to have been associated with the USTF's since the program's inception over 15 years ago. I was an original cosponsor of the amendment offered on this floor in 1981 by the late Senator Henry M. `Scoop' Jackson that transitioned these former public health service hospitals and clinics to facilities of the uniformed services to provide health care to dependents of active duty personnel as well as military retirees and their dependents. Most recently last summer on this floor, I sponsored the amendment that provided the future authority for the USTF's to continue providing care to military beneficiaries through the integration of their facilities into DOD's military health care delivery system. 
The USTF's currently serve about 120,000 beneficiaries at facilities located in seven States: Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. The facilities provide high-quality care that has been judged by every major study done to date as cost-effective when compared to CHAMPUS and other DOD health care alternatives. The USTF's pioneered managed care principles such as enrollment and capitation that have become the hallmarks of the new TRICARE program. 
The USTF's are very popular with the beneficiaries, many of whom would never consider receiving their health care from any other provider. Satisfaction surveys just completed by an independent firm conclude that the USTF's as a whole have a 91 percent satisfaction rate, 7 percentage points higher than the norm for civilian HMO's. The USTF in my State, Pacific Medical Center, enjoys the highest overall satisfaction rate of nearly 95 percent. I doubt that any DOD health care provider program can match the USTF's for satisfying the medical needs of military personnel and their families. 
The introduction of TRICARE, however, has brought the USTF program to a crossroads. TRICARE has been operating in my State of Washington for over 2 years and started in Texas in November 1995. Its introduction has heightened interest within DOD to integrate the USTF's into TRICARE to ensure consistent application of the so-called uniform benefit. The amendment I offered last year which was enacted as part of the fiscal year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act set out the process for this integration of the USTF's into TRICARE to protect the beneficiary interests as well as to preserve the separate designated status of the USTF's. My amendment, which reflected the position passed by the House, called for an orderly process for negotiation of new agreements so Pacific Medical Center and the other USTF's could continue offering high-quality and cost-effective health care to military beneficiaries. 
Despite my earlier amendment's good intentions, unforeseen problems have developed, largely because of institutional delays and the Defense Department's unconventional interpretation of some of the key provisions. Accordingly, I feel compelled to offer an amendment today that updates and perfects last year's language.  
In a similar fashion to last year, my amendment today includes four straight-forward provisions already contained in the House-passed fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. It is important to note that these four provisions are in every way substantively identical to subtitle C of title VII of the House-passed bill. 
The first House-passed provision provides authority for a 6-month transition period in the implementation of the new USTF program to allow adequate time to educate the beneficiaries. The 6-month transition is entirely reasonable given that new TRICARE contracts provide at least 7 months for a proper transition. As we learned from the TRICARE transition in Washington, a compressed time period for transition will cause confusion and frustration for the beneficiaries. 
The second House-passed provision provides authority to continue the existing USTF agreements during the transition period. The Seattle and Texas USTF's technically lose their statutory designation effective October 1 unless they have new agreements executed. But because of delays in commencing the negotiations with DOD, these two USTF's will not have new agreements implemented by October. An extension of the current agreement and all its provisions until the transition period is complete seems fair and appropriate. 
The third House provision clarifies that the ceiling for capitation payments provided to the USTF's takes into account the health status of the enrolled beneficiaries who are under age 65. This reflects last year's clear intent that the actuarial benchmark for developing rates to reimburse the USTF's should be the health status of the actual USTF enrollees, not a national average of military health care patients. 
The fourth and final House provision clarifies last year's provision so that USTF's still qualify to purchase pharmaceuticals under the preferred pricing levels applicable to military health care providers. All parties agree that last year's legislation was not intended to take away the right to continued acquisition of these reduced-cost drugs. 
In addition to these four House-passed provisions, my amendment includes three other items to ensure that DOD negotiates fairly with the USTF's on the new agreements. These provisions would not be necessary if the Defense Department were earnestly negotiating in good faith with Pacific Medical Center and the Houston, TX, USTF. These two facilities are on the firing line because TRICARE is already in their regions and they are therefore required by law to have a new agreement executed by October 1, 1997. DOD, however, has chosen to negotiate first with three other USTF's that will not see TRICARE in their regions until mid-1998 at the earliest and consequently do not face the same immediacy faced by Seattle and Texas. 
The first new provision tries to prod the negotiations with DOD with a requirement for binding arbitration for up to 90 days if DOD and the Washington and Texas USTF's do not reach an agreement with DOD by October 1, 1997. This arbitration amendment encourages both sides to work out their differences without giving extra leverage to either side. Without arbitration, DOD has no incentive to negotiate because it can literally run the clock out and present the Washington and Texas USTF's with a `take-or-leave-it' contract in late September just before the October 1 deadline arrives. 
Binding arbitration is an eminently fair device to break an impasse and push the negotiations to completion by a date certain. The Seattle and Houston USTF's are fully prepared to accept the judgment of an independent arbiter. If DOD wants to avoid arbitration, the Department's Health Affairs Division should commence immediately good-faith negotiations with Seattle and Houston leading toward a fair agreement. 
This was the result the last time Congress threatened to impose arbitration to push DOD and the USTF to an agreement. The conference report language accompanying the fiscal year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act stressed that Congress was prepared to require mandatory arbitration if the managed care model was not negotiated by DOD and the USTF's by a statutory deadline. This threat of arbitration was instrumental in pushing DOD back to the negotiating table. 
The second new provision contained in my amendment clarifies how the USTF's can contract out their physician services. The clarification permits contracting out to primary care physicians provided the USTF's retain all risk and don't exceed their enrollment cap and their historical service area. The provision serves the beneficiary interest by allowing the USTF's to place primary care physicians where they are needed to enhance the convenience and accessibility of care. This change will also level the playing field with the TRICARE contractors that can contract out their primary care services. 
The third and last new provision in my amendment is a conforming change that applies to the uniform benefit, with the accompanying higher enrollment fee and higher cost shares, when the new USTF agreements are fully implemented. This clarification is needed to ensure consistency with the 6-month transition of the arbitration period. 
Finally, Mr. President, I implore DOD to respond favorably to the request of Pacific Medical Center and the other USTF's for open enrollment season so that military retirees can sign up this summer for the USTF program. Since DOD did not permit Pacific Medical Center to conduct an open season last year, if there is no open enrollment this summer the effect will be to deny military retirees a chance to enroll in this program for 2 consecutive years. The result is substantial pent-up demand and frustration by retirees who are simply looking for another choice in meeting their military health care needs. I urge DOD to adhere to the request in a recent Washington State congressional delegation letter to permit an open season, as clearly provided for in the USTF contracts. 
Overall, Mr. President, this set of legislative refinements, as well as providing for an open season, should enable the USTF program to continue to serve the health care needs of its military beneficiaries. I appreciate the committee's understanding and hope it will soon be able to accept this amendment. Of course, I urge the full Senate to pass it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Commerce Committee, as well as with those of the majority and minority leaders. An efficient FAA will be crucial if our country is to maintain its role as the world leader in the aeronautical and aerospace industries. The FAA must have adequate resources to transform itself into an efficient and productive agency. The anticipated work of the Commission should provide the Congress with valuable guidance in that respect. The proposed changes to the aviation excise taxes in the reconciliation bill should not be a signal to the commission that its ongoing work is meaningless. I intend to work with the leadership of the Commerce Committee and Senate to ensure that the future recommendations of the Commission are not prejudiced by any actions taken in this reconciliation bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, meet Bill and Vivian Loomis from Lind, WA. The Loomises farm, in eastern Washington, wheat and potatoes. The Loomises, under the present tax law, have been dunned by the Bureau of Internal Revenue to pay an alternative minimum tax on income they have not even received. 
That is to say, they are supposed to pay, this year, taxes that will not accrue until next year because the income will not come in until next year. 
Now, they have had to spend $20,000 of their hard-earned money in fighting the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the IRS, on that subject. We have, in a bipartisan manner, gotten the IRS to lay off of many other farmers who are in the same position. 
This bill, this Republican bill, this bill reported almost unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee, takes care of that situation. It rights that wrong. It says to Bill and Vivian Loomis, `You don't have to pay taxes until you've received your income.' Simple justice, Mr. President. 
But what else does the Republican proposal before the Senate do for people like Bill and Vivian Loomis who have worked hard all their lives as farmers in eastern Washington? Mr. President, it says to them, when they pass away, their farm will not be taken away by the Internal Revenue Service with a punitive and overwhelming death tax. It gives them a bit of a break in their ability to pass that on to their children and grandchildren. 
Now, Mr. President, Bill and Vivian Loomis have 7 children and 11 grandchildren. Their children are too old to give them the tax credit that is included in the Republican proposal. But their sons and daughters who are raising kids, who are struggling on limited incomes that they are earning and paying taxes on will get a $500 break for each of those 11 grandchildren of the Loomises' who are under the age of 17 years old. Real people, real benefits. And when those grandchildren are ready to go to college or university, there will be tax credits to help pay for that tuition. 
Mr. President, we are talking here, today, about real people who work hard, who earn an income, and who pay taxes on that income. Our Taxpayer Relief Act is to provide relief for those taxpayers. It is not designed to add to the welfare system. It is designed to provide relief for real taxpayers. It is designed to say that the Loomises, should they decide to sell their farm, will not pay an overwhelming and punitive capital gains tax; that if they have managed to save and invest in some stocks, they can sell them to go into a better investment without an overwhelming and punitive capital gains tax. 
Mr. President, the best single line I can give is, 75-75--75 percent of the benefits of this Taxpayers Relief Act go to families with incomes of $75,000 and less per year, who are actually paying taxes today. That is what this is all about. 
We really hear a great deal from the other side, a side that really was not at all happy about reducing taxes on hard-working Americans at all. I am delighted they have an alternative that at least provides some tax relief. But until we came along we heard about nothing other than tax hikes, not tax reductions. 
My constituents, Mr. President, in the State of Washington, pay the fifth highest income taxes per person in the United States of America--almost $7,000 a year. They will get almost 2 billion dollars' worth of real tax relief, to real taxpayers, out of this bill. The benefits of our bill as against the other that attempts to target everything, that attempts to adjust society again through the Tax Code, our tax relief will go to real people, real people, like Bill and Vivian Loomis, who have worked hard all their lives, who have put something away, who want to help their children and grandchildren, who want to help build their country and who want to pass something of what they have done on to their children. 
It is much the superior proposal. It does not depend on gimmicks, like saying that the rental value of the house they own and live in is part of your income--as if you could live on the street and rent your house out. It is based on providing real tax relief to real working people who are overtaxed in the United States today, who have worked hard and deserve to keep what they have earned, like Bill and Vivian Loomis.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last weekend, I had the opportunity to spend time along the banks of the Columbia River in the town of Mattawa, WA. I held a field hearing there to explore various proposals to preserve a stretch of the Columbia River's pristine beauty, and to ensure that one of our State's great natural assets remains protected. 
The community of Mattawa opened its doors to me, to my staff, and to all of those who testified at and attended the public hearing, which attracted nearly 1,000 people. I want to thank the people of the community who so generously welcomed us, and worked so diligently to ensure that our hearing was a success. Without their attention to detail and enthusiasm, such civil discourse in so comfortable a setting would not have been possible. We could not have asked for finer hosts. 
Our public hearing was held at the Saddle Mountain Intermediate School, in Mattawa. I would especially like to thank Dr. Bill Miller, superintendent of the Wahluke School District for all of his efforts on our behalf. Also, I would like to thank all of those in law enforcement, the school staff, and the volunteers who made our hearing such a success: 
Mattawa Mayor Judy Essor; Ms. Luz Juarez-Stump, Saddle Mountain Intermediate School principal; Ms. Karen Hilliker, Saddle Mountain Intermediate School secretary; Mr. Mike Holland, Middle School principal; Mary Jane Holland, Wahluke School District staff; Mr. Steven Buckingham, teacher and advisor for the class of 1998; Ms. Lark Moore, Ms. Polly Weeks and Ms. Marlene Bird, staff for the Wahluke School District; Students from the Wahluke High School class of 1998, who provided us with wonderful refreshments; Andrea Eckenbuerg, chairwoman of the parent volunteers; Mr. Scott Egan, technical director for the school; Mr. Tim Schrag, maintenance supervisor; Chief of Policy Randy Blackburn and Chief Criminal Deputy Bryan Pratt who coordinated security for us. 
These individuals made our visit comfortable and enjoyable, and I hope some day soon to be able to return to this beautiful, friendly part of our State. 
Thank you all.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the Majority Leader's efforts to work with me on this important legislation. I also want to thank him for his efforts to address the concerns of all the interested parties involved in the ocean shipping industry. I identified three areas in the bill we passed in Committee that were of particular concern to me and that I wanted addressed before the bill was taken to the full Senate. The Leader has 
worked diligently to address my concerns. I too believe this reform is desperately needed. I am pleased that the committee took the extra time after the markup to complete the work on this bill. An agreement was reached that the majority of America's shipping stakeholders can accept: the ports, longshore labor, shippers, and carriers.

But I believe it is a significant improvement over the status quo.

Mr. GORTON. Let me take a moment to briefly review my concerns. First, I requested that certain discrimination prohibitions concerning service contracts be applied to carriers only when they are working together, not when they are operating as individual companies. 
Second, I sought to amend the forest products definition to incorporate certain products, such as laminated beams or panels. 
And third, I wanted shippers and carriers to be able to keep confidential the essential terms of their service contracts. Since the markup, there has been a sincere effort by all parties to work with me. 
Mr. President, throughout this consensus building process, the Committee was dedicated to working through my concerns, and I believe that the Majority Leader did his best. 
Common ground was found on the first two of my concerns. I appreciate the modification of the service contract discrimination provisions so that they apply only to carriers when they work collectively. This modification is particularly important to me 
and to my shippers in Washington state. 
I also appreciate that the definition of forest products was modified as I requested. 
Regrettably, we were unable to reach an agreement on the confidentiality for service contracts. We explored the idea of not requiring carriers to publish information regarding volume, but this, unfortunately, was rejected. 
Mr. President, I would like to reserve the right to address the confidentiality issue in an amendment when the full Senate considers this bill.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the thrust of this amendment is to encourage the inclusion of the three Baltic Republics, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the earliest practicable date. It is similar to the proposal already made by the Senator from Illinois, which is directed more at the time of preparation; this one, with that ultimate goal. 
I think that, in the most profound sense, this is not a highly controversial matter. The President has stated that the goal of the United States in the present round is to admit three highly qualified nations, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, to NATO. I want simply to say at this point that I enthusiastically support that policy on the part of the President and will certainly vote to ratify any treaty to that effect. 
I share some of the disappointment of the Senator from Delaware, with whom I previously discussed this subject in private, that the first round is not more expansive than it seems likely to be. I tend to fall on the side of those European allies of ours who would admit Slovenia at the very least and perhaps Romania as well. Nevertheless, any step forward in bringing thoroughly into the fold of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and therefore into first class membership in the basically Western European and North Atlantic community is a consummation that is devoutly to be sought by all of us. 
My particular amendment, and that of the Senator from Illinois, is focused on three nations collectively, not as large in population as the smallest of the three nations that are about to be admitted to NATO. 
The three Baltic nations have a unique role in European history, in some respects a uniquely tragic role in that each of them in modern times stood as an independent nation only for roughly 20 years. Between the end of World War II, 1939, 1940, they lost their independence until each of them regained that independence in the early 1990's. 
They are unique as well, madam President, in the sense that it is greatly to the credit of the United States of America that this Nation almost alone of all of the nations of the world never formally recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union. For the better part of half a century, there were tiny embassies here in Washington, DC, representing what seemed, I suspect, to most the vain hope that at some distant future day those nations would once again meet their own aspirations and become independent. 
I always agreed with this policy. It was policy that was followed by President Franklin Roosevelt, by President Truman, by President Eisenhower, by President Kennedy, by President Johnson, by President Nixon, by President Ford, by President Carter, by President Reagan, into the administration of President Bush, at which point that independence and freedom became a reality. 
I had the great honor, Madam President, a number of years ago of having been invited to address the Congress of Estonia, the first, and illegal under Soviet law, calling together a group of people in Estonia to begin that process of independence. It is a mark of the opposition in the then Soviet Union to that independence that I was not granted a visa and was unable to make that speech in Tallinn. I made the speech, however, from the floor of this United States Senate, Madam President, and sent the videotape to Estonia. As I was told afterward, it made a greater splash, greater showing than if I had actually been able to be there in person. 
So I have this particularly close feeling for the people of Estonia and for its independence. It was several years later that I was first able to visit that country. But I know what each of these other Senators on the floor knows, that the people of those tiny nations regard themselves as integral parts of our Western European North Atlantic civilization. 
Their foreign policy can be summed up in a desire to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Yes, a major part of this is a feeling that their physical security will be enhanced by being a part of NATO. And, yes, in some sense it will be. But I believe more than that, the psychological value felt by the people of those nations, freed after almost half a century of being occupied, frozen in place by a Soviet dictatorship, is equal to whatever the formal security arrangements will be. 
I believe that nothing could be more in the tradition of the United States of America, that from 1940 until early in the 1990's never recognized that these nations had lost their independence, than to invite these three small nations as quickly as possible to be a part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Obviously, they are not on this list for the first round. If in fact a second round is limited to, say, Slovenia and Romania, they will not be a part of the second round either. I do believe, however, Madam President, that it is important for us here in the U.S. Senate to recognize that these aspirations take place because of the tremendous admiration the people of those countries have for the United States and for all we have 
stood for during their long decades of darkness. 
So I hope, and I hope fervently, that in the course of the next 24 hours the group of Senators here on the floor can reach an accommodation pursuant to which that aspiration on the part of the people of these three small nations will be recognized in this bill by the time that we have passed this bill. The House of Representatives has already done so in slightly different language than my amendment or the amendment from the Senator from Illinois. 
One of my suggestions might be that we try to create parallel language so that each of the Houses of Congress has passed exactly the same thought. 
I am, however, quite flexible on how we go about granting this degree of recognition and support. But I do think that for the future of democracy, for the future of small countries who so long aspired to be free, and now with our help are free, that this recognition should be granted.

Mr. GORTON. This amendment, Mr. President, merges together two amendments related to NATO enlargement offered earlier by Senator Durbin in the case of amendment No. 378, and myself and others in connection with amendment No. 379. 
I understand, through the graciousness and thoughtfulness of the senior Senator from North Carolina and Senator Biden from Delaware, that this amendment has now been agreed to. It does express United States support for working toward the qualification of five nations for NATO--the three Baltic States, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, together with Romania and Bulgaria. The latter was suggested by Senator Biden and expresses the view of the Senate that when each of those nations has become qualified for that membership, that that membership ought to be granted. 
I spoke earlier about my strong feelings, strong feelings with which I know Senator Durbin particularly concurs, in favor of the Baltics after their long struggle through half a century of darkness to their independence and their growing democracies. 
Romania, of course, has been suggested by a number of European countries for membership at the current time. It has had dramatic changes toward democracy and responsibility in recent years. Bulgaria, just in the last few months, now seems to be moving in that direction. 
We all feel that as they qualify, they ought to be welcomed into this united group of Western European and North Atlantic nations into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Each of them will contribute to it, each of them will be strengthened by it, not just from the point of view of their physical security, but I might put it their moral security as well, their desire to be a part of the world from which they were excluded for so long by the Soviet Union. 
This amendment is identical, with one exception, to an amendment already passed in the House of Representatives. The wording is precisely the same. Bulgaria, at the suggestion of Senator Biden, has been added. 
With that, Mr. President, I think I speak for each of the sponsors and I thank Senator Helms for his understanding and support.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is no secret to my colleagues that perhaps the greatest contributor to our Nation's economic success is the hard work, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit of America's small businessowners. It is, therefore, appropriate that the U.S. Small Business Administration has honored Washington State businessman, Mr. David Giuliani, as the National Small Business Person of the Year. Mr. Giuliani is president and chief executive officer of the Bellevue, WA, based Optiva Corp. which manufactures the Sonicare brand of toothbrushes. Starting Optiva as a technology transfer project from the University of Washington in 1988, Mr. Giuliani has overseen the company's progression from a startup business to an employer of 250 with sales of over $50 million in 1995. With growth of this kind it is not surprising that, last October, Inc. Magazine recognized Optiva as the second-fastest growing private company in the entire nation. To celebrate its success at the production of its millionth toothbrush last year, Mr. Giuliani's company gave away more than 1,000 Sonicare toothbrushes to individuals who couldn't afford them on their own. 
 Mr. President, I am proud to represent a State that is home to such an outstanding businessman and citizen. Mr. Giuliani certainly deserves the title of Small Business Person of the Year.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I would like to speak briefly about the amendment I have introduced to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This bill, in my estimation goes a long way toward giving Americans more flexibility in how they fulfill their responsibilities to work and their families. S. 4 provides working Americans an option which is already available to public sector employees, the ability to choose compensatory time off in lieu of cash overtime pay. Further, the bill assures private sector employees that their choice to take either compensatory time or overtime pay will be protected. The use of coercion, intimidation, or harassment to force a private sector employee to take either compensatory time or overtime pay as a condition of employment is expressly prohibited under this bill. My amendment simply extends those same assurances to public safety officers. 
In my State of Washington, Jim Mattheis, president of the Washington State Council of Police and Sheriffs, reports that compensatory time is extremely popular with the families of working law enforcement. Access to compensatory time has increased the morale, efficiency, and safety of law enforcement officers. More importantly, compensatory time provides law enforcement families some much needed flexibility in work schedules which are exceptionally stressful. 
Unfortunately, my law enforcement constituents in Washington State report that the experience in the public sector has demonstrated a need to ensure that employees are free to choose whether to work for overtime pay, to use their compensatory time within a reasonable amount of time once it is earned, or to preserve their comptime banks. 
Police officers provide a tremendous service to our communities. They put their lives on the line each day to protect our families and our communities. Public safety officers deserve to have the simple assurance that their choice of compensatory time or cash overtime pay is preserved.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the budget resolution which has just been adopted by this body is a remarkable achievement. It is a remarkable achievement partly because, for the first time in decades, it was adopted by a large bipartisan majority rather than as a simple partisan document. It is a remarkable achievement as well, I believe, because each of the 78 Members of this body who voted for it did so with serious reservations about substantial portions of that budget resolution. Yes, it meets the primary objective of the President and of the vast majority of Members in Congress in that it establishes policies under which the budget will, in fact, come into balance shortly after the turn of the century. 
Yes, it does, in fact, limit spending and the growth of Government to a slower rate at least than would take place were we on automatic pilot. 
Yes, it meets some but by no means all of the President's priorities as he outlined them in his State of the Union Address. 
And, yes, it provides very real tax relief for the American people, most particularly for working American parents and their children. But those of us for whom tax relief was a major goal are unhappy because it is insufficient and because there are too many new spending programs, and those relatively indifferent to tax relief but in favor of all of the President's priorities, and more, are unhappy because there is not enough spending included in this resolution. 
In the long run, however, Mr. President, I believe that it represents a triumph, or rather the culmination of a set of conflicting ideas which somehow or another have joined together to make a real success. 
In 1993, along with every one of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I opposed President Clinton's first budget in the firm belief that it would result in harm to our economy. Now, in a very real sense, we were wrong. For a group of reasons, the budget deficit did, indeed, decline and economic opportunity did, indeed, increase. 
In 1995, as a part of a majority, we proposed a dramatic change in direction, a real balanced budget for the first time, genuine tax relief for the first time and major reforms in entitlement programs designed not only to help the taxpayers' pocket, but to save the future of Medicaid and of Medicare. 
That resolution never became law because of the President's veto, but it did have one tremendously positive impact. For the first time, the President and a majority of his party dedicated themselves actually to balancing the budget. During the entire year during which that 1995 budget was debated, interest rates declined, it became easier and easier for the people of the United States to purchase homes, purchase automobiles, start new businesses, provide job opportunities. Only when the promise began to fail did interest rates, once again, increase. 
The promise was renewed early this year, and a few short weeks ago met fruition in an agreement between the Republican leadership of both Houses and the President of the United States. 
Since even the commitment to a balanced budget paid dramatic dividends in increased economic opportunity, lower unemployment and lower interest rates, the accomplishment of a balanced budget, I am convinced, Mr. President, will bring even more rewards to the American people in lower interest rates and greater opportunity, 
and for the first time in decades meeting our responsibility not to spend money today while sending the bills to our children and to our grandchildren. 
I am convinced, in spite of my own disagreement with some of the policies in this proposal, that it will have nothing but good results with respect to the economy of the United States. Yet, Mr. President, I am convinced there are still very real troubles ahead, very real rough spots in the road. 
I note that while only eight Members of the Democratic Party voted against the budget resolution, the vast majority of them voted for amendment after amendment during the course of the last 3 days that would have increased taxes and increased spending, by my own total for the amendments, by $88 billion in higher taxes and almost that amount in greater spending--direct violations of the agreement that they and the President have made with the Republican leadership. 
As a consequence, I am convinced that it is important for all of us on both sides of the aisle to remember that we made a commitment to the American people in this agreement, one that was almost instantly approved by the vast majority of our citizens, and keep not just those parts of the agreement with which we agree, but those with which we disagree. 
I am the chairman, Mr. President, of a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. The agreement includes a number of Presidential priorities that can only be funded through my subcommittee. Several of those priorities are ones with which I disagree. I think the money could be spent elsewhere better. But I do feel committed to keep those unpleasant parts of the agreement in order to reach the overall more important goals that are a part of a historic budget resolution. 
So, in one sense, Mr. President, the vote a few hours ago was the culmination of a process and of a debate which has lasted for many, many years. In another sense, it is only the beginning. And unless it is taken seriously by those who support it, we still face the prospect of failing. 
I am an optimist. I think that this is a new beginning, more than an ending to a long period of arid political exchanges. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in order to make it happen.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lie on the northwestern border of Russia. These three tiny Baltic nations have historically served as a crossroads as bargaining chips between great powers. As a result, they have been invaded and dominated by foreign countries throughout their history. The Baltics were occupied and oppressed by the Soviet Union during all of the cold war, but are now on a quick path to full democracy and free market economies. 
As we meet in Madrid this July with our NATO partners to discuss expansion of the alliance, we should also consider extending an invitation to our friends in the Baltics. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have all made significant progress toward the NATO requirements of irreversible democracy, free market economies, and civilian-controlled militaries. They have participated in NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative by supplying troops to NATO peacekeeping efforts. The Baltic nations have requested, and deserve, consideration for full NATO membership. That is why I am introducing legislation today recommending the integration of Estonia, Lativa, and Lithuania into NATO at the earliest possible date. 
Having traveled to Estonia recently, I have a very personal interest in its entry into NATO. Estonia is a beautiful nation on the Baltic Sea, inhabited by brave men and women dedicated to democracy and freedom from foreign domination. The people of Estonia have been under foreign rule throughout almost their entire history. They were ruled by Germans in the 13th century, Swedes in the 16th and 17th centuries, and by Tsarist Russia in the 19th century. Finally, after World War I, Estonia fought for independence for 2 years and won. The people of Estonia established a parliamentary democracy and their republic flourished for nearly two decades until the Soviet Union, and then Nazi Germany invaded during World War II. With the end of Soviet domination, Estonia and their Baltic neighbors look to the West for protection of their right to independence. 
Unfortunately, the subject of NATO expansion to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania has become taboo. Many in the U.S. national security community believe the Baltics, lying so close to Russia and within the area Yaltsin considers to be Russia's sphere of influence, should not be considered for NATO membership. In fact, in February, Russian President Boris Yeltsin stated that Baltic membership in NATO would have an `extremely negative impact' on stability in the region and that the preservation of the Baltic nations' status outside blocs could dispel `still lingering fears for their security.' We should not allow these threatening comments to influence our efforts to expand NATO. 
Out of fear of isolating Russia, the United States and our European allies may forsake three tiny nations that did so much to promote the collapse of the Soviet Union and the eradication of communism throughout Eastern Europe. 
Cold war history is replete with tragedy. The expansion of the Soviet Union across Eastern Europe is one of history's darkest moments. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, all independent nations since 1918, fell victim to secret negotiations between Hitler and Stalin during World War II. Under the auspices of the Molotove-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, the Soviet Union laid claim to the Baltics, invaded, and ruled them with an iron fist from 1945 until 1991. Now it is time for NATO to take decisive action to rectify the past and protect the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from any future foreign irredentism. 
Future NATO membership for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania is essential to their safety and prosperity. Democracy and economic reform and expansion may be at risk to security if the Baltics continue to exist, unprotected, in the shadow of an increasingly nationalistic Russia. The United States must ensure that the Baltic nations are invited to the NATO summit in Madrid and must work toward eventual membership in our security alliance for Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and thank Senators D'Amato and Durbin for joining me as a original cosponsors.

Mr. GORTON. I yield such time on the amendment as I may use. 
Mr. President, my colleague and ally from New Jersey a few moments ago said of the amendment of the Senator from Missouri on this case I could not disagree more. I must say I could not disagree less and still disagree, but disagree I must do. 
The reason I put it in that form is that the Senator from Missouri has presented us with an amendment that is for all practical purposes in statutory form the constitutional amendment on the balanced budget that was supported by almost but not quite two-thirds of the Members of this body. It differs, of course, not just in being in budget resolution language but in being effective immediately rather than several years from now, and in dealing with declining budget deficits as if each of them was the triggering mechanism for the supermajority requirements that are included within it. 
It is, nevertheless, a theory with which this Senator and the manager of the bill, the Senator from New Mexico, agree. The point with which we disagree, however, is the proposition that this philosophy should be added to this budget resolution. The issue is an important one. It is an appropriate one to be debated. 
I can remember personally a decade ago when I had serious enough reservations about a constitutional amendment on the balanced budget when I felt that this philosophy ought to be passed in the form of a statute so that we could determine as a country whether or not it worked before we moved toward placing it in the Constitution. Personally, I would still be willing to do that. 
However, it is important enough, it is vital enough that it ought to be debated independently of a budget resolution, which, as the Senator from New Jersey has said, marks the first time on which we have had a budget resolution in the time that I have been here at least that was supported largely by both sides of the aisle and in this case by the President of the United States. 
And so while it is possible to argue, I suppose, that this amendment does not formally or technically breach the bipartisan agreement on the budget, as did yesterday's amendment on a tobacco tax and several of the other amendments that have been voted on here, it clearly breaches at the very least the spirit of this budget resolution agreement. It also clearly represents a vitally important policy decision which should not be debated for an hour or 2 hours as an amendment to this bill and then added to it. 
It is for that reason, keeping what this Senator believes to be a commitment to pass this budget resolutions essentially in the form in which it was presented to this body, that I regret to say it is not acceptable to the leadership on this side as it is not to the leadership on the other side. 
Now, Mr. President, for the information of other Members of the Senate, when all time has been yielded back on this debate--and I intend to yield our time back in just a moment--the Senator from New Jersey will raise a point of order against this amendment. I believe that the Senator from Missouri will move that the point of order be waived, will ask for a rollcall vote on that subject, and then we will stack that rollcall vote after the one previously ordered. We will go on to a similar but not identical amendment that will be sponsored jointly by the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from 
Oklahoma, and I suspect, although I cannot guarantee this, that when debate on that is completed we will probably have a series of votes, all of the votes that have been stacked at that time, which might very possibly take place at or around 6 o'clock. 
With that, Mr. President, I am prepared to and I do yield back the remainder of my time on this amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours ago, in introducing this resolution, the distinguished minority manager of the bill, the Senator from New Jersey, had behind him a long and detailed chart from which he read all of the initiatives of his party, all of the spending programs of his party, that were a part of this budget resolution and were the justification for Members of his party who favored those spending programs to vote for and to support this resolution. 
Mr. President, some of those proposals were also Republican proposals with which a number of us on this side of the aisle agree. Many of them however were not. Many of them represent Government spending with which we disagree, which we think is wasteful, money that we think ought to be returned to the people of the United States. Nevertheless, we support the budget resolution and those spending programs because this resolution also provides tax relief for the American people and does overall reduce the rate of growth in Government spending. 
As a consequence, Mr. President, this is not a Republican budget resolution here today. This is a resolution the outlines of which were agreed to by the Republican leadership in both Houses, by the Democratic leadership in this body and the President of the United States. We have before us an amendment, however, that totally and completely breaches that set of agreements. It adds $30 billion in taxes on the backs of the American people. It adds $20 billion in spending programs on to the backs of the American people, in spite of the fact that the resolution itself includes $16 billion for health care for young people in our society. 
I have a copy of the amendment, Mr. President. Nothing in the amendment talks about tobacco taxes or child health care. It simply is three pages of increased spending and increased taxes --nothing more and nothing less. 
It is a total breach of the agreement made by the Democratic leadership, a total breach of the agreement made by the President of the United States. And bluntly, Mr. President, those of us on this side of the aisle, who felt constrained to agree to this budget agreement because it was bipartisan, expect the support for the resolution in its original form without increased taxes and without increased spending to be supported as eloquently and as strongly on the other side of the aisle as it is on this side of the aisle.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Hagel's legislation commemorating the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Senate Resolution 87. His resolution is a fitting tribute not only to the wall itself, but to the 58,196 American men and women who gave their lives for this country in Southeast Asia or who are still missing nearly 20 years after the conclusion of the war. 
The memorial, the names of Americans killed and missing engraved in its marble edifice, is an eery reminder of the sacrifice made by so many young men and women for a cause many here at home disputed. Nearly 9 million Americans served in Vietnam. Their valor in war was too often greeted with disrespect upon their return home. That is why the Vietnam Veterans Memorial plays such an important role in honoring the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers who served in an unpopular war at a tumultuous time in American history. 
While the memorial's design was at first controversial, it has become an important aspect of the National Mall in Washington, DC, visited by tens of thousands of tourists every year. For those whose loved ones perished in Vietnam, it is an opportunity to see firsthand, that their friends or relatives will be revered and remembered for a long time to come. For those who were not touched personally by the war, the memorial is a chance to understand and experience Vietnam. And for all Americans, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a lesson about the dangers of war and the bravery, character, and patriotism of the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
On this, the 15th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Senator Hagel's resolution is a timely and appropriate way to honor all those who served in Vietnam. I am proud, Mr. President, to be an original cosponsor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as we are going back and forth, I will take a very few moments and then yield to one of my Democratic colleagues, so I yield such time as I may use. 
Mr. President, the parentage of this successful budget resolution is ardently sought by many. Only failure is an orphan. In this case--I hope not to drive the metaphor too far--I believe that many properly may claim parentage of the resolution that is before us here. 
In the decade and a half during which I have served in the U.S. Senate, this budget resolution marks two firsts. It is the first resolution that genuinely will yield us, when passed and enforced, to a balanced budget, to a situation in which we will no longer be piling debt upon debt on the backs of our children and our grandchildren. It is also, remarkably, the first budget resolution during that period of time that seems likely to pass with significant majorities in favor of it from both political parties. 
As I look back on the history that has led to this point, I reflect on the fact that members of the Democratic Party and the President of the United States can claim some credit in moving in this direction for the highly controversial resolution that they proposed and passed without any support from the Republican Party some 4 years ago. Our predictions that that resolution would have dire consequences did not, in fact, turn out to be the case. We may still believe that a different course of action would have had even better results, but, obviously, at this point we cannot prove that. The Senator from New Jersey has already spoken to that proposition. 
At the same time, 2 years later, when the Republicans became a majority in both the House and in the Senate, we passed and attempted to enforce a budget resolution more dramatic even than the one that is before us today, with its reform of entitlement programs, its securing of Medicare for many, many years to come, and in the tax relief that it provided for the American people. 
Ultimately, the enforcing mechanism for that budget resolution was successfully vetoed by President Clinton, but, nonetheless, it charted a new and different course of action for the American economy and especially for the way in which the Congress and the President determined spending and taxing priorities. 
Before the President vetoed the results of that budget resolution, he had, for the first time, committed himself to balancing the budget. I think, again, many Members of this side discounted that commitment, as we believed that it was not carried out by the policies that he recommended pursuant to his commitment to a balanced budget. But nevertheless, the debate then became not whether to balance the budget but how. That debate, a debate separating the two political parties, continued until just a short few weeks ago. 
At that point, the President, the leaders of the Republican Party in both the House and the Senate, with the assent of much of the Democratic leadership, reached an agreement, not only on the ultimate goal but on the means by which to reach that goal, and it is some of the details of that agreement which, after further negotiation, are a part of the budget resolution that is before us this afternoon. 
The Senator from New Jersey has outlined many of the elements of this budget resolution which he believes meet the agenda of his party and of the President of the United States. Ours on this side may be fewer, but we think they may be more profound. We have reached the goal we have sought without wavering and without compromise: of a resolution that would, in real terms, promise a balance to the Federal budget with lower interest rates, with a fiscal dividend that that would bring with it. And we are now right at the edge of meeting that goal. 
We have succeeded in crafting a budget resolution and getting agreement to a budget resolution which will provide real genuine tax relief for the American people, for American families with children, for farmers and small businessmen, and estate tax relief, for investors and for job creators in the realm of capital gains, and we have also succeeded, at least modestly, in getting agreement to the beginnings of certain reforms in the entitlement programs, which are almost exclusively responsible for spending increases each and every year for decades that outpaced both inflation and the growth of our economy. 
Government will not grow as a result of this resolution at anything like the rapidity it would have grown without it. The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, has, in this illustration, shown what happens with respect to the budget deficit, even including the tax relief that is an integral part of this resolution today. 
So we will have more modest spending than would otherwise 
have been the case. We will have tax relief for the American people. We will have a balanced budget due to the diligence of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico and the broad support he has from his own party, due to the eloquence and hard work of the majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, and the wonderful relationship he and the Senator from New Mexico created for one another, due to the hard work of many members of the Democratic Party and of the President and his advisers, and perhaps not least in all of the credit that should be given here in the parenting of this budget resolution would go to those outsiders led by the Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] and the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux] who last year created a bipartisan budget resolution, with all of the elements that this one has--some to a more dramatic extent than this one has--and came within four votes of carrying that resolution on the floor of this U.S. Senate, even though they were opposed by the leadership in both parties and by the President of the United States. Many of the elements of their proposal are included today, but they blazed the trail for a degree of bipartisan cooperation that had not previously existed. 
So for my part at least, Mr. President, I am delighted to give credit where credit is due and to say that credit is extremely widely spread. I trust that after listening to the debate today and tomorrow--I hope not longer than that--that the resolution that is before us will not have been significantly changed by amendment, that it will be passed by a very substantial bipartisan majority, a majority of both parties, and that it will then be properly carried out and properly enforced by all of those who have supported it, for which the Congress and the President will deserve credit and thanks from the people of the United States, both for their responsibility and for having created the opportunities for greater economic growth and greater prosperity for the people of the United States.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, from the time that I first became involved in national politics, it has seemed to me that, for mature adults, under most circumstances, the law was not an appropriate method of determining what are ultimately moral choices for the people most intimately involved with those choices. I believe that my views probably reflect those of a majority of the American people who believe that this should be a matter of an individual woman's choice and that of close family--under most cases. 
But, Mr. President, when we talk about late-term abortion and when we speak specifically about partial-birth abortion, we are not dealing with most cases. I think it is clear that the majority of the American people, as they have come increasingly to understand exactly what this procedure is, are horrified by it. 
I have been disturbed by the nature of this debate, by the intentional deceit and misinformation about the frequency and necessity of this practice. Only recently, have the opponents of this ban have admitted `lying through their teeth' about the facts on the number of partial-birth abortions performed and grounds for this horrific procedure. 
It is clear, Mr. President that this practice is not necessary. Just last week, the American Medical Association Board of Trustees said there is `no identified situation' that requires the use of this procedure and as of yesterday, endorsed this bill. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state that there are `no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life of the mother'. 
This is a practice that is not compassionate, nor is it within the bounds of civilized or humane behavior. My colleagues have described it in detail, and I don't need to repeat that detail. But I do think that it is significant that those who oppose this bill generally speaking, talk in circumlocution, disguise the language, resist and object not only to a description of the procedure itself, but even to the title-partial-birth abortion. They speak about slippery slopes rather than the procedure itself and attempt to avoid the true brutality and extreme nature of the procedure. 
It is simple, this procedure is brutal, inhumane and clearly unnecessary. This vote will be a defining issue about our own society, about our feelings for indifference to brutality, about violence, about uncivilized, inhumane behavior. For all of those reasons, Mr. President, I am convinced that we should pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, and I deeply hope that a sufficient majority of my colleagues will vote to do that.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment which we are about to vote on is extremely simple, plain, easy to understand and totally logical. 
It reads in its entirety: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each State educational agency or local educational agency may establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and order applicable to all children within its jurisdiction to ensure the safety and appropriate educational atmosphere in its schools. 
Mr. President, I have spoken about the fact that this bill imposes a huge unfunded mandate, $35 billion a year, on the schools of this country with no more than 10 percent of that money paid for by the Federal Government. 
I have spoken of the huge complexity--327 pages in this bill--imposing identical rules on every school district in the country no matter how large or how small. But the single aspect of this bill that is most questionable and most unjust is the double standard it sets with respect to discipline, response to violence, disorder in the classroom. Each and every school district retains its full and complete authority over all of these questions as they apply to students who are not disabled. They lose almost all of that authority under the present IDEA statute and regain only a modest amount of it under this revision. 
This double standard makes it difficult to provide an appropriate education to tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of our students around the country. They make it difficult to impose rational disciplinary measures on those students who are denominated disabled. They create a tremendous incentive to seek some `expert' who will provide for a given student the title `disabled.' We find the decisions that the very disorder, the very violence in classrooms that is to be the subject of discipline is found to be evidence of disability so that the discipline cannot be imposed. 
For the educational attainment of all of our students, for the proper protection of all of our students, we should allow each school, each school district, each State to set rules with respect to disorder, to discipline, to violence that are the same for all of the students. Nothing could be simpler. 
This amendment will not in any way undercut the right created by this bill for a free and complete education for every student, disabled or not. That remains. What is restored to each school district is the right on its own to make those decisions while looking at the educational atmosphere in which all of its students must learn. The vice of this bill is that it pretends that there are no nondisabled students, only the disabled students count, only their rights count. The rights of all other students and their parents are ignored. 
So we ask very simply that this bill be amended to allow each educational agency to establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and order applicable to all children within its jurisdiction in order that they may be safe and have an appropriate educational atmosphere--nothing more, nothing less. 
This bill says that the U.S. Senators know more about how to educate students than do their teachers, their administrators, their school board members, people who have spent their lives and careers at this job. We do not know more. They know more. We should permit them to do their jobs.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in a recent article in the National Review, the author, Chester Finn, Jr., made the following comments about the present statute equally applicable to this bill. 
. . . prescriptive federal mandates that create heavy costs and regulatory burdens for local communities; extra benefits for government-protected populations and their exemption from rules that others must obey; ample opportunities for activists and lawyers to hustle taxpayer-financed largesse for their clients; barriers to needed reforms of school quality and discipline; . . . [and above all] the smug assumption that Washington knows best how the nation's schools should be run. 
While various professional organizations have more or less been required to endorse this bill because, as I have already said, it is an improvement over present law, just last month, USA Today published the results of a poll of 6,000 principals, 80 percent of whom said Federal law interfered with their ability to create safe schools. 
My two friends on this side of the aisle used the word `balance.' There is no balance in this bill. There is no balance at all. There is no consideration--no consideration, none--of the rights of nondisabled students. Yes, there are 16,000 school districts in this country. That is the genius of our country, that we solve our problems locally, and yet as far as these are concerned, we should have one school district, one Department of Education that should set one set of rules applicable to everyone under all circumstances and at all times. That is wrong. Let our teachers and our principals and our school boards make the decisions as to how their schools should be operated. 
If all time has been taken on the other side, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this bill is a clear improvement over present law. Nevertheless, it remains a $35 billion per year almost totally unfunded mandate on the school districts of our country. It takes away control over quality of education that they can provide and, regrettably, in spite of the fact that it is a slight improvement, I am constrained to vote against it.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as you know, it is the custom in the Senate to ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with. I did not ask for that unanimous consent this afternoon because I wanted to demonstrate that the amendment before us is exactly 7 lines long, to be added to a bill which is 327 pages long--327 pages of detailed requirements imposed on each and every school district in the United States of America from New York City to Los Angeles to one of my own, Harrington, WA, a small school district in a rural farm area. 
I will recap only briefly the remarks that I made yesterday relating to this entire bill, and then I will attempt to fit this amendment into some of the objections, perhaps the single most important objection that I have to the bill that is before us. 
As was the case yesterday, I must start by saying that we are not operating here today on a clean slate. An Individuals With Disabilities Education Act has been a part of the law of the United States for the last couple of decades. This revises and reauthorizes that proposal. On the narrow question of whether or not this bill is somewhat easier for school districts to administer and grants them somewhat more authority than they have at the present time, the answer can only be in the affirmative. If our only choice was between a continuation of the current law and the adoption of this bill, I would have to confess that this bill would be superior. Nevertheless, it retains all of the profound policy and balancing of power objections that are applicable to the current law to such extent that the relatively modest improvements in this bill simply do not make it an appropriate law to be passed by the Congress of the United States and imposed on every school authority and on every student and on every teacher of the United States. So it is with deep regret, and in spite of the view that the education of the disabled is an important priority, that some aid and assistance, at least, of the Federal Government to that end is an important priority, that I present this amendment and oppose the bill as a whole. 
It seems to me that fundamentally the objections to the bill fall into two quite separate categories. The first and the easiest to understand is that this bill, as is the case with the current IDEA statute, imposes a huge unfunded mandate on all of the school systems of the United States. We are told, I believe by the Congressional Budget Office, that the costs imposed on the school districts of the United States next year, 1998, in that 1 year alone, will be $35 billion. That number is greater than the sum of all of the discretionary appropriations for education from kindergarten through high school passed by this Congress. As against that $35 billion mandate, we will appropriate somewhere between $3 and $4 billion to the States and the school districts when we have finished our work for the year. For the current year, the figure is just over $3 billion. So, perhaps for every $10 of costs and expenses we impose on our school districts, we will reimburse our schools $1. 
It is difficult for me to imagine any Member of the U.S. Senate standing up on this floor supporting this bill if that Senator had to persuade the Congress to appropriate $35 billion to enforce it. Given the nature of our budget challenges, given our bipartisan desire for a balanced budget, given the agreement between the President of the United States and the leadership of the Congress on the budget for this year, we would not be able to find that $35 billion without repealing all of the other aid to K-12 education bills and a number of our higher education expenditures as well. 
So, what Congress is doing in this bill, just as it has done for the last 20 years, is saying to each school district: We know what is best for you. We are going to tell you what you have to do. But we are not going to pay for it. This is, I am informed, the largest unfunded mandate we impose in the U.S. Congress except for some of our environmental mandates that are spread out over the private sector as well as over the public sector. It is, we are told by the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations, the piece of legislation that creates the fourth greatest amount of litigation of any of the statutes of the United States. Why? Because of its immense complexity. 
So, fundamentally, it is wrong that we should be debating a bill like this, or its predecessor, because we are not willing to pay for the consequences of our own actions. We make the rules. We do not pay the bills. That is the first objection to the bill, and I must confess the amendment I have just introduced does nothing about that unfunded mandate whatsoever. 
The second objection has to do with the highly valid but nevertheless extremely narrow focus of the bill. The theory of the bill, the philosophy of the bill, is to guarantee a free public education to all disabled students or potential students of a grade-school or high-school age. The focus is narrow because the bill allows school districts, in providing this education, to focus on nothing else. With respect to the bill and its mandates, no other interests are even relevant. The costs of providing the education are not relevant. The individual education plan can be literally unlimited in the cost for an individual student--costs which obviously come out of the same pool of money which educates every other student and thus deprives each and every other student of what that money could furnish. The safety of the schoolroom or the school grounds is not a relevant consideration, with the narrowest of limitations, slightly broadened by this bill over current law. The classroom environment for all of the other students is not relevant in the decisions that are made under this bill. 
So, whatever the impact on all of the other students, the school district simply may not consider them. Only the beneficiaries of the bill and their perceived welfare, by their parents or by an administrative officer or by a court, may be considered. 
One parent in the State of Washington wrote to me on this 
subject and made the following statement:  
I recently asked my school district attorney what rights I had as a parent when the education program of my child was interrupted by the behaviorally disabled due to legal decisions. His response was, you have no rights. 
`You have no rights.' 
Yesterday, I shared with my colleagues a letter from a parent in California who responded, as I suspect thousands of others have responded, to this frustrating decision by taking her child out of the school system entirely. She was required to find privately financed education for just such a student. In this connection, the fundamental flaw in this law, as in its predecessor, is the double standard it sets both for disciplinary proceedings and for classroom environment. Every school district in the United States retains all of the powers that it had previously to discipline students for what in a different context would be criminal offenses--weapons, drugs, assaults and the like. Every school district retains the authority to act on behalf of the majority of its students with respect to classroom atmosphere and environment so a learning environment conducive to the learning of all can be enforced. 
If, however, a student is disabled or contrives to get a finding of disability, all of those rules go out of the window. Discipline is severely limited. The right of ultimate and complete expulsion is wiped out entirely, and an elaborate set of requirements that take up many of the 327 pages of this bill are substituted, including legal proceedings in which attorney's fees can be imposed against the school district but not against a parent, even if the parent loses that litigation. And, inevitably, this double standard communicates itself to the students, to the subjects of our education system. 
Again, Mr. President, I would like to share with you a comment from the superintendent of the Edmonds School District in the State of Washington. Edmonds is a relatively prosperous, relatively large Seattle suburban school district. Brian Benzel, its superintendent, writes: 
Our major frustration is that we continue to have high expectations for programs thrust on us by the regulations with very little resources to achieve those expectations. 
The result is that good people do not understand why we do some of the things we do because they defy common sense. When we try to explain the regulations and the requirements, we all come away as losers and the public support necessary for the public schools is undermined. 
We have had several incidents with guns and dangerous knives. We have a strong policy and clearly set an expectation that possession of these items will result in expulsion. At same time, we often get into time-consuming and expensive due process hearings where our principals are the focus of concern rather than the student's behavior. We all begin to think we're attorneys rather than educators. 
Another letter from the superintendent of the Othello School District, a rural school district: 
Already this morning I have received two phone calls from principals asking for advice regarding disciplining disabled students. One student is in possession of a knife for the second time this year, and another middle school student has threatened to kill another student. Each time the principal is faced with one of these situations, s/he should not have to worry about negative consequences for trying to provide a safe environment for all of their staff and students. . . . please don't tie the hands of the administrators that are trying so hard to provide a safe learning environment for all of their students. 
This is a field which has made modest progress, but it is very modest. Expulsion, as one of the superintendents spoke about, still is not an alternative. And so, Mr. President, the amendment that I have sent to the desk, and I wish to read it just once again, in its entirety it reads: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, each State educational agency or local educational agency may establish and implement uniform policies with respect to discipline and order applicable to all children within its jurisdiction to ensure the safety and appropriate educational atmosphere in its schools. 
No more and no less than that. No more and no less than considering maybe perhaps our local school boards, our principals and our teachers know more about running their classrooms and are equally concerned with all of their children as we are, we, in this artificial atmosphere, setting out 327 pages of regulations for the ordering of our public schools. Mr. President, that would be wrong if we paid for it, and, as I said earlier, we are not paying for it. Most States have laws relating to the education of the disabled. Most teachers in school districts would do the best job they possibly could in the absence of regulations, even from the State, and yet we feel in our wisdom we can set up one set of rules applicable to every school district across the country that ignores completely individual situations taking place in individual school rooms, each slightly different than the other, and that we can ignore completely the educational atmosphere in which the vast majority of our students live and work. 
Is it any wonder that since the passage of this act, we have a constantly increasing number of students who are denominated disabled, when every incentive to a parent is to get such a designation, when we have a large number of so-called experts who will say that the very fact that a student disrupts the classroom is proof of disability, so that the disruption cannot be effectively sanctioned? 
I believe that it is inevitable that even if we pass this slightly improved law, the number, the share of those who are denominated disabled will continue to increase; the percentage, the share of the limited dollars available for education will continue to increase. The amount of litigation and lawyer's fees, coming straight out of the educational budget, will continue to increase. One size does not fit all, and my amendment will not cure all of the shortcomings of this bill. It will leave intact the absolute requirement that a free public education be provided to every individual, disabled or not. That will not be affected. It will not solve the money problem of an unfunded mandate. 
It will, however, allow the reimposition of a single standard for discipline, classroom safety and classroom environment to be determined by the school authorities most affected by those standards. It will end the process of student after student leaving the public schools because of the impact of the bills, teachers leaving the profession because of the impact of those bills, and the fact that many of us, I know in my own case, receive more complaints about this aspect of the Federal program for education in the United States than we do on any other single subject. 
So, knowing in this case that the odds are stacked against me, 
I have tried to present this amendment in the simplest possible fashion. You either believe in a single standard of discipline and safety and educational atmosphere or you do not. If you believe in it, if you believe in the essential goodness and expertise of the people who are providing our children with their education, you will vote for the amendment. If you disbelieve in that good faith, if you disbelieve in that expertise, your problems and our problems with our public schools are far greater than those dealt with in this amendment. Free our school boards and our teachers and our administrators to provide the education we demand of them for all of our children. Free them by adopting this amendment.  
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am sorry to interrupt. I know the Senator from Iowa wishes to speak, as do some Senators on this side. Unfortunately, I am now 1 hour late to a hearing that I am supposed to preside over. So I would like to make just one or two remarks after which I will yield the balance of my time to the control of Senator Smith and he can proceed as he wishes. 
Mr. President, I believe firmly that the case for my amendment has been established by the last two speakers, the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Indiana. We have heard a wave of arguments about manifestation determinations and individual education plans and the fine distinctions between various forms of violence and disorder. My good friend from Vermont has informed me not only that he knows more about education in the State of Washington than I do, but that he knows more about education in the State of Washington than do the superintendents of my schools in the State of Washington. Mr. President, that is the heart of this debate. 
If, in fact, you believe the Senator from Vermont knows more about how education ought to be provided to students in the State of Washington and in your State of Idaho, Mr. President, than do the professionals, the teachers and the administrators and the citizen school board members in your State and mine, then by all means, you should vote against my amendment and you should vote for this bill. If you believe that what uniformity means in education in the United States is that we should have 
exactly the same rules relating to discipline applicable to every one of the thousands of school districts and millions of students in the United States, then you should vote against my amendment and you should vote for this bill. If, however, you believe that uniformity means something quite different, and that is that the rules should be uniform with respect to every student in a given school rather than a demonstrable double standard, in which the student sitting at this desk is subject to one set of rules and the student at that desk, a totally different set of rules, that that student can do things without significant discipline that this student can't, then you should vote for my amendment. 
Somewhat naively, I had thought that all of us believed that education was so important that the most vital decisions relating to it ought to be made as close to the student and parent as possible. My friend from Indiana spoke of involving the parents more in these decisions. This bill does, but only those parents whose children can be determined to be disabled. What about the parents of the nondisabled students? Well, the quote from the letter to me, I simply need to repeat:  
I recently asked my school district attorney what rights I had as a parent when the education program of my child was interrupted by the behavioral disabled due to legal decisions. His response was, `You have no rights.' 
Yes, if uniformity means the same rule for every school district, for every school board member, for every principal across the country, then this bill is going in the right direction and my amendment is going in the wrong direction, except, of course, that we are making the rules but we are not paying the bills. 
I heard something about this being a constitutional responsibility. Well, Mr. President, if it were a constitutional responsibility, we would not have to legislate at all. But just recently, under the present law, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the State of Virginia ruled that the Virginia law that stated that there were certain offenses that were egregious enough to allow for the absolute expulsion of a student applied equally to the disabled and to the nondisabled. 
No constitutional right for this egregious behavior was found to limit the discretion of the school authorities of Virginia. This bill reverses that decision. It says, `Oh, no, Virginia, you have to have a double standard. You can expel the nondisabled. You cannot expel the disabled no matter what the offense.' 
That is what this bill says. That is not required by the Constitution of the United States. That is a value judgment made by the sponsors and the writers of this bill. 
Mr. President, I said yesterday--and it bears repeating just one more time--I have asked school districts to serve as advisory committees to me in every county of the State of Washington with whom I visit. I try to visit at least once a year, and sometimes more than once. Every one of them has someone who is a teacher or a school board member or a principal. This subject is the one brought up by far the most often by all of the people who actually provide education--the interference in the system. Oh, it is true, as the Senator from Vermont said, there are fewer lawsuits over it now than there were a few years ago. Why? Because the school district can't win the lawsuit. So it now surrenders before the process is so much as started. But the costs of that surrender are paid by every other student in those schools. 
So I repeat one last time. Mr. President, if the Senators in this body who have written this bill know more about schools and about education--not just another Senator--than the people who have devoted their lives to public schools and to education, then you should follow their example. 
Of course, many of the educational organizations have agreed with this bill. Their alternative was even worse--the present system. I don't blame them. I commend them for doing so. But, Mr. President, that doesn't mean they like it. That doesn't mean they think we know what we are doing. That means they were told that this was the most they could get, and you either go along or get lost. And they have chosen to go along. And they made a wise decision. But we don't have to make that decision. We can decide, if we wish, that these are the decisions that ought to be made by educators--not Senators. And, if you believe that, you vote for the Gorton amendment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I stand before you and my 
colleagues here in the Senate today in a situation for which I can remember no parallel during the course of my career. It is a position with which I have struggled considerably, not just as we worked toward the scheduling of this bill, but for the course of more than the last 2 years. 
I have an amendment to this bill, which I will introduce later on this afternoon, which I suspect, given the nature of this debate, has very little chance of acceptance. I will oppose this bill as one that I consider imposes not only an unfunded but an unwarranted mandate literally on every school district, every school director, every school administrator, every teacher in the public school systems of the United States. 
At the same time, Mr. President, I want to pay heartfelt tribute to the distinguished Senator from Vermont, who is managing the bill, to the distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee, who has perhaps spent more time on it during his 2-plus years in the U.S. Senate than he has on any other issue and, probably, than any other Senator has in that time. From their perspective--and it is a valid perspective--this bill represents a substantial step in the right direction from the current Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. 
It represents a careful balancing on their part of the many, the strong, the articulate lobbies on each side of the disability issues that surround this bill. In fact, it represents an exquisite compromise dealing effectively with at least some of the interests of every group involved in public education, except for the students and the quality of education that they are provided in our public schools. 
Education may be the single issue with the highest degree of prominence that will be discussed during the course of this Congress. The President has made both some real progress and far more rhetorical progress in bringing the quality of education provided for our students today, as they move into their lives in the 21st century, than he has on any other issue. This bill, however, has not played a significant part in that rhetoric. And almost nothing in the drafting or the debate over this bill has concerned itself with the overall quality of education that will be provided to the great mass of our young people as they move into an increasingly competitive world and increasingly competitive environment. 
No, Mr. President, this bill is aimed, as is its predecessor, at a relatively small, though growing--and I will speak to the nature of that growth a little later--element in our population who are subject to a number of disabilities. Like so many of our other statutes in many other fields, its focus is so narrow that it avoids entirely, or interferes with, the overall quality of education provided to all of our young people, together with the rights of those who are closest to those young people--their parents, their teachers, their school administrators, their elected school board members--to make judgments about how best to provide the best possible education for the largest number of students. We hear soaring rhetoric about the need for higher educational standards as we move into the 21st century. But, Mr. President, I regret to say that this bill will not help us in any way in providing those higher standards. In fact, it will increasingly interfere with and frustrate their attainment. And yet, I must return to the very real tribute and credit that ought to be paid to those on the committee of jurisdiction who have drafted this, not on a blank slate, but on the slate that has been inscribed with the current IDEA. 
Some of the remarks that I will make during the course of this debate, coming from individual parents or school districts, will of course relate to the enforcement of the law as it exists at the present time. But I believe, very much to my regret, that they will apply with equal force and merit to the bill that is before us, should it become law. 
The fundamental flaw with this bill, and with the present law, Mr. President, is that it imposes on every school district in the United States a double standard with respect to school discipline, with respect to order in the classroom, with respect to priorities in connection with the financial, the fiscal investment in our children's education. 
It is overwhelmingly an unfunded mandate of exactly the type the last Congress, at least so far as the future was concerned, tried to avoid. It is, however, an unfunded mandate in another sense. There is hardly a Member of this body, Republican or Democrat, who does not give eloquent lip service to the proposition of local control and local influence over our schools, particularly in their day-to-day operations, and even when we feel that certain national levels of achievement ought to be set--perhaps not imposed, but at least set against which to measure attainment. 
Yet, I pick up this bill, S. 717, and I note that it is 327 pages long, every page of which imposes a detailed mandate on the system of schools in New York City, NY, on the system of schools in the smallest and most rural district in the State of Kansas, or in the State of Washington--rules which cannot possibly be set in a universal fashion applicable to every student in every situation in every school district in a world which truly values education and truly believes that so much of education results from the dynamics of an individual teacher and an individual student. 
I had intended literally to read some of these requirements to you here, and I must confess that unless I wished to engage in a filibuster, I do not have time to do so. But in this bill, beginning on page 141, there are detailed procedural safeguards on behalf of any individual who claims a disability and who claims that that disability has not been dealt with precisely according to the rules in the other 300-plus pages of the statute. Those procedural requirements begin on page 141 and end on--well, I have not gotten to the end yet. I am at page 156 and working through this set of requirements--20, 30 or more pages simply of procedural requirements applicable to each disabled student, applicable to each school district, applicable to each individual determination. The only thing missing in those procedural requirements is the slightest expression of concern for any of the great majority of students who are not disabled, of the problems of individual teachers and individual classrooms or of the overall quality of education that will be provided by school districts subjected to the mandates included in this statute. 
The amendment that is before the body now proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] would raise from about 7 percent the current level of support from the Federal Government to defray the mandates imposed by this bill to somewhere closer to 40 percent that the original Individuals With Disabilities Education Act purported to mandate or at least to authorize. 
The Senator from Vermont has said that he has great sympathy with the Gregg amendment but that he must oppose it, and it will undoubtedly be defeated. We can afford to make the requirements but we cannot afford to pay for them. Why? Perhaps the Senator from Vermont will correct me on this. Because if we were to do so, if we were to pay entirely for the requirements we lay out in this statute, we would not have any money left over for any other educational purpose from K through 12. None of the wonderful promises of the President or of a multitude of Members of this body. 
In fact, Mr. President, I will be blunt. If the Congress were forced to pay all of the costs that it imposes by this bill or by its predecessor on individual school districts, there is not the remotest chance that the statute would ever have been passed in the first place or be passed here today. It would simply be too expensive. We can, however, please certain interest groups by making these requirements and by requiring someone else to pay for them. 
I suspect that you, Mr. President, and the Senator from Vermont and I all remember that magnificent motion picture about World War II, `Bridge on the River Kwai.' I think that is what this bill is. The sponsors or their predecessors who wrote the first bill have built a magnificent bridge that is a tremendous engineering feat, the net result of which is to lower the quality of education in the United States. We are looking at the bridge and not at the results of building that bridge. 
I spoke a little earlier about double standards. Overwhelmingly, the double standards in this bill have to do with rules of discipline. Perhaps the most fundamental authority in a local school district or of a State educational authority is setting rules of discipline designed for two purposes: one, to ensure to the maximum possible extent the physical safety of schools and teachers in schools and in an educational situation, and, second, to see to it that the atmosphere in those schools is one that is as conducive to learning as it can possibly be. And for the entire history of the Republic until the passing of the predecessor to this bill that authority, subject only to the Constitution, was delegated entirely to individual school districts. 
This bill, as its predecessor, sets up a dramatic double standard. For a nondisabled student, there is no change. For a disabled student, there is a tremendous change. Disciplinary procedures are greatly limited, are subjected to all of the procedural requirements that--I was going to say outlined--the details of which I described earlier, in such fashion that 
the slowest student cannot possibly escape as a part of his or her learning process if there is one rule for you and a very, very different rule for me, one that you can't get away with that I can get away with--not a very good set of lessons for impressionable young people on their way to becoming productive citizens. 
Now, what does this double standard do? Well, the proponents of the bill say, accurately, it prevents discrimination against students with disabilities, a wholesome and a valuable goal--a goal, I may say, incidentally, I think most school districts believe in and would reasonably enforce without any interference by the Federal Government, a goal on which most States have statutes themselves, here preempted by what we do. 
But there are other consequences of this double standard. The first is an overwhelming incentive for parents and for lawyers and for certain students to act in such a fashion that they can receive the designation that they are disabled because once you find yourself so designated, most disciplinary rules fly out the window or are greatly limited. You are likely to be entitled to a personal education plan, the cost of which is absolutely unlimited in present law or this bill. You are likely, in a controversy with your school district, to be entitled to a lawyer who will end up being paid for by the school district, that is to say, by the taxpayers, by the other students. And as I have said, whatever the average per student expenditure is in a school district is out the window. The administrative procedure, including a Federal district court, complete with lawyers and attorney's fees, can order any educational setting, any educational expenditure that it deems warranted, looking only at the disabled student, not viewing in any respect whatsoever the impact of those costs on the ability of the school district to provide an education for others.

Mr. GORTON. Is it any wonder that every year, in school district after school district, more and more students find themselves denominated disabled? The incentives to do so are extremely significant. It is reported by the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations that this current bill, of all Federal regulatory statutes, ranks fourth in the amount of litigation that it creates. That is a pretty good record. Of all of the regulatory statutes in the United States, this ranks fourth in the amount of litigation it creates. 
I note another element in that connection. We recently had a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States on a particular form of environmental litigation in which the successful challengers to a particular statute received their attorney's fees. In this bill, however, attorney's fees are a one-way street. If the representative of the individual student claiming discrimination under the statute prevails, that student or that student's family is awarded his or her attorney's fees. If the school district prevails, no attorney's fees can be awarded against the losing party. What does this do? Of course, it encourages litigation. The litigation is free. It also overwhelmingly encourages settlements which many school districts may regard as very, very unwise, simply because the potential downside is so great--again adding immensely to costs imposed on school districts. 
We tend to say `school districts,' but obviously in every case, every dollar paid out in attorney's fees, every disproportionate dollar paid out as a result of litigation or determinations pursuant to the statute, comes out of the finite pool of money that provides education for other students. A marvelous example of the way this works in the real world has taken place right here in the District of Columbia. Recently, the Washington Post highlighted the law firm that makes easy money by bringing administrative complaints and lawsuits over the shortcomings of the District of Columbia's schools' special education system. One of the lawyers quoted in the argument said, `Winning those cases is like taking candy from a baby.' 
I am not here to defend the quality of education in the District of Columbia. I think it is a magnificent paradox that it may spend more money per student than any other school district in the United States, or very close to that, and has pretty close to the worst results, but at least a modest portion of that has to be covered because of the fishing expeditions encouraged by this law that makes winning these cases `like taking candy from a baby.' In my own State of Washington, with which I am more familiar than others, lawyers' costs range from $60,000 a year, $90,000 a year, $300,000 a year, all coming out of the pool of money that would otherwise be used for educating particular children. 
However, I spoke a little earlier about the impact of this legislation on other, nondisabled schoolchildren. On that subject we received a letter from a concerned mother in California. She was working as a parent volunteer in her 5-year-old son's kindergarten classroom. In doing so she observed a student disrupting the classroom with loud outburst, running, kicking, screaming, hitting the teacher and aides. The child was in the class because of what is called, in this law, a full inclusion order. The net result was that my correspondent's 5-year-old child suffered from headaches every day the disruptive child was present in the classroom, was one of the victims of the child's outbursts, was punched by the child. The parent of the disabled child rejected the use of any normal method to control her child. The mother, who wrote me, writes that finally she had no choice but to remove her child from the school. She wrote,  
Fearing for my son's physical and emotional well-being, I finally removed my child from the kindergarten system. This occurred after the Federal court ordered the school district to readmit the special education student in spite of all the documented behavior aberrations. 
The statute did not protect that volunteer's child in school. It did not provide for her education. It did not guarantee her constitutional right to an adequate public education, because that child, together with the vast majority of other schoolchildren in all of the school systems in the United States, are nonpersons for the purpose of this statute. They do not count. Their safety does not count. The ability to learn in an orderly atmosphere for them does not count because the Congress of the United States has told them that it does not. All that can be considered in these cases is the situation surrounding plaintiff child, the child with a disability. 
One of my own favorite superintendents, who only recently retired, L.E. Scarr, superintendent of the Lake Washington school district, a large suburban district east of Seattle, put it a little differently when he wrote this to me. 
A process which is supposed to result in an education program agreed to by parents and school personnel at times becomes a battleground on which procedures become more important than educational results. 
Teacher after teacher, school district after school district say that this process depreciates, worsens the educational standards that they are able to impose. Dedicated schoolteachers give up their careers because of their frustration at being able to operate in what they consider to be an appropriate educational manner. We simply have not created a situation here in which there can be any balance. Even if it is appropriate for the Congress of the United States to pass legislation on this subject, even if it is appropriate to pass a 327-page bill setting out all of these requirements, is it not appropriate to give to each school district some method by which to determine the best educational outcome for the majority of 
its students? Isn't there some way to say there is some limitation on the amount of limited school district assets that have to be spent on any individual? Isn't there some limitation on the amount of litigation and the amount of attorney's fees that can be imposed on our educational system? Isn't it appropriate that some consideration be given to the safety and educational environment in which the vast majority of our young people are educated? But we do not see that here in this bill. 
I must return one more time to the proposition that, yes, it is an improvement over the present situation. My friend from Vermont, in a less public conversation, said I was not giving him enough credit when I said it was minimal or modest. It was substantial. I may be willing to stand corrected on that and say that there are an additional number of factors relating to immediate physical safety which will authorize at least some discipline against a dangerous but disabled student. And that is a step forward. That is why I, along with many of my colleagues, are, to a certain degree, on the horns of a dilemma when we deal with this bill. 
It would be easy to vote `no' if there were `no' Federal legislation on the subject at all. It is much more difficult when you must admit that, for all the criticisms you can make about the regime which this 327 pages creates, it is still something that is viewed with relief by the National Association of School Boards and the principals' and most of the teachers' organizations. But, it seems to me, that shows not how good this bill is, but how bad the current legislation is: the degree of desperation on the part of our school authorities, who have been willing to sign up for this proposal. I sympathize with them. I think, were I in their position, I would probably have done exactly the same thing, because the consequences of not agreeing were the continuation of the status quo. 
But, here we are, 100 of us in this peaceful but highly artificial set of surroundings, pretending that we are wiser than all of the school board members in the United States of America, pretending that we know more about their business than they do, making frequent speeches about the genius of local school systems and of local school boards but acting in a way that is totally inconsistent with that lip service. 
One of the features I have had in my service in the U.S. Senate in the last 8 years is to create advisory committees in every one of the 39 counties in the State of Washington. I meet with each one of them at least once a year, several of them more than once a year. I have made a conscious attempt in every one of these advisory committees to have at least one member, and sometimes more, who is a teacher, a school administrator, a school board member, in many cases recently a student, so I can hear, each time I meet with one of these groups, about their concerns with respect to the Federal involvement in public education. 
Madam President, I can say--and I am probably understating it--that in the course of the last 2 years, at least three-quarters of the comments that I have received from these people from education has been with respect to this law and the frustrations and the disruptions attendant upon its implementation. 
And so, I must say with some regret that I will feel constrained to vote against this bill for the reasons that I have stated. In preparing for this debate, I agreed with the sponsors that we can probably focus on one, not more than two, particular amendments to set out the differences that we have, and the proponents asked me to come to the floor this afternoon, both to engage in a discussion that is almost complete and to offer an amendment. 
I must say, through the Chair, to the chairman, while my first and perhaps my only amendment is relatively simple, I don't have it in form to offer at this moment, because I didn't like the form in which it arrived in my office from legislative drafting service. 
Unlike the 327-page bill, however, it will take up less than 1 page. It will simply state that notwithstanding any other provision in this statute, each local school authority shall have the right to set rules respective of the safety and educational atmosphere for students in that school system. I hope that I will have the final form of the amendment before this afternoon is up, but we do have another amendment pending at the present time, the funding amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. 
So at this point, I simply want to say that the amendment that I will present and probably will not need to explain to the length I have explained my general position over the course of the last half-hour, the amendment that I will present goes to one element of the heart of this legislation, and that is, who makes decisions with respect to the safety of students in a given school system, who makes decisions with respect to the educational environment in which those students are educated? It does not go to the problem of attorney's fees or elaborate hearings or costs or the like, matters that I think are important but, perhaps, not quite so central to this legislation. 
I will explain it. We will vote on it. I believe that while in our heart of hearts perhaps a majority of the Members of this body agree with me in theory, I am not going to hold my breath until the amendment, or that matter the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, is adopted. But it is healthy, I think vital, that we debate these fundamental concepts when we are talking about the education of our most priceless resource: our young people.

Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I have just a brief supplement to the remarks that I made earlier. 
I referred in general terms to the cost of the mandates under this bill and under the current IDEA legislation. I have checked it, and, at the present time, the current funding level is just over $3 billion. 
The amendment proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. Gregg], would, over roughly a 7-year period, reach the authorized level of having us here in Congress pay for 40 percent of the cost of IDEA and would reach, I am told, something like $13 billion or 
$13.5 billion. It seems to me that is a little short. My own figures are, if we were to fund it at 40 percent for next year, for 1998, the cost to the Congress, to the Federal Government, would be just over $14 billion. Now, that is 40 percent. 
My grade school arithmetic tells me that if the cost were $14 billion at 40 percent, the cost of 100 percent funding would be $35 billion. So we have created and will continue to impose a $35 billion cost on the school districts of the United States for the implementation of the requirements that are set out in the statute. 
Madam President, I went into the Cloakroom and checked how much we put into title I, which is, I believe, the single most expensive of all of our Federal aid to education in specific bills for all the disadvantaged children. 
The basic grants for the current year for title I are a little over $6 billion. When you add all of the special categories under title I, you get almost to $8 billion. 
I am told, without having checked every single one of these, that the second most expensive are the drug-free schools programs, which is roughly $4 billion. 
Now, if I am correct in these, Madam President, I simply go back to the proposition that here we are creating a set of mandates far more expensive than all, I think, of the programs of direct aid for education from kindergarten through the 12th grade. 
I guess I have to ask the manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, if, in fact, we had to come up with $35 million right now for 1998 to pay all of the costs of this bill, and if, in fact, we had to work within the balanced budget agreement that has been entered into between the President and the leadership in the Congress, and if, in fact, paying for this bill caused us to either repeal or substantially wipe out a huge range of other programs of education assistance, would we be imposing this mandate? 
Now, I ask that question rhetorically. I know the answer. Of course we would not be. It is real easy to do it, Madam President, when somebody else has to pay the bill. But the Senator from Vermont is going to oppose even Senator Gregg's amendment, which allows us 7 years to get to 40 percent. 
Now, it is wonderful for us to say our educational theory is this or our educational theory is that. We think this is the way schools ought to be managed or we think that is the way schools ought to be managed. There are two objections to it. First, we do not know as much about the subject as educators do; and, second, I think we have a requirement to put our money where our mouth is. We are not putting our money where our mouth is in this bill. We never have, as long as this predecessor has been the law. 
How do we get to the point at which we tell everybody else in the United States how to run their businesses, but do not pay for it?

Mr. GORTON. I spoke to the Senator recently, Madam President. I have one more modest redraft on my amendment and then we will be able to submit it during the course of the afternoon, I hope in the course of the next hour. I gather there is an attempt to see to it that there is some overall reasonable limitation of debate on the amendments and on the bill to which this Senator is certainly in accord. 
So, we will have that here so Members can read it so the Senator can critique it, as he will, in a relatively short period 
of time.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today is National Tax Freedom Day--the day when families around the country finally start working for themselves and not for the Government. For families in my home State of Washington, however, Tax Freedom Day does not come until May 14. In Washington State, families must work 5 additional days before the income they earn can go to meet their own needs and not the Government's. 
The residents of Washington State will bear the Nation's fifth highest tax burden in 1997 with each man, woman, and child of the State owing $6,572 in Federal taxes. Add this with State and local taxes and each Washington citizen will owe $9,881 or almost 37 percent of the average, annual income to support the Government . 
It is no wonder today's families are feeling squeezed. It is no wonder more and more families must rely on dual incomes and parents must work longer and longer hours. Families are paying more in taxes today than ever. They are now spending more just on taxes then they do on food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. 
This is not fairness. It is robbery. 
Clearly, it is time for Congress to seriously reexamine our current tax system. As Betty Dursh from Spokane, WA, stated in her recent letter to me: 
It is past time to reform the Tax Code. We are now in our fifth year, hear this, our fifth year, of working almost half the year before the taxes are paid. That is unconscionable! It is wrong! 
Yes, Ms. Dursh, it is wrong and it is far past the time for Congress to begin the work of reforming our tax system. 
The budget agreement announced by the President and Congress 1 week ago today gives me hope--hope that we can finally begin to put our fiscal house in order and provide some tax relief for the American people. If our efforts are successful this summer and we are able to begin the job of reforming some of our most oppressive taxes it will be a good step. But it will only be the first, small step in the direction of the real reform we need--reform that will, at last, provide us with a tax system that respects the right of American's to keep their earnings and investments. This will require much more than one or two changes to the volumes of provisions in the Tax Code, however. It will require a complete examination and, eventually, overhaul of the entire system. 
I want to leave my colleagues with one final thought--the words of a 52-year-old woman from Marysville, WA who lost both her husband and her job this past year and who is unable to sell her home to make ends meet because she would be required to give the Government 40 percent of the proceeds of the sale in capital gains tax. Ms. Linda Blasengame has this message for all of us here in Congress: 
I have lost so much and have always fought back but I can't imagine the pain of having to lose my dignity too. Please, look inside your heart and help me and so many others that are in my shoes. . . . I don't need a handout, I need your help. 
Congress must heed the cries for help from people like Ms. Blasengame and we must respond to the outrage of people like Ms. Dursh. The American people are slowly losing patience with our bandaid approaches. Americans overwhelming want a fairer and simpler tax system. They deserve this and they are relying on us to work toward this end.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today on behalf of the thousands of citizens of my home State whose homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed by floods and landslides this year. Washington was hit hard in late December and early January by unprecedented weather patterns that wreaked havoc across the State and again in the spring by flooding caused by snow melt in the mountains. 
Freezing rain, snow, strong winds, and rapidly rising temperatures with warm rains led to unprecedented problems across the State. Mudslides and flooding eroded major roads and bridges, rendering them impassable; small businesses were destroyed by collapsing roofs due to heavy snow; and flooding harmed hundreds of homes and businesses. All but 1 of Washington's 39 counties were declared Federal disaster areas. 
I visited many of the people whose lives and livelihoods were affected by the storms. Traveling across the State in February, I witnessed first hand nature's devastating impact. In Kalama, ground movement caused by soggy soil led a natural gas pipeline to rupture and explode, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air and terrifying nearby neighborhoods. In Edmonds, heavy, wet snow collapsed the roof of a marina housing 400 private boats, causing $15 million in damage. Several homes, roads, and bridges were destroyed by landslides throughout the Seattle area. Tragically, on Bainbridge Island, a family of four was killed when a mudslide buried their home in the middle of the night without warning. And in Yakima, Wenatchee, and across eastern Washington, farms and farm buildings sustained heavy damage. Apple, pear, and potato storage houses and dairy farms were destroyed when roofs collapsed under heavy snow. 
Mr. President, when natural disasters touch the lives of so many people, it is the Federal Government's responsibility to offer a helping hand. The bill before the Senate today will do just that. The $5.8 billion in disaster relief funded by this legislation will go a long way to help Americans hurt by natural disasters across the Nation get back on their feet. Small Business Administration loans will help business and homeowners alike with necessary repairs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will provide assistance to both individuals and State and local governments to repair private homes and businesses and roads and bridges damaged by the storms. And the Corps of Engineers will work to rebuild and strengthen levees and other flood protection measures to provide our communities better protection from rising rivers in the future. 
On behalf of the people of Washington State, I commend Senator Stevens for his dedication and diligence in bringing this legislation to the floor. His work and the work of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee will ensure that America can recover from a particularly harsh winter and spring. This legislation will help millions of people who had the misfortune to be in the path of mother nature. I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to express my deep gratitude and pride in recognizing the Wenatchee National Forest as a recipient of the Salvage Sale Showcase Award under the U.S. Forest Service's Fiscal Year 1995 Timber Salvage and Recovery Program. 
The Wenatchee National Forest encompasses 2.2 million acres of Washington's finest forest lands--lands providing for an abundance of recreational activities and employment and resource opportunities for Washington State residents. In July 1994, however, a lightning storm followed by a severe fire, threatened to suddenly demolish this majestic landscape within days. 
When the last flame had been extinguished, the damage was daunting. Three fires of unprecedented intensity had consumed 186,000 acres of Wenatchee National Forest lands, destroying 37 homes and 76 outbuildings and threatening the lives of human beings who had dared to cross its massive path. Firefighters from various parts of the country, 8,000 in all, fought valiantly to save the precious resources endangered by runaway wildfires. It is to their credit that so many homes, communities, and human lives are intact today. 
Determined and resolute, the employees of the Wenatchee National Forest went to work. Less than 2 months after the first spark ignited, the largest emergency rehabilitation effort ever undertaken by the Forest Service was launched with the cooperation of other Federal, State, county, and local agencies. The rehabilitation effort addressed and executed projects which included erosion control, road rehabilitation, wildlife habitat, helicopter seeding, and collaborative learning. The effort was successfully completed by mid-November 1994, for $18 million--$2 million under budget. 
With the worst behind them, Forest managers looked ahead toward long-term forest health and sustainability. Interdisciplinary teams consisting of personnel from all six ranger districts combined their knowledge and know-how to develop the necessary environmental documents. Within 11 months, these teams assembled an astounding 10 environmental analyses and 1 environmental impact statement. Science-based decisionmaking rendered a total of 22 timber sales, resulting in landscape level fuel treatment on over 30,000 acres. Nearly 138 million board feet of fire killed or damaged timber was offered for sale. 
Salvage was the key to this vision. Removing dead and dying trees provided the much needed opportunity to reduce stress and preserve larger, healthier trees. In addition, salvage logging in the Wenatchee has enhanced wildlife habitat and supported the perpetuation of ancient forest conditions. Mr. President, it is for this very reason that I sponsored timber salvage legislation in the spring of 1995. Not only was the forest able to begin healing and promoting catastrophic fire prevention through salvage operations, it was also able to provide a significant amount of timber for the public benefit. 
In conclusion, I want to congratulate and commend the efforts of all of those who contributed to the successful and innovative restoration of the Wenatchee National Forest. Their accomplishments over the past 3 years are proof positive that we can effectively balance environmental and economic concerns in our national forests if we give local forest managers the flexibility they need to do their jobs. The employees of this forest are outstanding examples of the teamwork desperately needed throughout our national forest system. Because of their professionalism, tenacity, and courage, the Wenatchee National Forest is on its way back to health and sustainability. My congratulations to them on a job well done. Keep up the good work.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, by all accounts, Lt. Kelly Flinn has had a remarkable Air Force pilot's career. Becoming an astronaut was her childhood dream; becoming an Air Force pilot was an achievement accomplished upon completion of her basic pilot training in December 1994. She was the most distinguished graduate of her training class, rated exceptionally qualified to fly a B-52 bomber, an assignment earned from her high class ranking. 
Today, she is confined to a desk job, stripped of her security clearance, grounded, publicly disgraced. On May 20 the Air Force will court martial her for adultery. 
The United States military has experienced its share of scandal in the past 5 years. In Aberdeen, MD, a court-martial jury recently convicted an Army drill sergeant of raping six soldiers under his command. In 1991 the Tailhook scandal rocked the Navy and the Marines. In both instances women were physically abused by their colleagues or superiors, on military facilities or at military functions. The acts committed against these women range from the lewd to the violent. 
Lt. Kelly Flinn stands accused of conducting an affair with a married man, a civilian, who lied to her about his martial status. Their relationship was for all intents and purposes a private matter; they did not attend military functions together or while she was in uniform. If she is convicted, she will be grounded forever, dismissed from the Air Force and could even spend time in prison. 
I call attention to this particular case because I believe it speaks to the highly publicized gender schizophrenia we are witnessing as the military grapples with women's role in our Armed Forces. On one hand, women have had a traditional, but non-expanding role in the military. On the other hand, we are shocked by what appears to be a pervasive resistance to women in the ranks, and the scandals that bear the most extreme illustration of this behavior and mindset. Put differently, assimilation to the military's rules of conduct is separate and distinct from assimilation of the military's culture. 
The Armed Forces are institutions premised on order and command, governed rigidly by rules, written and implied; by codes, some memorized and some unspoken. In some instances however, the strict application of military codes appears to suspend reasonable judgment about the seriousness of the offense committed. 
In this case, clearly, the punishment does not appear to fit the crime. As Lieutenant Flinn says, `I fell in love with the wrong man.' For this offense, which she committed unknowingly because Mr. Zigo lied about being legally separated from his wife, her Air Force career is slated to come to an ignoble end. 
Lets not forget that of those 140 Navy officers involved in Tailhook, none were court-martialed. 
It is difficult for me as an officer who served for more than 20 years as an Air Force judge advocate, to imagine that no other officer at Minot Air Force Base has committed the offense of which Lieutenant Flinn stands accused. 
Wisdom and good judgment seem clearly to demand a dismissal of the criminal charges against Lieutenant Flinn and the substitution of nonjudicial or informal sanctions. I trust that the Air Force will promptly see the wisdom of this suggestion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GORTON. I fully appreciate the sentiments of the Senator from South Dakota. The President's request for emergency funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs is $10,800,000. The Appropriation Committee's recommendation, based on updated information about the costs associated with these storms, is $20,566,000. Of the additional amount included in the committee-reported bill, $1,059,000 is directly attributable to the efforts of Senator Daschle.

Mr. GORTON. Within the $20,566,000 provided for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, an estimated $4,736,000 has been identified for emergency needs in South Dakota, including emergency assistance for the Crow Creek Sioux. In distributing these amounts, I agree that the Bureau should take into consideration additional needs, including those of the Crow Creek Sioux, to the extent that Bureau policy regarding historical priorities for funding Indian roads, tribal administration buildings and irrigation projects is met. In addition, the Bureau must consider the availability of funding through other Federal agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Highway Administration's emergency road program [ERFO].

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Conservation Reserve Program, a program vitally important to my State and many others, has recently been threatened on many fronts. I would like to make clear my intentions and views on several matters relating to the CRP. 
Last week Congressman Bob Smith was successful in passing H.R. 1342, legislation requiring USDA to reenroll winter crop land not accepted in the new CRP for one year. For the record, H.R. 1342 has received strong support from producers in my State and like Chairman Smith, I, too, am very concerned for winter crop producers throughout the country. Unfortunately, we have received a loud message from the President that he strongly objects to the bill and would veto the measure if passed by Congress. 
Knowing the President would veto H.R. 1342, I felt it necessary, at the very least, to send a letter to Secretary Glickman requesting that he permit producers to begin preparing CRP ground immediately for fall planting. I would like producers in my State to know that I will continue to work with Secretary Glickman to see that he addresses this problem. Further, let it be known, that I will oppose any attempt to cap or earmark enrollments to the Conservation Reserve Program. 
Yesterday, 13 Senators joined me in sending a letter to Secretary Glickman outlining 3 critical issues concerning the Conservation Reserve Program. Let me now outline the issues raised in the letter. 
First, producers throughout the country are currently faced with serious uncertainty as to whether or not their bids to enroll land in the CRP will be accepted. I believe it is very important for Secretary Glickman to notify producers this month whether their offers are accepted. I understand that Secretary Glickman is sympathetic to this problem and has announced he will notify all producers by late May. I have expressed my concern to Secretary Glickman and have encouraged him to allow producers to immediately begin preparing their land for fall planting of winter crops without penalty. This will allow producers to begin ground preparation in the event they are not accepted into the program. Producers in my State are concerned they will not have enough time nor enough moisture in the ground to grow winter crops if they do not begin preparing their land immediately. Simply put, time is running out for producers in my State. I understand that Secretary Glickman is willing to help solve this problem and I am hopeful that he will address this situation in a timely fashion. 
Second, the House Appropriations Committee has placed a provision in the Emergency Disaster Supplemental bill capping CRP enrollments at 14 million acres. Many Senators, including myself, believe that this cap threatens the environmental commitment we made when we passed, and the President enacted, the 1996 Farm Bill. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will work hard to see that this provision is omitted during the Emergency Disaster Supplemental Conference. 
Third, the President has proposed reducing CRP enrollments by 2 million acres to pay for the development rights of Crown Butte, Inc. I believe, as do many other Senators, that any cap or reduction in CRP enrollments would jeopardize the commitment Congress made to improve water quality, enhance wildlife habitat, and reduce wind and soil erosion. 
In closing, I thank my colleagues for their support. The CRP is a vitally important program and I look forward to working with my colleagues and Secretary Glickman as we address these concerns.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of those individuals involved with the Outlook Elementary School project in Outlook, WA. Their tremendous generosity will provide the technology our students need to succeed in school and in life. 
The importance of keeping our children abreast of technology is hard to exaggerate. The National Science Foundation reports that over 700,000 new technicians, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers must be found by the year 2010 simply to keep up with technological demands. 
Business and political leaders from around the country have called for increased emphasis on technology in education. Some fear, however, that rural and small-town America could be overlooked in this effort. Seeing this potential problem, Astronaut Bonnie Dunbar enlisted the support of MCI in providing free computers and Internet access to the students of Outlook Elementary School in Outlook, WA. Bonnie Dunbar is a graduate of Outlook Elementary, and is a model and inspiration to many. In the hallway of this small school is the phrase `From Outlook to NASA.' With the generosity of MCI, and the efforts of Bonnie Dunbar, more students will have the benefits of state-of-the-art technology, and also have the stars within their reach.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have thought long and hard on whether I should vote to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. I must admit that as the Convention was originally presented, I was inclined to oppose it. But after three weeks of hard work with the Majority Leader and with the many thoughtful opponents of ratification, I believe we have resolved a significant number of issues in contention and now believe that ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention will do more to reach our common goal of eradicating these deadly and detested weapons from the earth than will non-ratification. 
First, I would like to commend my many constituents, and the thousands of Americans like them, who were relentless in raising their voices against many dangerous aspects of the treaty and its interpretation. Without their vigilance, we would never have reached the point we have today. 
I also commend Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, and the Majority Leader for their work and negotiations with the Administration that has led to vast improvements in the Chemical Weapons Convention ratifying documents. 
Since the beginning of the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, I have stated that the real question is not whether to support the cause of restricting the production, stockpile, and use of chemical weapons throughout the world, but whether the Chemical Weapons Convention itself advanced or inhibited this honorable cause. 
As it was originally presented to the Senate for ratification, Mr. President, I believe the treaty did not advance our cause, but instead inhibited it by making sensitive information on chemicals and chemical weapons technology so readily available as to encourage the proliferation of these hideous weapons. But through the good work of Senator Helms and Senator Kyl, we were able to reach 28 agreements with the Administration. These 28 agreements went a long way toward advancing our cause. I think three of these agreements are particularly important. 
First, I shared the concern of many of my constituents and several former Secretaries of Defense who testified before the Armed Services Committee that the convention would create a false sense of security, not only in the United States, but in nations around the world. It would be easy, Mr. President, for governments to believe that, because the Chemical Weapons Convention is in force, we no longer need to worry about the use of chemical weapons or to prepare ourselves to defend against them. I found this aspect of the treaty to be quite troubling. 
No arms control treaty has yet proven to be perfect. And chemical weapons are far more difficult to detect than missiles or nuclear warheads. Thus, I originally feared that ratification of the treaty would lull us into a false sense of security in which our armed forces would not be properly prepared to deal with a chemical attack. 
I now believe, however, that the agreement reached between Senator Helms and the Administration that ensures our armed forces will continue to receive the equipment and training necessary to complete their missions in the face of chemical weapons is a major improvement 
which will guard against a debilitating false sense of security. 
Second, I and many of my constituents had grave concerns about the treaty's impact on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The treaty, in its original form, did not go far enough to protect U.S. citizens and businesses from involuntary inspections. The treaty's provisions on challenge inspections of chemical producing facilities in the United States did not, in my opinion, comply with the Constitution. 
I am pleased that the administration has agreed to a condition to protect the Fourth Amendment rights of all Americans and to conform the Chemical Weapons Convention to the United States Constitution. According to this condition, before the U.S. deposits its instrument of ratification, the President must certify to Congress that for any challenge inspection in the United States for which consent has been withheld, the inspection team must first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. For any routine inspection of a declared facility in the United States that is conducted on an involuntary basis, the inspection team must obtain an administrative search warrant from a United States magistrate judge. 
I am now confident that this agreement will ensure that the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens and businesses will be protected under the treaty. I commend Senators Helms and Kyl and the administration for their work on this vitally important condition. 
Third, I was troubled by the treaty's impact on the use of non-lethal riot control agents. Since the Chemical Weapons Convention was originally drafted, there has been a great deal of debate in the United States on whether the treaty language would preclude American armed forces from using non-toxic riot control agents. Tear gas and other such chemicals provide the United States military with an invaluable tool when conducting sensitive operations. Tear gas, for example, is an excellent means of rescuing downed pilots, or avoiding unnecessary loss of life when enemy troops and civilians are in the same area. 
I am pleased with the agreement that has been reached on this issue. According to a condition the administration has now accepted, the President will certify to Congress that the United States is not restricted by the convention in the use of riot control agents in the following situations: (1) in the conduct of peacetime military operations within an area of ongoing armed conflict when the United States is not a party to the conflict; (2) in consensual peacekeeping operations when the use of force is authorized by the receiving state; and (3) in peacekeeping operations when force is authorized by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. The agreement also leaves in place Executive Order 11850 signed by President Ford which cites four cases where the use of riot control agents should be permissible under the Chemical Weapons Convention: avoiding unnecessary loss of life, subduing rioting enemy POWs, protecting supply convoys, and rescuing a downed pilot from enemy troops or a POW from behind enemy lines. I commend the administration for agreeing to this reasonable and necessary condition. It will ensure that the men and women of the United States armed forces have the tools necessary to do their jobs in precarious situations. 
While the 28 agreements made did go a long way to improve the Chemical Weapons Convention, I still had one remaining concern, in my view the most important concern, until this morning. That concern relates to Articles X and XI of the convention and the proposition that they might well force the United States to share sensitive information on our chemical weapons defense capabilities and to eliminate our export controls on dangerous chemicals. 
Article X of the treaty obliges all parties to provide assistance and protection to any State Party threatened by the potential use of chemical weapons, including information on chemical weapons defense and detection. Article XI of the treaty obliges all parties to freely exchange chemicals, equipment and scientific and technical information relating to the development and application of chemistry for purposes not prohibited by the Convention. It forbids parties to the treaty to maintain export controls that would restrict the trade and development of chemicals and chemical technology with other treaty parties. 
Ironically, these provisions of the treaty, a treaty designed to eliminate the proliferation of chemical weapons, could in fact promote that very proliferation. If the United States is forced under the treaty to provide this sensitive technology to countries such as Iran, China, or Cuba, those countries could use that information to develop weapons against which we have no ability to defend. 
It is my contention that Articles X and XI do more to inhibit the cause of eradicating chemical weapons than they do to promote it. Thus, they comprise a fatal flaw in the Chemical Weapons Convention. And, until today, I was inclined to vote against ratification because of my concerns on Articles X and XI. 
I am pleased to say, however, that the distinguished Majority Leader was remarkably successful in his negotiations with the President on this most important aspect of the debate on the treaty. I commend him for his diligence and commend the President for his wisdom in responding to our concerns. 
This morning, the President sent Senator Lott a letter in which he extended a promise that the United States will withdraw from the Convention if Articles X and XI are used by other treaty parties to undermine the intent of the Convention. The specific circumstances under which the President agreed to withdraw from the treaty are as follows: (1) if Article X is used to justify actions that could degrade U.S. defensive capabilities; (2) if Article XI erodes the Australia Group export controls; and (3) if Article XI promotes increased proliferation of chemical weapons. 
With this assurance from the President, I am now prepared to support the Chemical Weapons Convention and will vote for its ratification. With the 28 agreements Senator Helms and Senator Kyl were able to negotiate, and with this final commitment from the President, I am comfortable with the treaty. The Convention has been transformed from one doing more harm than good, to one promoting rather than inhibiting the cause of eradicating chemical weapons from the earth. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me say that these changes could not have been made without the diligent and good-faith negotiating done by the majority leader, and without the voices raised by thousands upon thousands of Americans who went out of their way to draw attention to the treaty's many flaws. They should be given the lion's share of credit for the conditions and modifications we have made that make the Chemical Weapons Convention a more workable, more responsible treaty.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am introducing this evening, along with Senators Ashcroft, McCain, and Lott, a bill to reform and rationalize our product liability system. 
At the beginning of this session, Senator Ashcroft and others introduced S.5, another measure to address product liability. Although I agreed with the substance of S.5, which was identical to the conference report on Product Liability that the President vetoed in the 104th Congress, I did not co-sponsor S.5 because I knew that that particular bill would not be enacted into law and because I wanted to craft another bill that would obtain bi-partisan support in the Senate, address the President's legitimate concerns with the conference report, and accomplish meaningful reform. 
Mr. President, I cannot say that the measure I am introducing tonight fully accomplishes that. But it comes very close. I introduce this measure without the co-sponsorship of my good friend and long-time companion on this worthy mission, Senator Rockefeller, but I introduce it with the sincere belief that we will continue to work together to enact product liability reform in 1997. 
I introduce this measure to get the process started. It is a good measure that I believe goes a long way toward meeting the goals I described above. But as I said, the process is just starting. I welcome input from my Republican and Democratic colleagues.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I want to introduce my remarks by expressing my view that this has been a remarkably thoughtful and important debate in the finest traditions of the Senate, not only here on the Senate floor but during the months leading up to it. Perhaps one of the reasons for that is that all Members are united in detesting the use of chemical weapons, divided only by their views on how best to succeed in reaching that goal, and working toward reaching that goal with a high degree of good will and accommodation to one another. So, essentially, from the beginning, the only real question has been: Does this convention advance or inhibit the cause of limiting or eliminating the use of chemical weapons all around the world? 
Mr. President, at the very beginning of the debate when the convention was first submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee, I was inclined to fall on the side of that debate that said that the convention probably was worse than nothing because of the overwhelming false sense of security it created, a sense of security that it could not match in its provisions on a wide range of activities attempted to be covered by it. 
But as we vote tomorrow, Mr. President, I don't believe we are going to be voting on the original bare bones understanding of the convention. The administration and the proponents on this floor have agreed to some 28 conditions, or explanations, or interpretations of the convention, each of which has contributed to a greater degree of comfort with the balance of the convention and its ratification. Three are particularly important to me. One measure ensures that the Chemical Weapons Convention does not lead to a false sense of security--a false sense that is going to be there no matter what we do, but is at least limited by some specific promises on the part of the administration. 
Second, the clarification of the affect of the convention on the use of riot control agents. 
Third, and vitally important to us and to our constitutional rights, are the fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. 
That is not to say that the other 25 conditions aren't important, Mr. President, but these 3, at least, have been particularly significant, in my view, as I have listened to both sides during the course of this debate. 
Nevertheless, I am not yet willing at this point to commit to voting in favor of ratification because of my deep concerns with articles X and XI of the convention, and the proposition that they might well force the United States to share technologies and allow the world, by its sale of chemicals, to a far greater extent, and those technologies and chemicals may be sold at least by responsible and free nations in the world today under the aegis of the Australia Group. 
It would be ironic indeed if, in the guise of passing a treaty or a convention to lessen the opportunity for the use of chemical weapons in the future we actually enhanced it by assisting those nations that are willing to sign the convention but which, like Iran, have shown, without the slightest ability to contradict the proposition, that they do not regard any treaty, any convention, as binding on them, and who are more likely than not to use the convention to advance their own ability to violate it. 
And so, Mr. President, as I make up my own mind during the course of the next 24 hours, it is the impact of articles X and XI that cause me the greatest degree of concern. I don't believe that we can simply strike them from the treaty. That vote tomorrow seems to me to be the equivalent of saying, no, of killing the convention in its entirety. I do believe, however, that we should continue to work toward clarification and understandings on the part of the administration, as I know the majority leader is doing in this, as he has in many of the other questionable elements of this convention, so that we can be assured that the United States at least will not be required to do something that will undercut its own security and that of its friends and neighbors by the convention, that it is not required to do in the absence of that convention. 
So if my concerns with respect to the actual impact in the real world of articles X and XI are met, I will vote to ratify the convention. If they are not, it will remain, in my mind, a situation in which the convention increases our danger rather than obviates them. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators McConnell, Grams, Moynihan, and Lieberman in cosponsoring the Auto Choice Reform Act, a measure that offers consumers a quick-pay, low-cost policy to replace their current policies--policies that are grossly inflated by the costs of damage claims for pain and suffering. 
Auto Choice Reform Act. Choice. Removing the perverse incentives to inflate damages that our current system creates, and allowing consumers to make rational choices, lies at the heart of this bill. Unlike some other no-fault measures, the Auto Choice Reform Act gives consumers, and States, choices. Choices which, if exercised, should significantly lower insurance premiums. For States, the choice is whether or not to offer the no-fault option to residents. A State can opt out legislatively, or if the State commissioner of insurance shows that a no-fault system will not result in a 30 percent decrease in bodily injury premiums for those who choose PPI. If States choose to offer the no-fault option, however, consumers still have the choice of whether or not to participate in the no-fault system. No driver will be deprived of her ability to sue, but instead, can choose between two systems. 
If they want, consumers can avail themselves of the new no-fault insurance system that the bill creates. If a consumer elects the personal protection insurance [PPI] system, then, in the event of an accident, and regardless of fault, she is compensated by her own insurer for economic losses, such as car repair, medical expenses or lost wages, up to her policy limit. She does not, however, recover for noneconomic losses, pain and suffering, and she may not be sued for pain and suffering damages. If her economic damages exceed her policy limit, however, she may sue for economic damages. By taking the often-inflated damages for pain and suffering out of the equation, consumers choosing PPI should see a significant savings in their insurance premiums--a savings that has been estimated at $243 per policy. 
Motorists who choose not to participate in the no-fault system are allowed that option under this legislation. Again, the choice is with the consumer. By opting for what the bill refers to as tort maintenance coverage, a TMC driver can keep her traditional liability policy under which she can sue other TMC drivers for both economic and noneconomic damages. To cover noneconomic damages in accidents with PPI drivers, who TMC drivers cannot sue for noneconomic damages, the TMC driver can purchase a supplemental policy and recover the noneconomic damages from her own insurer. 
What does all of this mean? The New York Times perhaps summed it up best in an editorial that predicted that Auto Choice `would give families the option of forgoing suits for non-monetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.' Mr. President, I hope the Senate will act promptly to pass this bill.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like a clarification of the scope and intent of the committee's third amendment to S. 104. That amendment, which is incorporated into section 204(b)(1)(D) of the act, states that the President shall not designate the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington as the site for construction of an interim storage facility. 
Am I correct in my belief that this amendment defines interim storage facility in a way that would not preclude steps that the Washington Public Power Supply System might need to take with regard to the storage of the spent nuclear fuel generated at the WNP-2 facility?

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, the Senate will take up and pass H.R. 412, legislation authorizes a settlement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District in Washington State. Senator Murray and I introduced identical legislation on this subject earlier this month. 
The reason for the speedy passage of this legislation is directly related to the settlement entered into between the Bureau of Reclamation and the irrigation district. This legislation will authorize a carefully negotiated settlement between the BOR and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District. When enacted, this legislation will save the BOR, and therefore the Nation's taxpayers, money that would otherwise be spent fighting with the irrigation district in court. The administration supports the legislation. 
The reason for quick action on this legislation is the fact that the settlement between the irrigation district and the BOR requires enactment of the legislation by April 15, 1997. If the legislation is not enacted by that date, the irrigation district would have to refile its claim against the Government, and we'd be right back where we started--in court. As a result, Chairman Murkowski, and Senators Bumpers and Kyl have carefully considered my request for quick action and have noted the unique circumstances surrounding this legislation. I would like to thank Senators Murkowski, Bumper, and Kyl for working with me to get this legislation passed quickly. This is truly a unique situation, which calls for quick action.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has just introduced and explained to the Senate two alternative budget resolutions. 
He has, as a matter of courtesy, introduced the President's budget without change, but with the analysis and economic impacts that it will cost made by the Congressional Budget Office. 
The Senator from New Mexico has also introduced a budget, a sparse and bare-bones budget, that he feels will be required as almost the only responsible answer to the refusal of the President of the United States seriously to consider entitlement reform in his budget. 
In order to bring the budget of the United States in balance by the year 2002, in order to get the huge fiscal dividend of more than $75 billion that economists tell us will result from a balanced budget, in order to provide the economic opportunities and the increased income to Americans across the country that a balanced budget will provide, in order to end the practice of spending money today and sending the bills to our children and grandchildren, the Senator from New Mexico has introduced a budget that does no more and no less in the way of entitlement reform than the inadequate proposals of the President of the United States, accepts the conservative projections of our economy made by our own Congressional Budget Office and, therefore, includes no room--and I emphasize no room, Mr. President--for overdue and deserved tax relief for the American people. 
Even without any tax relief for the American people, this set of decisions requires reductions in domestic discretionary spending that are extremely drastic, more than twice those that either the President or most of us, as Republicans on the Budget Committee, feel to be appropriate. In addition to leaving no room for any tax relief, this budget has no room for any of the new initiatives proposed by the President himself. 
The Senator from New Mexico has introduced this budget in this form to indicate precisely what the real world consequences of a failure to reform entitlement spending will be. 
In addition, in order to end or to mute the debate with the President over whether the President's far more rosy projections of our economy are correct as against those of the Congressional Budget Office, the proposal of the Senator from New Mexico says if, in fact, the economy operates in a better fashion than is projected by the Congressional Budget Office, half of those additional revenues will be devoted to tax relief and half to reducing the cuts in domestic discretionary spending. In other words, instead of the policies proposed by the President, which is `spend now and then cut everything to ribbons if my projections don't work out,' this proposal says, `take the more conservative projections now and spend and provide tax relief in the future if the President's projections show themselves to be correct in whole or in part.' 
The chairman of the Budget Committee did not present this proposal as his preferred budget, nor is it mine, nor is it, I am sure, that of the distinguished Presiding Officer at this point. It is simply what we are likely to be forced to do if we cannot agree on significant reform in the entitlement programs which are growing both so rapidly as to crowd out all other spending and all tax relief, but also so rapidly as to threaten their own very existence. 
What the Senator from New Mexico would prefer, what this Senator would prefer, would be an engagement, a budget resolution reflecting a strong bipartisan consensus in this body and the strong enthusiastic support and recommendations of the 
President of the United States himself that will require us to deal with entitlements. It will require us to look into the accuracy, or lack of accuracy, in the Consumer Price Index, because it is only if we have a more equitably distributed budget that we can provide for tax relief and for necessary discretionary spending programs. Only then we can have a conversation with the President and between the two parties on exactly what tax relief should be granted to the American people and where additional discretionary funds may be spent. 
As I began these remarks, there was on the floor the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, and there is now my friend from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. Each of them was a leader, one a Republican and one a Democrat, in a bipartisan budget proposal which was presented to this body almost a year ago on this floor. It courageously dealt with each one of these issues, dealt with them in a balanced fashion and dealt with them in a way that decisively would have brought the budget into balance by the year 2002. 
One of the curious elements of that budget, I may say, Mr. President, and I am sure my friend from North Dakota agrees with me, was that we hear today numerous favorable comments about it from those who did not vote for it. In fact, if we could try it again and put ourselves back into April of last year, it looks like it might have gotten 70 votes rather than 46. 
In any event, that time is past, that time is lost and because we lost it, the challenges we face are even more difficult today. But I know that my friend from New Mexico, who has now returned to the floor, means the introduction of these two alternatives to be a trigger toward an agreement with the President and with many members of the Democratic Party on a budget that will realistically reach balance by the year 2002 which will give needed tax relief to the American people, tax relief that they deserve, that will allow us sufficient money for the important discretionary programs of this Government, whether they are the building of an infrastructure or for education or for environmental purposes, and that will not only reform entitlement programs so that these other goals can be reached, but will reform them so that they are themselves secure and financially sound for the future, and so that what we do reflects the real world and not an artificial set of statistics. 
So I came to the floor this evening, Mr. President, to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his thoughtfulness and his tremendous amount of work for the two resolutions that he has submitted, 
and to simply try to emphasize that with him I hope not that either of these proposals passes and becomes a guideline for the U.S. Senate and for the Congress, but that they help us reach a goal that is not a Republican goal, not a Democratic goal, but a goal for all Americans.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, agriculture is a cornerstone of Washington State's economy. Washington State farmers produce over $5.8 billion worth of agriculture products, employ more that 100,000 people, and export nearly a quarter of all their goods to international markets. Without a doubt, Agriculture is Washington's No. 1 industry. 
As I travel around the State I have listened closely to the comments, suggestions, and concerns of our State's agriculture community. Farmers and ranchers in Washington have without exception told me they want a smaller and less intrusive Government; a Government that lets farmers, ranchers, and local communities make decisions for themselves; and most importantly, a Government that will step up to the plate and fight for issues that affect their lives. As Washington's senior Senator, I plan to work for just that. 
The web of Federal practices, laws and regulations governing agriculture in the United States should offer our farmers consistency, flexibility and market access for their goods. Farmers view the Federal Government, like the weather and seasons, as an outside force to be dealt with. I want to ensure that the Federal Government is a partner with agriculture, instead of an east-coast overseer. 
This year, the wheat, barley, canola, pea and lentil, potato, hops, sweet cherry, and apple associations, as well as countless other growers' organizations, have visited me in Washington, DC. From our discussions, I have compiled a list of broad agriculture priorities on which I will focus in the 105th Congress. 
I have always had, and will retain, open channels of communication with my State's agriculture communities. Firsthand knowledge of the situations and problems that farmers and growers face is, for me, an invaluable tool as I work on issues that impact their way of life. So, I intend to meet with farmers, ranchers, irrigators, processors, shippers, and other agricultural interests during the April recess to discuss these matters. 
For 3 days I will tour eastern Washington to discuss private property rights, tax reform, salmon recovery issues, agriculture research, transportation issues, the Endangered Species Act, trade policies, regulatory relief, the future of the Hanford reach and the reform of immigration policies important to the agricultural communities throughout Washington State. 
During my visits to Yakima, Spokane, and the tri-cities, I will discuss my top 10 priorities for agriculture, refine them, and solicit feedback from the various agriculture interests that are affected by a wide range of intrusive Federal policies. My visit to eastern Washington will give me the opportunity to continue discussions already begun with Washington State's farmers, explain my intentions, and reaffirm my commitment to the agriculture community. 
To reiterate, the agriculture community's interests are Washington State's interests--Washington's economic health and job base are greatly affected by the success or failure in this sector of our economy. I will therefore pursue my 10 priorities, which I believe will help build a stronger future for Washington State. 
Two years ago agriculture communities in eastern Washington gave me the opportunity to work for them, represent their interests, and fight against policies that threaten their livelihood. As their Senator, I will be working aggressively to promote their interests in the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I take this occasion to thank my friend and colleague from Hawaii who has been here longer than I have and has waited patiently for recognition, allowing my short remarks to precede his longer ones. He is a kind and thoughtful gentlemen.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, would it be appropriate to say, I ask my friend from Kentucky, that at the present time under the first amendment the American people are free to participate in their political system and in public affairs pretty much in any way they wish, that their freedom of speech is entirely unlimited? 
And would it be fair also to say that the thrust of this constitutional amendment is that its sponsors are asking the American people to give the Congress of the United States the right to devise, to knit together a gag which is then to be applied to the American people themselves, not just candidates but to any American who wishes to express his views about a candidate, any organization that wishes to express its views about a candidate, for that matter, any newspaper or television station that wishes to express its view about a candidate; that this constitutional amendment says that what has been entirely free, an entirely free process, we now ask that you allow us to impose whatever we consider to be a reasonable gag upon your exercise of that right?

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senate Joint Resolution 18 almost certainly represents the most serious and fundamental attack on first amendment rights of free speech in the 210-year history of that first amendment. 
Senate Joint Resolution 18 is not aimed at the entire ambit of 
free speech rights. It in no way grants Congress authority over obscenity, over beer advertising, over fine arts. It is focused solely on allowing the Congress sweeping authority over the freedom of political speech, not just of politicians but of all citizens and of the news media that serve those citizens. 
The first Congress of the United States responded to the most serious objection to the ratification of our Constitution that was presented during those ratification debates--the absence of a bill of rights and, most particularly, the absence of a constitutional guarantee of free speech. 
When James Madison and his colleagues drafted the first amendment and worked on its protection of free speech, they were not concerned, Mr. President, about defending obscenity. They were not concerned with limitations on beer advertising. They were not concerned with playwrights. They were concerned with debate over the political future of the people of the United States of America. 
They believed, as did almost all of the citizens who worried about a new Constitution, that the new Government might, like its British predecessors, attempt to gag newspapers and individuals in their pursuit of a free and open debate over matters political. So they wrote a first amendment that was unconditional in that respect. They wrote a first amendment that said, `Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . .' They did not write, as this resolution would, in paraphrase, `Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech except such restrictions as Congress may deem reasonable.' 
Mr. President, you and I and all the other Members of this body and every American who has ever run for office recognizes that, other than that vitally important meeting of people as individuals on a one-to-one basis, doorbelling, canvassing, and the like, important even to those of us who run for the U.S. Senate but obviously an impossible tactic when one represents hundreds of thousands or millions of voters, that there are fundamentally four ways in which we can communicate political ideas in the course of the campaign to the people who are constituents or whom we seek to represent. 
The first of those, Mr. President, is through our own campaign committees. `Gorton '94,' `McConnell '96,' `Hollings '98,' formally organized and set up, receiving campaign contributions, writing advertisements, scheduling the candidates, doing so in a fairly transparent fashion. That is the first one. 
The second way which our ideas can be communicated to those whom we seek to represent is through the party organizations with which we are affiliated. All candidates for Federal office are members of organized political parties. Most candidates for State office and many for local office are as well. In fact, in almost every State the only identifier on the ballot in addition to the name of the candidate is the political party that candidate identifies with. So the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, and the Socialist Worker Party also, involves itself in campaigns communicating en mass in the ways that they consider to be most effective with the voters. 
The third way of communicating political ideas, Mr. President, is by the independent activity of individuals or organizations who are not, under most circumstances, directly connected with either the candidate or with any political party but who have a vital interest, on behalf of themselves as individuals or as members of organizations in which they are a part in the political future of the country, in who is elected to particular offices. 
As I say, they may be individuals, they may be very wealthy individuals, they may be organizations from one end of the political spectrum to another, but they communicate quite freely and without any censorship from Congress their ideas about political elections, their support for candidates, their opposition to candidates. 
Finally, the fourth way in which political ideas about elections get to the voters is through our mass media--through radio, television and the newspapers--many of which are vitally interested in these ideas, many of which literally editorialize and endorse, but even when they don't, they communicate such ideas as they deem relevant in explaining the positions of the various candidates. 
Senate Joint Resolution 18 is, I must say, philosophically consistent and intellectually honest in that it permits Congress to regulate all four of those activities. It allows Congress to put reasonable limits on contributions or expenditures by, in support of, or in opposition to candidates for Federal office. That covers the candidates' committees, that covers the political parties, that covers the totally independent individuals and groups, and that covers the newspapers and television stations and radio stations that participate in these political campaigns. 
I say, Mr. President, that this proposal is philosophically consistent and logical and principled in making no real distinction among those four methods of contribution, because, of course, the present campaign law does not. The law under which we operate today puts very real limits on candidates' campaign organizations, limits which, by the operation of inflation, have grown smaller in each successive election cycle on contributions from organizations or from individuals to those candidates, significant disclosure requirements on the source of those contributions, so significant that on many occasions, it would seem that our newspapers spend more time and more column inches reporting contributions than they do on reporting ideas. 
The 1974 law imposes some, but vaguer, restrictions on contributions to and expenditures by political parties. It was unable, as a matter of constitutional law, to impose any significant restrictions on independent expenditures, and it made no attempt to impose any restrictions on the news media, recognizing even then the unconstitutionality of doing so. 
What has been the net impact of the set of restrictions that we have today? In almost direct ratio to the restrictions on the amount of money that individuals and organizations can contribute to candidates, it has caused those individuals and organizations, when they feel passionately about a candidate, either for or against, to funnel their contributions to the political parties whom they know would support those candidates. And so we have the challenge of soft money today, largely because those who contribute soft money to political parties cannot contribute that money in hard form to the candidates themselves. 
This, all by itself, has made political campaigns less satisfactory and candidates less responsible. Each of us as a candidate is responsible directly for the way in which he or she conducts his or her campaign. When our name is on the disclaimer of a television ad, we cannot disown it. When we have reported a contribution from an individual or a group, we cannot disown it. But even when that advertisement or that political activity comes from our political party, we can, to a certain extent, disassociate ourselves from the ideas or the messages involved. We may very well, we hope, benefit from it when they support us, but we cannot guarantee that we will gain such a benefit. 
Now we have waiting in the wings, subject to validation only, I believe, if we adopt this constitutional amendment, a set of similar restrictions on political parties. If we adopt such a system of restrictions on political parties, Mr. President, it seems to me we know clearly what will happen, because it is already happening. Those same groups, those same individuals who feel passionately about Federal elections today and who are barred from providing the support they want to provide to the candidate directly, are barred from providing that support to the candidate's political party, will simply do it on their own. 
Last Sunday's Washington Post had an interesting article about the 1996 campaigns, the headline of which is: `For Their Targets, Mystery Groups' Ads Hit Like Attacks From Nowhere.' The airwaves were filled with this kind of activity at the end of 1996--organizations with fictional names engaged mostly in negative advertising against particular candidates, the source of support for which was unknown and, therefore, the responsibility for the content of which was unknown. But as long as we have a Congress that impinges on every aspect of our social and individual and economic lives, we will have individuals who wish to participate and will participate in that fashion if they are not allowed to participate more directly and more openly. 
So Senate Joint Resolution 18 very clearly will allow Congress to put limits on that kind of political participation. So it will say, in the ultimate analysis, we can do whatever we think is reasonable to shut people up when it comes to political debates. 
Now, that still leaves the fourth element of communication: the radio, television stations, and the newspapers of this country. Very likely, the first bill that went through Congress after this constitutional amendment passed would not affect them, but they would sure be in clover, Mr. President, because then, with the candidate and the candidate's supporters and the candidate's proponents all muzzled, the only source of information would be the mass news media. 
But now this passionately devoted and wealthy individual or this passionately devoted organization would soon find the answer to that question: Buy a newspaper; buy a television station. Then you are entirely free to spend all the money you want on political communication, totally divorced from any responsibility on the part of the candidate at all. 
So the next law, Mr. President, will limit what the newspapers and the television stations and radio stations can do.

Mr. GORTON. Congress, if this should be part of the Constitution, might well make just such a decision on the relatively rational grounds that all political speech they want to be directly attributable to candidates and not to permit anyone to engage in a partisan political debate except through the candidate's committees. 
Now, I must say to my friend from Kentucky, I doubt that would happen in the Congress immediately after the adoption of a constitutional amendment like this. The sponsors of this constitutional amendment are all supporters of the McCain-Feingold proposal, and my inclination is that they would be content with the passage of that legislation with this constitutional provision in effect. 
They know, or at least the most thoughtful and principled of them know, that McCain-Feingold is blatantly unconstitutional under the first amendment as the first amendment exists today. I rather imagine they would be satisfied with this reform as their predecessors were satisfied with the 1974 reforms. As soon as this reform showed itself to be as ineffective as 1974 has, as soon as it had pushed communication into another channel, they would be back to close off that channel. 
At the present time, their frustration stems almost entirely from the fact that they are only permitted to dam one channel of the river, and all the water just goes around the other side of the island and flows into the political system to the same extent or to a greater extent than it does at the present time. This constitutional amendment allows them to dam the whole river for good and permanently. 
It is for exactly that reason that I say, Mr. President, this is certainly the most fundamental attack on the most fundamental of American freedoms that has taken place in this body in the 14-plus years during which I have served and, I think, probably in the 210 years since the first amendment was adopted by the first Congress.

Mr. GORTON. Congress would certainly have the authority to 
pass just such a law, I say, Mr. President, to my friend from Kentucky. I think as a former State attorney general, he has argued a number of cases in the Supreme Court. I would probably be willing to take that challenge on a reasonable basis to the Supreme Court of the United States, and I might well win at that $50,000 figure. 
But the vice of this constitutional amendment is that I would have to do that in the first place, and there would be an argument that that was a reasonable limitation. When we start down this road, we put the right of free speech and political matters of the people of the United States into the hands of Congress. 
As the Senator from New Mexico said earlier, each of us believes sufficiently in this system to hold the opinion that most of the time we do the right thing and that almost all of the time we try to do the right thing. We are probably least likely to do the right thing when it affects our own individual fates and our own individual careers. Even when we are, we sometimes, at least, can make mistakes. That, I must say, is obviously the reason that Madison and the first Congress wrote the first amendment in unequivocal terms with a primary focus on political speech. They simply did not wish to give this authority to Congress, and they were right. 
The Supreme Court of the United States, in dealing with the 1974 law in Buckley versus Valeo, I think put the issue in the simplest and clearest fashion when it says, 
In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is not the Government, but the people individually as citizens and candidates, and collectively as associations and political committees, who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
That is the central issue here. Is this a matter that is up to the judgment of the people as individuals and as members of organizations? Or is it up to the Government--in this case a self-interested Government--to say what is reasonable? You and I, Mr. President, and the Senator from Kentucky and I believe that this is a matter for people as individuals and as members of voluntary associations. The proponents of this constitutional amendment believe this is a matter for the Government. Between us, there is a great gulf fixed which cannot be bridged. We stand on the Constitution as it was written by the Founding Fathers. We stand on a faith in the people, and we reject the interference of the Federal Government on this question.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted to confirm Federico PenAE6a to be Secretary of Energy. As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I have met with Secretary PenAE6a and discussed issues of importance to Washington State, the Northwest, and the Nation. I understand that some Senators had reservations about Secretary PenAE6a because he does not have a great deal of experience on energy related issues. I do not hold this same reservation. I do not necessarily view Secretary PenAE6a's lack of expertise on energy issues as a liability, but rather as an opportunity to educate the new Secretary on issues important to the people of Washington State and the region. 
Two issues immediately come to mind--Hanford and electricity deregulation. 
I look forward to working with Secretary PenAE6a on the many challenges facing the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the southeastern part of my State. While there are many difficult issues facing Hanford, there are also many exciting opportunities. 
One of these opportunities is the Fast Flux Test Facility [FFTF]. FFTF is a valuable asset for our national security interests and a potential cure for diseases and other medical conditions. Scientists believe FFTF can begin producing tritium--an essential part of our nuclear deterrent--within 5 years. Moreover, nearly 70 of our Nation's leading medical researchers have validated claims that FFTF is essential to the production of medical isotopes which could one day be a valuable weapon in the fight against cancer. 
FFTF is by no means the only important issue that Secretary PenAE6a will face at Hanford in his new position. In addition, I look forward to working with him on maintaining an adequate budget to meet the site's cleanup mission. 
It's no secret that Hanford has been one of the most contaminated sites owned by the Federal Government. Despite the enormity of the cleanup, I believe we are making real progress due in large part to the extraordinary efforts and talents of the people who work at the site and make up the surrounding Hanford communities. 
The DOE, in coordination with Congress, is also playing an important role prioritizing, streamlining, and increasing efficiency at Hanford, I look foward to continuing my already strong working relationship with Secretary PenAE6a in his new role to preserve continuity in funding at Hanford and other DOE sites. 
On the subject of electricity deregulation, it is critical that Secretary PenAE6a listen and work closely with the Northwest congressional delegation on electricity issues unique to the Northwest. The Northwest has its own peculiar set of challenges--namely the ability of the Bonneville Power Administration to market its power while paying nearly $500 million in annual fish and wildlife costs. Secretary PenAE6a and I have discussed these issues and he has committed to work with the Northwest members of the Senate Energy Committee on these difficult Northwest issues. I intend to take Secretary PenAE6a up on his offer, and hope that together with my Northwest colleagues that we can work on these issues critical to Northwest ratepayers, an the environment.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to voice my strong support for the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative. Ambassador Barshefsky has done an outstanding job as acting USTR since her appointment last April. 
I believe Ambassador Barshefsky is one of the best nominations President Clinton has made and am honored to have the opportunity to speak on her behalf. Charlene Barshefsky is an aggressive and articulate advocate of U.S. trade interests and has been very successful in defending U.S. business and agriculture throughout the world. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is vital to opening up trade markets to U.S. goods, and Charlene Barshefsky has proven herself to be very effective at doing just that. 
Ambassador Barshefsky understands that U.S. agriculture and industry can compete very effectively in the international market, but only if trade barriers are torn down. She has been relentless in her efforts to expand market access for U.S. exports and to promote U.S. trade interests abroad. 
I am particularly impressed with Ambassador Barshefsky's work on intellectual property rights. My State is home to the Nation's largest software producer and to many smaller software and video game companies. These businesses have faced devastating problems with the counterfeiting of their products overseas. Ambassador Barshefsky has been a leader in the fight to end such violations of U.S. intellectual property rights. Last year, she negotiated a tough deal with China. By threatening sanctions against $2 billion in Chinese exports to the United States, she was successful in forcing Beijing to crackdown on software counterfeiters. While intellectual property theft still occurs, Ambassador Barshefsky has made great strides in defending United States interests in Asia. 
She has also worked as a tough negotiator on Pacific Northwest wheat exports to China. As many of my colleagues know, China has, for the past 25 years, imposed arbitrary restrictions on the importation of wheat from the United States. The Chinese Government claims that Washington State wheat is infected by TCK Smut disease and therefore forbids its import into China for fear that the disease will spread to Chinese wheat. Unfortunately, their claim has no scientific basis. Ambassador Barshefsky has worked diligently to eliminate trade restrictions based on unsound science. Although her efforts have not yet been successful, she has been the strongest voice Washington state wheat growers have had in the administration for several years. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Charlene Barshefsky, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her as U.S. Trade Representative. 
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will authorize a settlement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District in Washington State. I introduced similar legislation last year. Congressman Doc Hastings has introduced legislation on this subject in the House of Representatives, and the House Resources Committee will mark up the legislation today. 
This legislation will authorize a carefully negotiated settlement between the BOR and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District. If enacted, this legislation will save the BOR, and therefore the Nation's taxpayers, money that would otherwise be spent fighting with the irrigation district in court. 
Earlier this week the administration sent a letter to me indicating that it would support the settlement bill, provided that several changes be made to the legislation. The legislation that I introduce today includes the changes requested by the administration. At this time, I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the administration's letter of support for the legislation in the Record.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the economic arguments for this constitutional amendment were eloquently stated--lower interest rates, more jobs, and a higher standard of living for Americans in the future. 
I want to emphasize that the moral arguments favor this constitutional amendment. Mr. President, it is simply morally wrong for us, year after year after year, to consume the services of government and to send the bills to our children and to our grandchildren, who have not had a voice in this body. We must be responsible enough to see to it that what we want from government today we pay for today. The fact is that we will not do it without a constitutional amendment, as evidenced by the heavy stack of unbalanced budgets in front of the leader of the debate on this issue. 
This balanced budget is for our children and our grandchildren.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Hatch today in introducing the Software Export Equality Act. In 1971, Congress created foreign service corporations [FSC] in order to encourage U.S. exports and increase U.S. competitiveness in the international marketplace. Under current law, FSC legislation gives U.S. manufacturers a tax incentive for exports of domestically produced goods. Today, virtually every U.S. product manufactured for export abroad qualifies for FSC benefits. Yet current tax laws continue to discriminate against one of the America's fastest growing exports: software. 
Due to the IRS's narrow interpretation of FSC rules, the software industry is precluded from qualifying for any FSC benefits despite the fact that approximately 85 percent of products sold by U.S. software companies are developed in the United States and it currently ranks seventh in U.S. industry exports. This bill will clarify that computer software qualifies as export property and is eligible for FSC benefits. Continuing to deny the benefits of FSC rules to the software industry is not only unfair, it poses a serious impediment to the competitiveness of U.S. manufactured software. 
Software is one of the America's fastest growing industries, with revenues of more than $200 billion and a growth rate of 13 percent per year on average. As the world leader in software development, the United States is home to more than 8,000 software companies that provide, directly and indirectly, millions of high-paying, high-skilled American jobs in many States. 
Software is a vital and growing part of many State economies, including my own State of Washington. In Washington State, the software industry accounted for $3.5 billion worth, and 12 percent, of Washington State exports and employed over 22,509 people in 1995. Microsoft, the State's largest software producer, alone supported 1.5 percent of the State's economy in 1995. But these impressive numbers do not even take into account the significant impact the numerous small and middle-sized software companies that make up the majority in Washington State have on the State's economy. 
The worldwide market for software is exploding and global competition is quickly on the rise. In this increasingly competitive world economy, incentives to encourage firms to develop and export from the United States are more important than ever to job creation and economic stability. This bill provides a simpe way to ensure the U.S. software industry remains the world leader in software manufacturing and American software jobs are protected. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this very important legislation and urge its quick passage in the Senate.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am proud today to honor the retirement of the Navy's A-6E Intruder. Attack Squadron 196 at Whidbey Naval Air Station in my home State and Attack Squadron 75 in Virginia Beach will stand down the final two Intruder squadrons in simultaneous ceremonies today. 
As the backbone of carrier attack aviation for the past 36 years, the A-6E Intruder stood ready to face the enemy in any weather, day or night. The A-6 put teeth in the term `carrier forward presence.' It saw combat in Vietnam, Lebanon, Libya, in the waters of the Arabian Gulf and over the shores of Kuwait and Iraq. It delivered iron bombs, laser guided bombs, and every air-to-ground missile available in the Navy inventory for the past three decades. The A-6E Intruder was the hardest working plane on the flight deck. 
The pilots and bombardier/navigators who flew the Intruder had great affection and respect for the aircraft and its ability to withstand heavy enemy fire. They too should be honored for their courage and dedication to this great nation. They will truly miss the A-6. 
We also honor the thousands of Intruder maintainers, both past and present, who kept the A-6E flying day and night, at sea and ashore. The excellent record of the Intruder is a testament to the hard work of these men and women. 
Finally, let us remember the Intruder crews who never returned. In service to our Nation, they paid the ultimate price flying this machine that they loved. We must never forget them. From this day on, the United States Navy must continue to carry on the spirit of Intruder attack. 
On a personal basis, my son-in-law, Joe Nortz, was an A-6 bombardier/navigator during most of his 20-year Navy career. He is attending the stand down ceremony at NAS Whidbey as a great admirer of a great aircraft.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined my colleagues in supporting final passage of H.R. 668, an urgently needed measure to reimpose the aviation excise taxes through the end of fiscal year 1997, and give the Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer previously collected aviation excise taxes into the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. 
Reinstatement of these excise taxes for fiscal year 1997 are essential to the continued operation of our Federal aviation system. The Airport and Airway Trust Fund into which these taxes are deposited, is funded by a 10-percent passenger ticket tax; a 6.25-percent cargo waybill tax; a $6.00 per person international departure tax; and certain general aviation fuel taxes. In 1997, this trust fund is expected to provide 62 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's [FAA] fiscal year 1997 budget. More specifically, the trust fund is expected to provide $5.3 billion of the FAA's $8.6 billion total fiscal year 1997 budget. Of this $5.3 billion, $3.6 billion will provide 100 percent of the resources necessary to fund the FAA's capital programs, while $1.7 billion will provide 34 percent of the fiscal year 1997 budget for FAA operations. 
When the authority to collect the aviation excise taxes lapsed on December 31, 1996, officials from both the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the FAA initially predicted that the $4.35 billion in uncommitted balances in the fund at that time would be available to fund the FAA's capital programs through June 30, 1997. If Congress did not reinstate the taxes by July 1, 1997, they predicted, the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] would have to reduce the FAA's capital accounts, which are totally funded out of the trust fund--including both the facilities and equipment [F&E] account and Airport Improvement Program, to account for the $1 billion shortfall between the trust fund's fiscal year 1997 expected contribution of $5.3 and the actual contribution of $4.35. 
According to the FAA, this reduction in the facilities and equipment account could force the FAA to issue stop work orders on all major F&E contracts, which include upgrades of the current air traffic control system throughout the country. The Airport Improvement Program would suffer an even greater impact. Under the original projections, if the aviation taxes were not reinstated, funding for the airport improvement would have to be reduced by as much as $300 million in fiscal year 1997. Existing funding agreements under the AIP would be maintained, but no new, discretionary funding would be provided for high priority safety and security projects, capacity projects, and important noise mitigation programs. 
From a Washington State perspective, fiscal year 1997 funding for noise mitigation is particularly important. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been a national leader in noise mitigation programs and was the first to implement a local housing insulation program to reduce the impact on houses near the airport. The current program, which is partially funded through the AIP's discretionary noise mitigation grants, is scheduled to run through the year 2003. 
Under the FAA and GAO's original projections, it was clear that reinstating the taxes as quickly as possible was the appropriate action for Congress to take to ensure that the U.S. aviation system continues to be the best system in the world. The need to do this became even more urgent in mid-January, however, when the Treasury Department announced that because of an accounting error, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund could be insolvent as early as March or April. 
Let me explain the events, as I understand them, which led to accounting error made at by the Treasury Department. Each airline deposits the ticket taxes it collects to the IRS every 2 weeks. Under the look-back provisions of the IRS safe harbor rule, however, an airline can base the amount of that payment on the amount of excise taxes it collected in a 2-week period from the second preceding quarter before the current quarter. In other words, in making a 2-week tax payment in the third quarter of the year, an airline can deposit the amount it collected in a 2-week period during the first quarter of that year. If the taxes it deposits are less than what the airline actually took in during the third quarter, the airline can make up that underpayment when it files its quarterly return. The quarterly return date is approximately 2 months after the close of the quarter. 
The 10-percent ticket tax was in place during the fourth quarter of 1996. The airlines semimonthly tax payments for that quarter, however, were based on the second quarter of 1996, during which time no excise taxes were collected. The airlines, in essence, did not remit any excise taxes during the fourth quarter of 1996, even though they were collecting these taxes from passengers at that time. The airlines had to make up for these tax underpayments by the time they file their fourth quarter returns, which are due today. Without this legislation, however, these taxes would not be deposited into the aviation trust fund, since the general-fund-to-trust-fund transfer authority expired along with the aviation excise taxes on December 31, 1996. 
It appears that the Treasury Department did not account for the complex accounting procedures, and assumed that the trust fund would be credited with $1.5 billion more than it could have been, unless Congress reinstated the authority for the IRS to transfer the fourth quarter excise taxes to the trust fund. 
Last night, the Senate passed the bill that will avert the imminent insolvency of the trust fund and ensure that our aviation system remains the best and safest in the world. The temporary reinstatement of the excise taxes, however, does not necessarily mean that the taxes should be extended indefinitely. Last year, Congress created the National Civil Aviation Review Commission [NCARC] to study new mechanisms to fund the FAA after an indepedent audit of FAA needs. The report on the independent audit of the FAA's projected needs was released today, February 28, and now the NCARC can do its work and report back to Congress in early October 1997. While I would have preferred to maintain the aviation taxes through the end of the year to ensure that there was not another lapse while Congress thoroughly considers the NCARC recommendations, procedural and time contraints made it impossible to do this.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the long and often thoughtful debate over the balanced budget amendment is now drawing to a close. It is also apparently drawing to a regrettable unsuccessful end unless a sudden flash of enlightenment takes over the minds and hearts of one or more of the opponents to this amendment. 
Nevertheless, I believe it appropriate for every Member of this body to state his or her reasons for support or for opposition to the amendment. While I have done so in part, at least in the past, I should like to share with my colleagues some of my thoughts on the subject. 
Mr. President, from my perspective, perhaps the single most important reason for voting in favor of this constitutional amendment, for including a requirement making it considerably more difficult to spend money that we do not have, is a moral or ethical one. 
Mr. President, we living today, representing the people of our States today, simply do not have the right to spend money to undertake obligations which we collectively are unwilling to pay for, thereby consuming whatever goods or services Government provides to us today and sending the bills to our children and to our grandchildren. Mr. President, that is simply the wrong thing to do. We should not engage in that practice at all, and it is a simple disgrace that we have now engaged in it in each and every year for almost three decades. 
Now, I am aware of, and I subscribe to, the positive economic impacts of balancing our budget. It is clear to me, as it is to most, that it will mean lower interest rates which, in turn, make it easier for young people--for all of our people--to purchase a home, an automobile, a college or university education. At the same time, a balanced budget provides more economic growth and, thus, greater opportunities, again, for all of us, but particularly for generations just moving into the work force. These are important arguments. These are goals that we all ought to see. But I believe that the balanced budget amendment would be imperative even if we were not able to prove in our own minds the economic benefits of the amendment. For the reasons that I have just stated, it is wrong for us to spend the debt and to send the bills to those who are not represented here, who, Mr. President, in most cases, have not yet been born. 
In this long and leisurely and thoughtful debate, we have been given dozens of reasons not to pass the amendment. Dozens of scarecrows have been raised: We can't respond to a military emergency that does not involve a declaration of war. We can't respond to a physical disaster. We can't build our infrastructure. Social Security, or some other program, may be hurt by a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, first, as someone interested in the history of our country, I am reminded by the recitation of these objections to nothing so much as the case against adopting the Constitution in the first place in 1787 and 1788. These arguments stem, just as did those arguments more than two centuries ago, from a fear of the unknown. But, Mr. President, those fears must be weighed against the actual, tangible history of the last half century. And that actual, tangible history shows us that, regrettably, we do not, without some constitutional constraints, balance our budget. In fact, in my mind, each one of those threats is more likely to become reality if we don't balance the budget than if we do. 
A balanced budget will provide a far stronger economy for the support of Social Security, a far stronger framework for the building of our infrastructure, and a far stronger structure within which we can provide for the education for our young people than does the present system, which threatens all of these things by the accumulated burden of the debt, added to each year by the amount of its annual deficit. So the very threats that are causing Members to vote against this constitutional amendment are more likely to come true if they are successful than if they are not. 
Mr. President, this may well be the most important single vote that we cast during the course of this Congress. It is our duty, whether the constitutional amendment passes or not, to produce for the people of this country, for our colleagues, a budget which is balanced in fact. And it is clearly possible--though history gives very little cause for optimism--that we may do so in the absence of this amendment. At least this debate has led to lip service on the part of the President of the United States and almost every Member of this Congress to the proposition that we should do so. But to see to it that not only we do so, but that our successors do so, that we break the mold of the history of the last decades, the passage of this amendment is absolutely essential. 
I am pleased that all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle plan to vote in favor of the constitutional amendment. I hope that a sudden flash of enlightenment on the other side of the aisle will help us to get the necessary 67 votes. 
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last Thursday, I joined my colleague from Arizona, the new Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee--Senator McCain, the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Hollings, and the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, Senator Ford, in sponsoring the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act. This legislation will extend the existing system of aviation excise taxes through September 29, 1997, and give the Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer previously collected aviation excise taxes into the airport and airway trust fund. 
The airport and airway trust fund is funded by a 10-percent passenger ticket tax; a 6.25-percent cargo waybill tax; a $6 per person international departure tax; and certain general aviation fuel taxes. In 1997, this fund is expected to provide 62 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's [FAA] fiscal year 1997 budget. More specifically, the trust fund is expected to provide $5.3 billion of the FAA's $8.6 billion total fiscal year 1997 budget. Of this $5.3 billion, $3.6 billion will provide 100 percent of the resources necessary to fund the FAA's capital programs, while $1.7 billion will provide 34 percent of the fiscal year 1997 budget for FAA operations. But this fund, so critical to the operation and improvements of our aviation system, is no longer being funded. 
When the authority to collect the aviation excise taxes lapsed on December 31, 1996, officials from both the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the FAA predicted that the $4.35 billion in uncommitted balances in the fund at that time would be available to fund the FAA's capital programs through June 30, 1997. By July 1, 1997, however, they predicted that the trust fund would become insolvent. Accordingly, if Congress did not reinstate the taxes, it was predicted that the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] would have to reduce the FAA's capital accounts, which are totally funded out of the trust fund --including both the facilities and equipment [F&E] account and Airport Improvement Program, to account for the $1 billion shortfall between the trust fund's fiscal year 1997 expected contribution of $5.3 billion and the actual contribution of $4.35 billion. 
According to the FAA, this reduction in the facilities and equipment account could force the FAA to issue stop work orders on all major F&E contracts, which include upgrades of the current air traffic control system throughout the country. The Airport Improvement Program would suffer an even greater impact. Under the original projections, if the aviation taxes were not reinstated, funding for the Airport Improvement Program would have to be reduced by as much as $300 million in fiscal year 1997. Existing funding agreements under the AIP would be maintained, but no new, discretionary funding would be provided for high-priority safety and security projects, capacity projects, and important noise mitigation programs. 
Quite simply, this is unacceptable. If delays in the implementation of safety and security initiatives, as well as construction of capacity enhancement projects, are caused by lack of funds, then we in Congress will be responsible for weakening the safest aviation system in the world. 
From a Washington State perspective, fiscal year 1997 funding for noise mitigation is particularly important. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport has been a national leader in noise mitigation programs and was the first to implement a local housing insulation program to reduce the impact on houses near the airport. The current program, which is partially funded through the AIP's discretionary noise mitigation grants, is scheduled to run through the year 2003. 
Under these original projections, it was clear that reinstating the taxes as quickly as possible was the appropriate action for Congress to take to ensure that the U.S. aviation system continues to be the best system in the world. 
Last Wednesday afternoon, however, this situation became more dire when the Treasury Department announced that because of an accounting error, the airport and airway trust fund could be insolvent as early as March or April. 
Let me explain the events, as I understand them, which led to accounting Error made at by the Treasury Department. Each airline deposits the ticket taxes it collects to the IRS every 2 weeks. Under the look-back provisions of the IRS safe harbor rule, however, an airline can base the amount of that payment on the amount of excise taxes it collected in a 2-week period from the second preceding quarter before the current quarter. In other words, in making a 2-week tax payment in the third quarter of the year, an airline can deposit the amount it collected in a 2-week period during the first quarter of that year. If the taxes it deposits are less than what the airline actually took in during the third quarter, the airline can make up that underpayment when it files its quarterly return. The quarterly return date is approximately 2 months after the close of the quarter. 
The 10 percent ticket tax was in place during the fourth quarter of 1996. The airlines' semimonthly tax payments for that quarter, however, were based on the second quarter of 1996, during which time no excise taxes were collected. The airlines, in essence, did not remit any excise taxes during the fourth quarter of 1996, even though they were collecting these taxes from passengers at that time. The airlines will have to make up for these tax underpayments by the time they file their fourth quarter returns, which are due on February 28, 1997. These taxes, however, will not be deposited into the aviation trust fund, since the general-fund-to-trust-fund transfer authority expired along with the aviation excise taxes on December 31, 1996. 
It appears that the Treasury Department did not account for the complex accounting procedures, and assumed that the trust fund would be credited with $1.5 billion more than it can be unless Congress reinstates the authority for the IRS to transfer the fourth quarter excise taxes to the trust fund. The FAA now expects to run out of money for its capital programs, and possibly its operations, much sooner than originally anticipated. 
Mr. President, with Wednesday's Treasury Department announcement that the trust fund could be insolvent by March, I believe it is clear that the Senate's first and overriding priority must be to immediately reinstate the excise tax and transfer authority. While our system continues to be the safest aviation system in the world, Congress owes it to the American people to consider this legislation as quickly as possible to ensure aviation safety, security, and capital investment are not jeopardized in any manner.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on January 1, 1997, the aviation system in the United States received a serious blow when the aviation excise taxes lapsed. Together, these taxes--the 10-percent passenger ticket tax; the 6.25-percent cargo waybill tax; the $6.00 per person international departure tax; and certain general aviation fuel taxes--account for more than 90 percent of the revenues in the airport and airway trust fund, which funds the Federal Aviation Administration and its programs. 
Without the collection of these revenues, the uncommitted balance of the airport and airway trust fund is quickly being depleted. In fact, it is running dry at a rate of $175 per second --more than $15 million every day. Yesterday, officials at the Department of the Treasury announced that if no action is taken to reimpose these taxes, the trust fund could be insolvent as early as March. 
For this reason, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators McCain, Hollings, and Ford, in sponsoring the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes Short Term Reinstatement Act. This legislation will extend the existing system of aviation excise taxes through September 29, 1997, and give Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer previously collected aviation excise taxes into the airport and airway trust fund. 
The numerous aviation tragedies in 1996 have, I believe, lowered the public's confidence in the safety of the U.S. aviation system. While our system continues to be the safest aviation system in the world, Congress owes it to the American people to consider this legislation as quickly as possible to ensure aviation safety, security, and capital investment are not jeopardized in any manner.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is to express my deep concern over a decision President Clinton made last year concerning the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, but it has only recently come to light. 
When President Clinton signed the antiterrorism bill into law on April 24 of last year he made a promise to the American people--a promise never to give in to terrorism or to terrorist forces. The President vowed to stand firm against nations that support terrorism and use violence and bloodshed for political ends. The President was right in his resolve. 
As the world's only superpower, the United States must set an example for all nations. We must not allow the cowards responsibility for such atrocities as the downing of Pan Am Flight 103, the bombing of the World Trade Center, or the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building to gain from their actions. 
That is why Congress included strict provisions in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 to isolate terrorist organizations and those who support them. Section 321 of the law prohibits U.S. businesses from engaging in any type of financial transactions with countries known to support international terrorism. This is an important weapon in our arsenal against terrorism that must be rigorously enforced. 
Doing business with state sponsors of terrorism provides such rogue nations with links to the outside world and means for financing their ugly agenda. Any such financial transaction may well return in the form of violence against the American people, our allies or other innocent victims. 
President Clinton purported to support this policy. In his address to the Nation on signing the antiterrorism bill, the President announced that America must resolve `to hold fast against the forces of violence and division * * * guard against them, speak against them and fight against them.' Unfortunately, the President has not lived up to his own words. 
As reported in the Washington Post last week, only 4 months after signing the antiterrorism bill, President Clinton made a special exemption in the law for Sudan, one of the seven nations classified by the Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism. The exemption was made specifically to allow California-based Occidental Petroleum Corporation to negotiate with the Sudanese Government for a stake in a $930 million oil deal. The President made this decision despite the State Department's finding that Sudan is second only to Iran in its sponsorship of Islamic extremists engaged in terrorism against United States allies in the Middle East and against the United States itself. 
Mr. President, I find these actions on the part of the President unconscionable, and I trust that most of my colleagues agree. This, unfortunately, is only the latest example of the flip-flopping on American foreign policy that marked the first term of President Clinton. Yet this particular change of heart may well be the most dangerous. The United States and our allies have known for decades that if we give terrorists an inch, they will take a mile. The more concessions we make, the more power we give to the forces of evil. It appears to me that our Commander in Chief engaged in the very practice he condemned in April. 
The American people should not stand for such deception. President Clinton has an obligation to every American ever hurt by terrorism and every American who may be threatened by terrorism in the future to do what he said he would--stand firm. I truly hope the President will do just that and reverse his exemption of Sudan from the list of nations barred from doing business with American firms. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, my friend Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, who is on the floor, and I and 51 other Senators have introduced today a bill on the alternative minimum tax as it is being unjustly and without precedent applied to farmers in all of our States and across the United States of America. 
In short, farmers are now being told that they must pay taxes on income that they have not received. 
I repeat that, Mr. President. Our farmers are now being told by the Internal Revenue Service that they are to pay taxes on income that they have not received when they have transferred ownership of their crops to some other entity but are not to receive payment for those crops until the next tax year. 
Mr. President, that is unprecedented. It is unjust. It is a terrible burden on many farmers who live under difficult circumstances and from hand to mouth. And it is not what Congress has intended in any of its amendments to the Internal Revenue Code. 
It is wrong, Mr. President. It was discovered or started initially, I regret to say, in the State of Washington last year aimed against a particular potato farmer. It has now spread like wildfire all across the country and it has become the policy of the Internal Revenue Service. 
A year ago, one Member of the House of Representatives from my State, George Nethercutt, introduced a bill on this without it being able to attain the attention that has been focused on it since that time. As I said, there are now 54 Members of this body who are sponsors of this bill to bring pure justice back to the administration of the Internal Revenue Code as it respects our farmers. 
I am convinced that as soon as we have a revenue bill from the House, which under the Constitution must deal with such a bill first, that we will pass this proposal almost unanimously. Mr. President, so far we have no revenue estimate on it. It was estimated last year to be minimal because of course these taxes will in fact be collected when the cash is received by the farmers. 
Farmers are not attempting through this bill to avoid a tax obligation. They are simply asking for the simple justice that that tax obligation not be imposed upon them until they have received the income on which the obligation is based. 
It is for that reason and under the leadership of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from North Dakota, who is here and whom I believe is next, that this bill is drafted, that we have made this proposal. We have now received the support of Mr. Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. 
I do not know of any reasonable opposition or, for that matter, any opposition at all to doing justice in this case. I am delighted we have such strong support for this bill. I urge not only action on this bill, Mr. President, but the promptest action possible for the Senate to remedy an injustice against our farmers.
