 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations to the former United States Ambassador to Spain, Richard N. Gardner who earlier this year received the Thomas Jefferson Award for his service during his tenure in Madrid. 
Since its inception in 1993, the Thomas Jefferson Award has been given annually by American Citizens Abroad to the State Department employee who has `done the most for American citizens overseas.' After consulting American clubs, Chambers of Commerce, and individual Americans around the world, American Citizens Abroad announced in Geneva that Richard Gardner was this year's recipient. The Ambassador was commended for his assistance to U.S. business, his establishment of twenty new scholarships for young Spaniards to study in the States, and for his frequent and informed articles in Spanish publications. 
Richard Gardner currently serves as the Henry L. Moses Professor of Law and International Organization at Columbia University Law School. He has spent a lifetime devoted to promoting international stability. He recognizes as only too few do the value of international law in the world.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate has done the right thing by agreeing to support David R. Kaczynski in his effort to donate more money to the victims of his brother, `Unabomber' Theodore J. Kaczynski. I hope the House of Representatives will now follow suit. This is a rare opportunity for Congress to write a happy ending to a sad story, and we should seize it. The U.S. Congress should not be in the business of discouraging acts of altruism. 
In August, Mr. Kaczynski and his wife, Linda E. Patrik, constituents of mine from Schenectady, New York, received a $1 million reward from the FBI for information leading to the 1996 arrest of Theodore Kaczynski. Immediately upon receiving the reward, David Kaczynski pledged that after payment of taxes and attorney's fees, all reward monies would go to the Unabomber's victims and their families. Mr. Kaczynski then contacted my office to ask whether Congress could provide, through legislation, that no tax be imposed so that a greater amount would be passed on to the victims. The uniquely compelling case for this measure was clear from the moment David Kaczynski first contacted me. I agreed and immediately introduced legislation, which was cosponsored by Senators D'Amato, Baucus and Burns. 
Since then, our legislation has received the support of others. Senators Roth, Hatch, Dodd, Lautenberg, and Moseley-Braun have all stated their strong support for the measure, and in the House, Congressman Mike NcNulty and Amo Houghton of New York, both Ways and Means Committee members, have introduced companion legislation. 
The Kaczynski family's decision was a wonderful, selfless act of humanity. Congress ought to applaud and support this fine example. It is good public policy to encourage reward recipients to donate those proceeds to the victims of violent crime. Without this legislation, federal taxes on the reward would total approximately $355,000. In other words, the Federal Treasury would get that money instead of the victims. It would be unjust for the Federal government to take that money when we have the power to pass it on to the victims. 
I thank Senators for supporting this important measure, and I urge its early enactment.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has confirmed Norman A. Mordue to the bench of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. 
Norman Mordue is a distinguished and competent jurist, having previously served as an assistant district attorney and county judge. He is now a New York Supreme Court justice. He is also a war hero. He earned this country's second highest military honor, the Distinguished Service Cross for Extraordinary Heroism, while serving as an infantry platoon leader with the 1st Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam. 
Judge Mordue has been active in many New York State Bar activities--he is a presiding officer in the Bar's judicial section and a continuing legal education lecturer--and he has been elected by his peers to head the Supreme Court Justices' Association. I have every confidence that he will make an excellent addition to the federal judiciary.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will confirm Denise O'Donnell to be the United States Attorney for the Western District of New York. She now becomes the first woman in the history of the 17-county Western District to be chief federal prosecutor. No woman before has ever had a presidential appointment in the district to one of the top three justice posts: judge, prosecutor or federal marshall. 
Ms. O'Donnell is a career Assistant U.S. Attorney. She came to the Western District in 1985 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and was named First Assistant in 1993. She has served as Interim U.S. Attorney since September 1997. In addition, she was a part-time instructor in the the Trial Technique Program at her alma mater, the State University of New York at Buffalo Law School. She graduated summa cum laude from that institution and was the senior editor of its law review. 
During her distinguished career as a prosecutor, Ms. O'Donnell has handled a host of complex criminal matters, including cases involving RICO, tax fraud, narcotics, and violent crimes. She is also an active participant in her local and state bar organizations and, last year was the Women Lawyers Association Lawyer of the Year. 
I am confident that Ms. O'Donnell will serve with the highest distinction.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree with the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee. I would also point out that both the funding for the Conservation Trust and the opportunity to provide much needed monies to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could have been accomplished by including the Administration's rum `cover over' proposal as part of the tax extenders package in the omnibus appropriations measure. 
The needs of Puerto Rico, and the importance of this provision, were magnified by the devastation recently caused by Hurricane Georges. Despite significant bipartisan support in the Senate and the House, and a strong push from the Administration, for some reason the House refused to include this provision in the bill. I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to work with him next year to address this issue.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the budget agreement reached on Thursday evening was celebrated by both parties in competing press conferences, and there may well be much to commend in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The trouble is, how would anyone know? 
According to a wire service report on Friday, the bill was `expected to be more than one foot thick.' In fact, it is closer to two feet thick, and contains some 4,000 pages. Will any Senator or Representative know what's in that monster bill when it is passed shortly--as is now inevitable? 
Of course not. Yet in recent years we are given to feel that even to ask such a question is to reveal an embarrassing naivete. 
Last year, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance, I was Floor Manager during Senate consideration of an 820-page bill somewhat unconvincingly entitled the `Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.' While it was pending before the Senate, the only copy of the bill present on the Senate floor was on the Democratic Manager's desk, having been obtained by our resourceful and learned Minority Chief Tax Counsel, Mr. Nick Giordano. A second copy provided to the majority Manager, Chairman Roth, had been lent to the Budget Committee so that it could be inspected for violations of assorted rules. 
During that debate, many Senators, having no other way to find out, came round to ask if I could ascertain whether this or that provision was in the bill. Sensing my opportunity, I would reply, `I could, but what will you pay me?' 
This year's legislation is no different; we continue to discover items that mysteriously found their way into--or out of--the text long after the agreement was announced. And so as we reflect on the successes and failures of the 105th Congress now ending, I rise simply to sound a note of caution, if not alarm. Having served here for 22 years now--I looked up at the beginning of this Congress to find myself 9th in seniority among Senate Democrats, and 14th in the Senate overall--I am troubled that of late we are getting ominously careless with our procedures. This growing neglect of our rules is becoming increasingly hurtful to the institution of the United States Congress. Surely it is not how business ought to be conducted in the national legislature of the United States of America. 
In an article yesterday headlined `Spending Deal Represents Failure, Not Success,' the distinguished Vice President and columnist for the Associated Press, Walter Mears, recalls that 
A decade ago, President Reagan confronted Congress with the `43 pounds of paper' it passed in 1987 to finance the government in one catchall bill after failing to enact separate appropriations. Reagan told the Democratic Congress not to pass any more `behemoths' like that, and said he wouldn't sign one again. 
`The budget process has broken down,' said Reagan, `It needs a drastic overhaul.' 
I do not assert that in some earlier, happier time, every Member of Congress read every word of every bill. That has never been possible. But only quite recently have the negotiations over, and contents of, our mammoth annual budget measures been kept secret from nearly everyone save the two Republican Leaders and the White House Chief of Staff. We are beginning to resemble a kind of bastard parliamentary system. Members loudly debate issues on the floor, but the real decisions are made in a closed room by three or four people. 
This deterioration in the process has taken place over about the last half decade, or so I would reason. Such things would never have been attempted, or tolerated, when I arrived here. That was a time when the rules and prerogatives of this institution were still revered. One shudders to think how the current state of affairs would be viewed by men of the House such as Thomas P. O'Neill or Dan Rostenkowski, or by giants of the Senate like Howard H. Baker or Russell B. Long. 
But the reality is that in recent years, a growing lack of respect for the institution of the Congress has begun to manifest itself in any number of damaging ways. To cite just a few other examples: 
The budget process has broken down. This year, for the first time in 24 years, Congress failed to pass a budget resolution. And we have had great difficulty passing reconciliation bills. In fact, the last proper, complete reconciliation bill we were able to enact was the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Since Thursday night we have been busily congratulating ourselves over completion of the latest budget--as if the simple act of keeping the government open is a unique achievement. 
Committees of Conference have been reduced to formalities. Meetings of conference committees are now rarely convened, and when they are, it is frequently done only to announce an outcome that has been predetermined--generally without participation by the minority. The appointment of conferees has sometimes been corrupted, with conference membership or party ratios within conferences subject to manipulation for partisan advantage. 
Even the `scope of the conference' requirement of Rule 28 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, which prohibited consideration by conference committees of provisions not in the bill passed by either house, has been overturned. On October 3, 1996, the Senate casually did away with that rule by a vote of 56-39. 
Likewise we no longer prohibit legislating on appropriations bills. This was a most useful rule that had existed since the adoption of the Standing Rules of the Senate in 1884; it helped prevent all manner of mischief in the annual appropriations process. 
Yet on March 16, 1995, during consideration of a bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense, we voted, in effect, to repeal the rule. An amendment was offered to impose a moratorium on listing of new endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Chair promptly sustained a point of order that the amendment violated 
the rule against legislation on appropriations bills. 
Without any thought given to the consequences, the ruling of the Chair was immediately appealed and then overturned, by a vote of 57-42. A new precedent had been set, and the rule was wiped out. Not one word was said on the floor, before or after the vote, about the terrible precedent we were creating. 
I voted against both of those changes to our rules. I found it astonishing on both occasions that the Senate would so blithely disregard its own procedures. 
The gigantic new Omnibus Appropriations Act, filled with hundreds of non-appropriations provisions never considered separately in either house, is the latest example of why those two little-noticed votes were big mistakes. Indeed, the distinction between appropriations measures and legislative changes is now so blurred that on Sunday, the House Appropriations Committee posted a press release on its website announcing `Significant Legislative Provisions in Appropriations Bills.' 
Parliamentary irregularities are creeping their way into acceptance. For instance, in several cases the Senate has, by unanimous consent, `deemed' bills passed before they are received from the House of Representatives. In 1997, a provision giving a $50 billion tax credit to the tobacco industry was slipped into a conference report after the conference committee had completed its work. (That provision was repealed soon after its existence was discovered.) 
In another case in 1998, the routine right to modify a floor amendment was used for a different purpose altogether: to undo a compromise agreement on assistance to tobacco farmers, and to defeat without a vote a bipartisan measure reported by the Committee on Finance. Also of concern is the now common practice of filing `motions to bring to a close debate' under Rule 22--cloture motions--on bills before a single word of debate has been uttered on the floor. 
This nonchalance about our procedures reached an extreme in 1995 and 1996 when we took up the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution and the Line Item Veto Act. These measures, which were part of Item One in the `Contract with America,' proposed to dramatically alter the procedures by which Congress, under Article I, Sections 7 and 8, of the Constitution, exercises the power of the purse. 
We had the good sense to defeat the Balanced Budget Amendment, albeit narrowly. However, the Line Item Veto Act passed the Senate by a vote of 69-31 on March 27, 1996--notwithstanding the pleas of this Senator and others that the bill was unconstitutional. Ultimately, of course, that Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 25, 1998 in the case of Clinton v. City of New York. But not before the Senator from New York, along with our revered leader Senator Byrd and Senators Levin and Hatfield, had to take the extraordinary step of becoming plaintiffs in one lawsuit, which was vacated due to lack of standing, and amici curiae in a second suit. Happily, as I say, we finally prevailed. 
In his powerful concurring opinion concluding that the Line Item Veto Act violated the separation of powers, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote that `Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to transgress the separation of powers.' Justice Kennedy went on to say this: `The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of the exercise of governmental power.' 
I repeat: `The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of the exercise of governmental power.' 
Surely this admonition applies to the regularity of the exercise of power in the United States Senate. We are not talking about mere technicalities or niceties to be observed or ignored at whim. The rules and procedures of the United States Congress matter. Just as the finely-wrought proscriptions in our Constitution matter. Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution provides that `Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. . .' Those rules are meant to be, and must be, obeyed. 
The Supreme Court held that the Line Item Veto Act threatened liberty by distorting the carefully designed constitutional procedure for passage and enactment of laws. In quite the same way, our failure to observe the rules and procedures of this institution threaten, ultimately, democratic representation of the American people in the Congress. Disregarding our rules erodes the power conferred by citizens on each elected Member of the Congress, undermining the integrity of our legislative process. And it therefore weakens the Congress as an institution and contributes to cynicism and a loss of confidence among the citizenry about our competence to govern. If we do not take better care, I fear we will find this institution in decline. 
I know that my friend Senator Robert C. Byrd, whose knowledge of the Senate rules is unsurpassed, shares these concerns. Yesterday on the floor, he said this of the pending Omnibus Appropriations Act:  
I will never vote for another such monstrosity for as long as I am privileged to hold this office. I hope that I never see another such monstrosity. I will never again support such a convolution of the legislative process as the one we have seen this year, and I hope that others will agree that this process is just as silly and as sad and as ridiculous and as disgraceful as I think it is. I hope they will join me in an effort to prevent it in the future. 
That is not the kind of statement that Robert C. Byrd, the Ranking Member of the Committee on Appropriations and our sometime President pro tempore, would make lightly. I hope Senators were listening. 
Perhaps the Committee on Rules and Administration, on which Senator Byrd and I serve together, will see fit to take up this issue. And I do hope all Senators will recognize the importance of regular order and take greater care with the rules of this institution when the 106th Congress convenes in January of 1999. 
In the meantime, on this measure, my vote is No.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we wind up the 105th Congress, I would like to commend Senator Bennett and the Special Committee on the Year 2000 (Y2K) Technology Problem for their work in addressing the computer problem. The Committee has done a fine job in looking at the impact of Y2K on all aspects of our critical infrastructure: the utilities industry, the health care sector, financial services, transportation, government, and businesses. The Committee should also be applauded for the role it played in formulating and passing S. 2392, The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. As an original cosponsor of this piece of legislation, I am delighted to see that the President signed it into law yesterday. This bill should help us ameliorate the Y2K problem. I say well done to the Committee for all of the work it has done in such a short amount of time. 
Almost two and a half years ago, in the 104th Congress, I sounded the alarm on the computer problem. On July 31, 1996, I sent President Clinton a letter expressing my views and concerns about Y2K. I warned him of the `extreme negative economic consequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,' and suggested that `a presidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that all Federal Agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by January 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial and industrial firms doing business with the Federal government must also be compliant by that date.' 
January 1, 1999 is quickly approaching. Progress has been made on the Y2K problem. The public and private sector are starting to give it the attention that it deserves. But much work remains to be done. As we head into the 106th Congress, we must continue to work on this problem with dedication and resolve. 
Historically, the fin de sieÿAE2cle has caused quite a stir. Until now, however, there has been little factual basis on which doomsayers and apocalyptic fear mongers could spread their gospel. After studying the potential impact of Y2K on the telecommunications industry, health care, economy, and other vital sectors of our lives, I would like to warn that we have cause for fear. For the failure to address the millennium bug could be catastrophic.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today humbled by the considerable accomplishments of a great friend and colleague, Lee Hamilton of Indiana. After 17 terms, he will leave the House of Representatives at year's end. What a profound loss for us all. 
Not surprisingly, Lee Hamilton continues to be recognized for his achievements. Last Tuesday's New York Times quotes Congressman Hamilton as `feeling pretty good about the job' he has held for 34 years. `I have more confidence in the institutions of government and the Congress than most of my constituents. The process is often untidy, but it works.' David S. Broder wrote in a column entitled `Lee Hamilton's Mark,' `. . . no one will be more missed by his colleagues of both parties than Lee Hamilton of Indiana . . . (h)e is an exemplar of the common-sense, instinctively moderate model of legislator that used to be common in Congress but is increasingly rare today.' 
I had the honor of serving with Representative Hamilton on the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy (1995-1997). Our Commission recommended unanimously that legislation should be adopted to govern the system of classifying and declassifying information, which for a half century has been left to executive regulation. The Congressional members of the Commission introduced such legislation in the House and Senate and one of my largest regrets for the 105th Congress is that we could not get this legislation adopted in honor of Lee Hamilton's retirement. This will take some time, but eventually, surely, we will pass such a bill. 
As the former Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, the Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms Transactions with Iran, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Lee Hamilton has showed an extraordinary capacity to lead our country through difficult times. Last year, Lee received the Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award from the Center for National Policy and, just last month, the Hubert Humphrey Award from the American Political Science Association. 
I might note here that Hubert Humphrey was the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars here in Washington. To our great benefit, Lee Hamilton has just recently agreed to head the Wilson Center. He will assume his new post in January, succeeding the Center's distinguished director, Charles Blitzer. Dr. Blitzer's tremendous achievement--the building of a permanent home for the Wilson Center at the now complete Federal Triangle--fulfills the commitment to President Wilson's living memorial as established in its 1968 founding statute. That statute required that the Center be located on Pennsylvania Avenue. Today the Wilson Center can be found at One Woodrow Wilson Plaza on Pennsylvania Avenue where it maintains architectural and functional autonomy from its neighbor, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. 
It is of enormous comfort to this Senator to know that Lee Hamilton will remain close at hand and continue to engage us all in matters of great import.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Dr. Robert F. Furchgott of the State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn on winning the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 
Dr. Furchgott, along with Dr. Louis J. Ignarro of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Ferid Murad of the University of Texas, were awarded the Nobel Prize for their discoveries of how natural production of nitric oxide can mediate a wide variety of bodily actions. Those include the regulation of blood pressure, widening blood vessels, preventing the formation of blood clots, fighting infections, reducing sexual dysfunction, and functioning as a signal molecule in the nervous system. 
The bestowment of this prestigious honor to Dr. Furchgott brings long overdue recognition to the medical research conducted at `SUNY Downstate'. I commend Dr. Furchgott and the entire staff of the State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn for their many contributions to the field of medicine.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the news from Russia remains grim. The Times reported on Saturday: 
Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a plummeting ruble, Russia appealed today for relief aid from the European Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada for help. 
Clearly Russia is in a perilous--one could say dangerous--state. The grain harvest is down almost 40 percent primarily because of a summer drought in the Volga River and Ural regions. And the financial crisis in Russia has only added to the problems. For example the Times also reports that because payment has not been made `15 ships full of American frozen poultry have delayed unloading their cargo.' 
What to do? For starters let's not repeat the mistakes of the past. Following the defeat of Germany in World War I, we failed to provide aid to the Weimar Republic as it attempted to sustain a democratic government. The resulting Nazi reign of terror was both devastating and unspeakable. 
By contrast, following the defeat of the Nazis in World War II, we adopted the Marshall Plan to rebuild a democratic Germany. From 1948 to 1952, the United States gave almost $3 billion a year to fund the Marshall Plan. A comparable contribution in round numbers, given the current size of the United States economy, would be about $100 billion a year for five years. 
Recognize that Russia, no less than Nazi Germany, is a defeated nation--the latter on the military battlefield, the former on the economic battlefield. To keep Russia on the road to democracy and economic reform will require economic aid perhaps on the scale of the Marshall Plan. When you consider what we have been through, a post cold war Marshall Plan does not seem excessive. Particularly since we were able to fund the Marshall Plan at the same time we were threatened by an empire that subscribed to the view that eventually the entire world would succumb to communism. 
The singular truth is that we were utterly unprepared for the collapse of the Soviet Union. During the 1980s we began a defense build up which resulted in the largest debt the United States has ever known. When the Soviet Union did collapse, we felt broke and unable to launch the kind of economic assistance that we were able to do after World War II. 
While we have provided some assistance, it falls far short of Russia's needs and lacks a coherent plan. Such a plan would include technical assistance on tax collections, operations of banks and stock exchanges, protection of property and individual rights to name just a few areas that a country with little or no experience with democracy and free markets might find helpful. Let me emphasize: without real short- and long-term financial assistance none of this technical assistance will be effective or, indeed, welcome. 
But the United States cannot do it alone. What would make the countries of Central and Eastern Europe more secure than any military alliance would be membership in the European Union. Unfortunately, our Western European allies have not embraced their eastern neighbors in this way. 
Ambassador Richard Holbrooke has explained that to a certain extent, expanding NATO served as a surrogate for EU enlargement. Roger Cohen reports Ambassador Holbrooke's remark in the International Herald Tribune: 
Almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin Wall fell and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the European Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common currency. So NATO enlargement had to fill the void. 
We seem to have stumbled into a reflexive anti-Russian mode. The United States continues to act as though the Cold War is still the central reality of foreign policy, withal there has been a turnover and we now have the ball and it is time to move downfield. For instance, in a Times story on Sunday about the selection of a trans-Caucus oil pipeline, it was reported: 
The Administration favored the Baku-Ceyhan route because it would pass through only relatively friendly countries--Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey--and would bind them closer to the West; because it would pull Azerbaijan and Georgia out of the Russian shadow; and because it would not pass through either Russia or Iran, both of which have offered routes of their own. 
Is `binding' Azerbaijan and Georgia closer to the West part of a flawed strategy of isolating Russia? We seem clearly headed in that direction with the expansion of NATO. And ignoring George F. Kennan, who lamented the Senate vote on NATO expansion in an interview with Thomas L. Friedman. Commenting on the Senate debate, Ambassador Kennan stated: 
I was particularly bothered by the references to Russia as a country dying to attack Western Europe. Don't people understand? Our differences in the cold war were with the Soviet Communist regime. And now we are turning our backs on the very people who mounted the greatest bloodless revolution in history to remove the Soviet Regime. 
We would do well to remember these words.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, along with our esteemed Chairman, Senator Roth, a Senate Finance Committee bill to extend a package of expired tax provisions. Unfortunately, dealing with this group of expired tax items has become a routine annual event for the Committee and for the Congress. This bill extends universally popular items such as the credit for increasing research activities, the Work Opportunity Credit, and the deduction for gifts of appreciated stock to private foundations through June of next year. It is my hope that 1999 will be the year that the entire group of `extenders' are finally made permanent. 
We thank Senator Roth for ensuring that the Finance Committee is heard on this matter. Our action is a reminder that the United States Congress does not act, on tax bills or any other measures, as a unicameral legislature. Indeed, this Finance committee measure improves in several ways on the bill passed by the House Ways and Means Committee yesterday: 
First, we extend the Trade Assistance Program from October 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999. This is an important program established in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that provides training and income support for workers adversely affected by import competition. It is a commitment we have made to workers, and it ought to be kept. 
Second, the bill includes a provision that prevents the tax benefit of nonrefundable personal credits such as the $500 per child credit and the adoption credit from being eroded by the Alternative Minimum Tax. This was to have been included as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, but was dropped for some unknown reason as part of the final compromise. Without the `fix' included in this bill, we will trap many unsuspecting taxpayers who sit down to prepare their 1998 Federal income tax returns next spring. 
I applaud the work of the chairman and the committee in moving quickly to agree on this bill and, for the greater good, deferring action on a number of very important narrower items until next year.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished Chairman, Senator Roth, and other colleagues in introducing a bill to improve the home health interim payment system. 
Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), home health agencies were reimbursed on a cost basis for all their costs, as long as they maintained average costs below certain limits. That payment system provided incentives for home health agencies to increase the volume of services delivered to patients, and it attracted many new agencies to the program. From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew at an average annual rate of 33 percent, while the number of home health agencies increased from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in 1997. 
In order to constrain the growth in costs and usage of home care, the BBA included provisions that would establish a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for home health care, a method of paying health care providers whereby rates are established in advance. An interim payment system (IPS) was also established while the Health Care Financing Administration works to develop the PPS for home health care agencies. 
The home health care industry is dissatisfied with the IPS. The resulting concern expressed by many Members of Congress prompted us to ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the question of beneficiary access to home care. While the GAO found that neither agency closures nor the interim payment system significantly affected beneficiary access to care, I remain concerned that the potential closure of many more home health agencies might ultimately affect the care that beneficiaries receive, particularly beneficiaries with chronic illness. 
The bill we are introducing today adjusts the interim payment system to achieve equity and fairness in payments to home health agencies. It would reduce extreme variations in payment limits applicable to old agencies within states and across states and would reduce artificial payment level differences between `old' and `new' agencies. The bill would provide all agencies a longer transition period in which to adjust to changed payment limits. 
Clearly, since the bill may not address all the concerns raised by Medicare beneficiaries and by home health agencies, we should revisit this issue next year. A thorough review is needed to determine whether the funding mechanism for home health is sufficient, fair and appropriate, and whether the benefit is meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries. 
America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have given many Medicare beneficiaries the ability to stay home while receiving medical care. An adjustment to the interim payment system and delay in further payment reductions will enable home health agencies to survive the transition into the prospective payment system while continuing to provide essential care for beneficiaries.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to New York's Dr. Michael K. Simpson who last year completed ten years of service as President of Utica College at Syracuse University and is now President of the American University in Paris. 
While at Utica, Dr. Simpson taught international relations, contemporary French politics, international law, the political economics of multinational corporations, macro- and microeconomics, and American foreign policy. He has also been a visiting professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University and director of Syracuse's study center in Strasbourg, France. 
In addition to his broad academic experience, Dr. Simpson has dedicated himself to the people of Oneida County, New York. As the community representative and chairperson of the Health and Hospital Council of the Mohawk Valley from 1987-1992, he lead that Council toward developing a hospital consolidation plan for four area hospitals. That succeeded in making quality health-care more accessible and affordable to local residents. Since 1988 he has been a trustee of The Savings Bank of Utica. 
I have had the privilege to speak at three commencements in which Michael Simpson participated--at his graduation from Fordham College in 1970 when he earned his bachelor's degree, at Syracuse University in 1983 upon receipt of his M.B.A., and during his tenure as Utica College President. 
With great admiration and gratitude I commend Dr. Simpson for his commitment to excellence in education and his service to his fellow citizens of New York. I wish him all the best on his sojourn in Paris.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today this nation takes time to honor the deeds of some of our bravest public servants, the men and women who make up this country's federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies and departments. These officers are the guardians of our safety, the protectors of our hearths and homes. Often in harm's way, they are the ever-vigilant heroes of our communities, towns and cities. 
These words particularly ring true when they are applied to the eight New York City Police Department officers who are among those honored here today. In July 1997, Officers Joseph Dolan, Michael Keenan, David Marinez, Mario Zorovic, Sergeant John English, Jr., Lieutenant Owen McCaffrey, Deputy Inspector Raymond McDermott, and Captain Ralph Pascullo prevented two men from attempting to blow up a portion of New York City's subway system with homemade pipe bombs. 
These eight officers spearheaded a team that entered the apartment where these two men lived. Once inside, the officers disabled these men and recovered four unexploded pipe bombs. Their bravery and professionalism undoubtedly saved countless lives and prevented a bloody catastrophs. 
I am extremely proud of these men and take great pride in calling them New York City's finest.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished Chairman, Senator Roth, and other colleagues in introducing a bill to improve the home health interim payment system. 
Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), home health agencies were reimbursed on a cost basis for all their costs, as long as they maintained average costs below certain limits. That payment system provided incentives for home health agencies to increase the volume of services delivered to patients, and it attracted many new agencies to the program. From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew at an average annual rate of 33 percent, while the number of home health agencies increased from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in 1997. 
In order to constrain the growth in costs and usage of home care, the BBA included provisions that would establish a Prospective Payment System (PPS) for home health care, a method of paying health care providers whereby rates are established in advance. An interim payment system (IPS) was also established while the Health Care Financing Administration works to develop the PPS for home health care agencies. 
The home health care industry is dissatisfied with the IPS. The resulting concern expressed by many Members of Congress prompted us to ask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the question of beneficiary access to home care. While the GAO found that neither agency closures nor the interim payment system significantly affected beneficiary access to care, I remain concerned that the potential closure of many more home health agencies might ultimately affect the care that beneficiaries receive, particularly beneficiaries with chronic illness. 
The bill we are introducing today adjusts the interim payment system to achieve equity and fairness in payments to home health agencies. It would reduce extreme variations in payment limits applicable to old agencies within states and across states and would reduce artificial payment level differences between `old' and `new' agencies. The bill would provide all agencies a longer transition period in which to adjust to changed payment limits. 
Clearly, since the bill may not address all the concerns raised by Medicare beneficiaries and by home health agencies, we should revisit this issue next year. A thorough review is needed to determine whether the funding mechanism for home health is sufficient, fair and appropriate, and whether the benefit is meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries. 
America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have given many Medicare beneficiaries the ability to stay home while receiving medical care. An adjustment to the interim payment system and delay in further payment reductions will enable home health agencies to survive the transition into the prospective payment system while continuing to provide essential care for beneficiaries.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I first want to thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his insistence that the Internet Tax Freedom Act be considered by the Finance Committee before any action on this floor. I recognize and applaud all of the effort that has gone into the other proposals dealing with this subject, and in particular we should acknowledge the work of Senators Wyden, McCain, Dorgan, Graham, Lieberman, and Gregg. 
Since June of 1997, the chairman and I sought referral of this legislation to give the Finance Committee the opportunity to consider the important tax and trade issues related to the Internet, which by some estimates will grow to $300 billion of commercial transactions annually by the year 2000. The bill was finally referred to the Finance Committee on July 21st of this year. 
That referral to the Finance Committee was consistent with Senate precedents. In recent years, the Finance Committee has had jurisdiction over at least two other pieces of legislation with direct impact on state and local taxes. Both the `source tax' bill that was of great interest to Senators Bryan, Reid, and Baucus, prohibiting states from taxing the pensions of former residents, and Senator bumpers' mail order sales tax proposal, requiring mail order companies to collect and remit sales taxes due on goods shipped across state lines, were referred to the Finance Committee. 
The legislation before us today also deals directly with international trade. It requests that the administration continue to seek trade agreements that keep the Internet free from foreign tariffs and other trade barriers. As reported by the Finance Committee, this bill would establish trade objectives designed to guide future negotiations over the regulation of electronic commerce--issues clearly within the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. 
A few comments on the substance of this legislation. I am not entirely persuaded that there is a pressing need for a federal moratorium on the power of state and local governments to impose and collect certain taxes, but it seems clear that such a moratorium does enjoy a great deal of support. The two-year moratorium period in the Finance Committee bill and the three-year period agreed to as a floor amendment during this debate is surely preferable to the six-year provision in the Commerce Committee bill. 
There is some question whether such a moratorium is actually necessary. New York is proof that States do not need a directive from Congress to act on this matter: Governor Pataki and the New York State legislature have agreed on a bill exempting Internet access services from State or local sales, use, and telecommunications taxes. The Governor's legislation also makes it clear that out-of-state businesses will not be subject to State or local taxes in New York solely because they advertise on the Internet. 
I am pleased that the Finance Committee's bill preserves the right of States or local governments to collect tax with respect to transactions occurring before July 29, 1998 (the date of Finance Committee action). Further, I am pleased that language has been added on the floor that goes beyond the Finance Committee bill and `grandfathers' any existing State and local taxes on Internet activity occurring during the period of the moratorium. 
With respect to the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce established, a membership of 16, almost half of that in the House bill, is manageable and is more likely to lead to meaningful recommendations. An item of particular interest to me is the requirement in that the Commission examine the application of the existing Federal `communications services' excise tax to the Internet and Internet access. We need to know more about how and whether that tax should apply to new technology. 
This bill is not perfect, but on balance I believe it deserves our support. I urge its adoption and hope it can be enacted this year.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the United States Congress acts to authorize the placement of a statute of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi--Mahatma Gandi--on Federal land across the street from the Indian embassy in Washington D.C. Such a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, often called the father of the Indian nation, would serve as a fitting tribute to Indian democracy which has survived--in fact, thrived--despite enormous challenges. It will stand as a symbol of the growing strength of the bonds between our two countries. 
The Government of India has offered a statute of Gandhi as a gift to the United States. In order to place it on Federal land, an act of Congress is required. This bill will fulfill just that purpose, and I thank the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack and the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes for joining me in this endeavor. 
It is particularly appropriate that a statute of Mahatma Gandhi be selected as a symbol of our ties. The effects of Gandhi's non-violent actions and the philosophy that guided him, were not limited to his country, or his time. Perhaps less known is that Gandhi drew inspiration from an American. While in South Africa, Gandhi read Thoreau's essay `Civil Disobedience,' which confirmed his view that an honest man is duty-bound to violate unjust laws. He took this view home with him, and in the end the British raj gave way to an independent Republic of India. Then Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. repatriated the idea, and so began the great American civil rights movement of this century. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. has written of the singular influence Gandhi's message of non-violent resistance had on him when he first learned of it while studying at Crozier Theological seminary in Philadelphia. He would later describe Gandhi's influence on him in, `Stride Toward Freedom': 
As I read I became deeply fascinated by [Gandhi's] philosphy of non-violent resistance . . . as I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see its potency in the area of social reform . . . prior to reading Gandhi, I had concluded that the love ethics of Jesus were only effective in individual relationships . . . but after reading Gandhi, I saw how utterly mistaken I was. 
. . . It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and non-violence that I discovered the method for social reform that I had been seeking for so many months . . . I came to feel that this was the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom . . . this principle became the guiding light of our movement. Christ furnished the spirit and motivation and Gandhi furnished the method. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. believed that Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance was the `guiding light' of the American civil rights movement. As Dr. King explained, `Gandhi furnished the message.' A statue of Gandhi, given as a gift from the Government of India, on a small plot of Federal land along Massachusetts Avenue in front of the Indian embassy, will stand not only as a tribute to the shared values of the two largest democracies in the world, but will also pay tribute to the lasting influence of Gandhian thought on the United States.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence brings to the floor the conference report on the intelligence authorization bill. While I commend the Committee for bringing this legislation to the floor, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss a bill that the committee did not act on this year: the government Secrecy Reform Act (S. 712). 
This legislation stems from the unanimous recommendation of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. Senator Jesse Helms and I, and Representatives Larry Combest and Lee Hamilton (all Commissioners), introduced the Government Secrecy Act in May 1997. The bill sets out a new legislative framework to govern our secrecy system. Our core objective is to ensure that secrecy proceed according to law. The proposed statute can help ensure that the present regulatory regime will not simply continue to flourish without any restraint and without meaningful oversight and accountability. 
A trenchant example of the need for reform in this area came last week by way of the Assassination Records Review Board. The Board has now completed its congressionally mandated review and release of documents related to President Kennedy's assassination. It has assembled at the National Archives a thorough collection of documents and evidence that was previously secret and scattered about the government. The Review Board found that while the public continues to search for answers over the past thirty-five years: 
[T]he official record on the assassination of President Kennedy remained shrouded in secrecy and mystery. 
The suspicions created by government secrecy eroded confidence in the truthfulness of federal agencies in general and damaged their credibility. 
Credibility eroded needlessly, as most of the documents which the Board reviewed were declassified. And at considerable cost, as it represents the best-known and most notorious conspiracy theory now extant: the unwillingness on the part of the vast majority of the American public to accept that President Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. 
Conspiracy theories have been with us since the birth of the Republic. This one seems to have only grown. A poll taken in 1966, two years after release of the Warren Commission report concluding that Oswald had acted alone, found that 36 percent of respondents accepted this finding, while 50 percent believed others had been involved in a conspiracy to kill the President. by 1978 only 18 percent responded that they believed the assassination had been the act of one man; fully 75 percent believed there had been a broader plot. The numbers have remained relatively steady since; a 1993 poll also found that three-quarters of those surveyed believed (consistent with the film JFK, released that year) that there had been a conspiracy. 
It so happens that I was in the White House at the hour of the President's death (I was an assistant labor secretary at the time). I feared what would become of him if he were not protected, and I pleaded that we must get custody of Oswald. But no one seemed to be able to hear. Presently Oswald was killed, significantly complicating matters. 
I did not think there had been a conspiracy to kill the president, but I was convinced that the American people would sooner or later come to believe that there had been one unless we investigated the event with exactly that presumption in mind. The Warren Commission report and the other subsequent investigations, with their nearly universal reliance on secrecy, did not dispel any such fantasies. 
In conducting this document-by-document review of classified information, the Board reports that `the federal government needlessly and wastefully classified and then withheld from public access countless important records that did not require such treatment.' How to explain this? 
Beginning with the concept that secrecy should be understood as a form of government regulation. This was an insight of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which I chaired, building on the work of the great German sociologist Max Weber, who wrote some eight decades ago: 
The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional interests make for secrecy. The concept of the `official secret' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fantastically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond these specifically qualified areas. 
What we traditionally think of in this country as regulation concerns how citizens are to behave. Whereas public regulation involves what the citizen may do, secrecy concerns what that citizen may know. And the citizen does not know what may not be known. As our Commission stated: `Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of the regulation.' 
Thus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated! It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it malfunctions. In our democracy, where the free exchange of ideas is so essential, it can be suffocating. 
And so the Commission recommended that legislation must be enacted. The Majority and Minority Leaders have been persuaded on the necessity of such legislation and are cosponsors of the bill. On March 3, 1998, we engaged in a colleague on the bill with the two Leaders, along with myself, Senators Helms, Thompson, Glenn, Shelby, and Kerrey. At that time we all agreed on the importance of considering the bill in this session. The Majority Leader stated, `I hope that this process of committee consideration can be completed this spring and that we can expeditiously schedule floor time for legislation addressing this important issue. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Senator Thompson, considered the bill and approved it unanimously on July 22. In its report to accompany the bill, the Committee had this important insight: 
Our liberties depend on the balanced structure created by James Madison and the other framers of the Constitution. The national security information system has not had a clear legislative foundation, but . . . has been developed through a series of executive orders. It is time to bring this executive monopoly over the issue to an end, and to begin to engage in the same sort of dialogue between Congress and the executive that characterizes the development of government policy in all other means. 
We are not proposing putting an end to government secrecy. Far from it. It is at times terribly necessary and used for the most legitimate reasons--ranging from military operations to diplomatic endeavors. Indeed, much of our Commission's report is devoted to explaining the varied circumstances in which secrecy is most essential. Yet, the bureaucratic attachment to secrecy has become so warped that, in the words of Kermit Hall, a member of the Assassination Records Review Board, it has transformed into `a deeply ingrained commitment to secrecy as a form of patriotism.' 
Secrecy need not remain the only norm--particularly when one considers that the current badly overextended system frequently fails to protect its most important secrets adequately. We must develop what might be termed a competing `culture of openness'--fully consistent with our interests in protecting national security, but in which power and authority are no longer derived primarily from one's ability to withhold information from others in government and the public at large. 
Unfortunately, the Intelligence Committee did not take up this bill. Part of the delay was a result of the tardy administration response to the changes made by the Governmental Affairs Committee. A formal letter on the bill was not delivered until September 17. In addition, this letter sought the removal of the `balancing test' contained in the bill, a change that the administration had not previously sought. 
Nevertheless, we were on the threshold of reaching agreement on the bill. The Intelligence Committee has been reviewing the bill informally, and I hope the Chairman will agree that the difference between us are not that great, and that we can pass the bill early in the 106th Congress.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague Senator Chafee to introduce the `Federal Employee Flexibility Act of 1998,' a bill to provide Federal employees with the commuting benefits that were created in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, known as TEA-21, and are now available for private sector employees. 
This Act is part of an ongoing effort that we started over seven years ago in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act to introduce pricing and economic incentives into our national transportation policy. Traditionally, U.S. transportation policy has favored new highway construction over repair and maintenance and auto travel over transit and other modes. Our tax code also reflected this bias by providing large incentives to employers to offer their employees tax-free parking spaces, while making it less attractive to provide transit or cash benefits in lieu of parking. 
The Finance Committee first set out to tackle this problem in the National Energy Policy Act of 1992. That Act capped non-taxable monthly parking benefits at $155, increased monthly transit benefits from $21 to $60, and added an annual COLA adjustment for both. However, because of the `constructive receipt' principle in the tax code, under the 1992 Act, an employer could not offer his employees the tax-free commuting benefits in lieu of taxable salary. 
In other words, if an employer offered to provide his employees non-taxable $65 monthly transit passes but lower their salaries by $65 a month, and any employee chose to keep the salary--maybe they walk to work--under the `constructive receipt' principle, the transit passes for the other employees would lose their tax-free status. This made the transit benefit program of only limited attractiveness to employers since they could only offer it as part of a negotiated increase in salary, not as a benefit in lieu of existing salary. 
Likewise, Federal tax code allowed an employer to offer tax-free parking up to a value of 4170 per month per employee. However, if an employer gave just one employee a choice between parking and some other taxable benefit--such as increased salary--the parking of all other employees in the company became taxable. The result--employers have had no incentive to offer employees the opportunity to `cash out' their parking, perhaps taking an increase in salary and using mass transit or carpooling. That hidden pro-parking bias in the tax code has likely resulted in far too many employees choosing to drive to work over riding transit and other modes. 
The tax title of TEA-21 now contains the proper language and offsets in place to eliminate this `constructive receipt' requirement--and increase the transit benefit from its current $65 to $100 in 2002. It means that employers who provide the transit benefit in lieu of salary will pay less in payroll taxes, while employees will receive a benefit worth a full $65, instead of taxable income of $65. Likewise employers can now offer employee cash instead of a tax-free parking parking space, and we hope reduce the number of employees who drive to work. The measure is `paid for,' in Budget Act parlance, by a one-year freeze in the COLA adjustments for parking benefits, currently at $175 per month, and transit benefits. 
But, unfortunately, the job is not quite done. Federal employees will not be able to benefit from the increased flexibility available to private sector employees, unless Federal compensation law is modified. Current Federal law provides that a Federal employee may not receive additional pay unless specifically authorized by law. Therefore, a Federal employee could not `cash out' a parking space at work, and instead receive cash or other benefits. This has particularly unfortunate consequences here in Washington, one of the most congested cities in the country, with an enormous Federal workforce, the great majority of whom drive single-occupancy vehicles to work every day. 
The simple bill that Senator Chafee and I introduce today would add `taxable cash reimbursement for the value of an employer-provided parking space' to the list of benefits Federal employees can receive. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this bill and that we can act swiftly on this bill in the next session of Congress.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the growing chorus of people proclaiming, `Thank God for baseball!' In this otherwise tumultuous year, the national pastime is back. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa broke Ruthian (and Marisian!) records, Cal Ripken voluntarily ended his heroic streak of 2,632 consecutive games played (a record which may never be broken) and, most importantly, the New York Yankees and the incomparable Joe Torre are back on top. Well done! 
While New Yorkers have grown accustomed to the success of the Bronx Bombers, 1998 is truly a departure from anything we've witnessed of late. The numbers astound. Their 114 regular season victories are the most in baseball since the 1906 Chicago Cubs. Bernie Williams took the batting title, and on May 17 David Wells hurled the first perfect game by a Yankee pitcher since Don Larsen's masterpiece in game five of the 1956 World Series. (I was an aide to Governor Harriman at the time.) On Friday night, after a three-hour rain delay, the Yankees swept the prodigiously talented Texas Rangers 3-0 in their first-round American League playoff series. 
Sadly, the season is not without its concerns. Darryl Strawberry, the embattled talent who so bravely and admirably turned his life and career around these past few years, was diagnosed last week with colon cancer. The Yankees outfielder/designated hitter underwent surgery Saturday and the prognosis of a full recovery is excellent. Our prayers are with him. 
Tonight, in the Bronx, the Yankees will host the Cleveland Indians in the first game of the American League Championship Series, the winner to face the Atlanta Braves or San Diego Padres in the World Series. No doubt Darryl Strawberry will be in the hearts and minds of the entire team and city, as the Yankees continue their most remarkable season. Just two years ago, the Yankees won the World Series, and I was honored to ride in a motorcade down Broadway with Joe DiMaggio, the original Yankee Clipper. In all likelihood another parade is in the offing.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, many years ago Eugene L. McCabe came to Washington seeking financial support for his new North General Hospital in Harlem. By then people living in Harlem, like many in our cities, suffered from hospital cutbacks and closings. They were in desperate need of affordable and reliable medical care. The AIDS and crack epidemics overburdened what few local facilities there were. But where others saw despair, Eugene saw hope and opportunity. He founded North General as a community hospital specializing in the treatment of diabetes, cancer, and hypertension--common afflictions in urban areas. Still, North General did not become overnight what Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, called a wonderful hospital. It took Eugene's dedication, vision, and compassion to see it through. When told his hospital would fail because there was no money to be made, he worked harder. The hospital became his life's passion. He appealed to banks, businesses, and political leaders for support. And he made good on his promise. North General became a thriving hospital that has never lost touch with its community. It remains the only minority-run hospital in New York State. Located at 121st Street and Madison Avenue, North General Hospital stands as a memorial to Eugene McCabe and his dedication to improving the lives of others. 
With his passing much will be said of him. Those who worked with him remember a leader--self-assured and inspiring--who, despite popular motivations and trends, compelled himself and others to make affordable and quality health care a reality for many who might otherwise have gone without it. Those who loved him remember his smile, his helpfulness, and his gracious presence. Eugene McCabe's life was a blessing and we are grateful to have been touched by it.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just passed an enormous milestone in the composition of the American judiciary with the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the appointment to the second circuit court of appeals. It is a fine day for New York, I might say specifically for the Bronx, a fine day for the judiciary. 
I thank our distinguished Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and the majority leader, Mr. Lott, and his colleague, Mr. Daschle, and, of course, my colleague, Senator D'Amato. 
It was 7 years ago in March that I had the honor to nominate Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the southern district of New York. President Bush placed her name in nomination, and she was sworn in directly on October 1992. Her subsequent experience on the bench has been admirable. In 5 1/2 years, she has presided over 500 cases and has been overturned only 6 times. She has presided over cases of enormous complexity with skill and confidence that would befit the editor of the Yale Law Journal and a person who rose from the most simple circumstances in south Bronx to the eminence she is now assured. 
I thank the Senate, I thank all those involved, and I thank, not least, my friend from Arkansas for yielding me this time.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am opposed to implementing section 110 of the Immigration Reform Act of 1996. Its implementation would create widespread chaos and lead to untold congestion at our Northern borders' checkpoints, potentially creating havoc with our largest trading partner, Canada. 
Each year, more than eight million trucks cross the eastern United States-Canada border carrying a variety of goods to market. In addition, the Eastern Border Transportation Coalition estimates that over 57 million cars cross that border each year. Sixty percent of these are day trips--people crossing the border to go to work or school, attend cultural events or to shop. The remaining forty percent of auto border crossings were by vacationers. 
If implemented, an automated entry-exit system along the northern border would hamper both trade and tourism. This is not inconsequential. The United States-Canadian trade relationship is the largest in the world, totalling $272 billion in 1995. Compare this to $256 billion in trade for the entire European Union during that same period and one gets an idea of how important this relationship is and why it must remain unfettered by chaotic checkpoints.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on November 21, 1998, Mrs. Florence Brumer of Utica, New York, will celebrate her 90th birthday. She is fortunate to reach this milestone not only in good health and high spirits, but in the company of her husband of 64 years, Lou, and their two children and four grandchildren, all of their spouses, and one great-grandchild. 
A lifelong educator, Mrs. Brumer has touched many lives and been an inspiration to those around her. She received a bachelor's degree in education from New York University and a master's degree from the Teacher's College at Columbia University. She went on to spend over forty years as a teacher and curriculum supervisor in the New York City school system. When she retired in 1966, she moved upstate to Utica and became the city's most ardent promoter. An article in the local newspaper several years ago highlighted the Brumers' rave reviews of Utica's social and cultural life, which coming from Manhattan natives were particularly strong endorsements. 
One of the most remarkable aspects of Flo Brumer's life is her vigor and enthusiasm for a wide variety of activities. A cancer survivor, she was a pioneer in the crusade against smoking back in the days when there was no such thing as a `smoke-free environment.' Well into retirement, she donned sneakers and began the sport later known as `mall-walking.' She has a great passion for political discussions, instilled in her, perhaps, at the table of her uncle, William I. Sirovich, who served as a member of the U.S. Congress (D-NY) from 1927-39. And as a bridge fanatic, she continues to play and win regularly while trying to recruit new partners. 
Reaching one's 90th birthday is a notable occasion in and of itself, but to do so with such vitality and cheer is a truly great accomplishment. I offer her my heartiest congratulations and best wishes and close with a particularly apt Irish blessing: 
May joy and peace surround you 
Contentment latch your door, 
And happiness be with you now, 
And bless you evermore.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a small, but important, provision included in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Title IX clarifies existing law by making it permissible for colleges and universities to offer voluntary, age-based retirement incentives to tenured faculty in addition to their regular retirement benefits. 
The inclusion of the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act in the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act will provide a `safe harbor' for colleges and universities by clarifying that the early retirement incentives are permitted by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The faculty retirement incentive provision will benefit colleges and universities, as well as those faculty who choose to participate. As officials for the American Association of University Professors have stated, this provision will `provide greater flexibility in faculty retirement planning, offer a substantial retirement benefit to those professors who choose to retire under the terms of an incentive plan, and leave other professors whole in their choice to continue their careers.' 
At the beginning of the 105th Congress, Senator Ashcroft and I introduced legislation similar to the age-based retirement incentives language the House included in its Higher Education reauthorization bill. I was very pleased to learn of the diligent effort of those on the House Education and Work Force Committee to add this provision to their bill. 
I thank the members of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee for working with Senator Ashcroft and me on this issue. I especially thank Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their thoughtful consideration of this measure and for allowing it to remain in the bill during conference. Lastly, I express my appreciation to Senator Ashcroft for working closely with me on getting the Faculty Retirement Incentive bill into law.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I was delighted to see that the Senate passed S. 2392 (`The Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act') yesterday. I introduced this legislation with Senators Robert F. Bennett (R-UT) and Christopher J. Dodd (D-CT) on July 30, 1998. This `Good Samaritan' legislation is intended to promote the open sharing of information about Y2K solutions by protecting those who share information in good faith from liability claims based on the dissemination of that information. I want to make it clear that this legislation does not address liability that may arise separately from actual Y2K failures of systems or devices. The head of the President's Council on Y2K, John Koskinen, said that passing this bill is one of the most important things that we could do on the Y2K front. I agree. 
Over two years ago I stated `that the year 2000 problem is indeed serious, and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.' On July 31, 1996 I sent President Clinton a letter expressing my views and concerns about Y2K. I warned him of the `extreme negative economic consequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,' and suggested that `a presidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that all Federal Agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by January 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial and industrial firms doing business with the federal government must also be compliant by that date.' 
January 1, 1999 is quickly approaching. I believe the `Good Samaritan' legislation that my colleagues passed last night will play a significant role in helping private firms and the government in addressing the computer problem. I am hopeful that we will have this problem in check come the year 2000, but, as the Duke said of Waterloo, it will be `close run thing.'

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, three years ago, a quiet, law-abiding American family found itself suddenly and unavoidably caught up in the story of one of the most notorious criminal manhunts of the last quarter century in the United States. At this time, my constituents David R. Kaczynski and his wife Linda E. Patrik were confronted with a terrible dilemma. Published news reports led them to suspect they knew the identity of the `Unabomber,' the elusive criminal whose letter bombs had killed three people and injured several others over a 17-year period. 
Upon reading the Unabomber's `manifesto' published in the New York Times and Washington Post in September of 1995, Mr. Kaczynski and Ms. Patrik, residents of Schenectady, New York, came to the awful realization that the Unabomber might be David's brother, Theodore J. Kaczynski, whose letters they believed closely resembled the Unabomber's `manifesto.' David Kaczynski, a social worker, and Ms. Patrik, a professor of philosophy at Union College, understandably feared that disclosure of their suspicions might ultimately lead to the execution of David's brother for the crime of murder. Even so--and as painful as it was for them--they considered it their duty to notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which they did. 
Soon thereafter, Theodore Kaczynski was arrested in a small cabin in Montana, bringing to an end the Unabomber's long reign of violence. In January 1998, Theodore Kaczynski entered a plea agreement with federal prosecutors resulting in his sentence of life in prison without parole. 
Earlier this year, David Kaczynski and Linda Patrik received a $1 million reward from the FBI for the information they supplied. And it was characteristic of these fine citizens that they immediately pledged, after taxes and attorneys' fees, to pay every cent of the reward to the Unabomber's victims and their families. 
For over two years, David Kaczynski, his family, and his attorney spent countless hours involved in efforts associated with the investigation, capture, and trial of Theodore Kaczynski. Now they are attempting to do the right and noble thing by pledging the reward money to help those injured by a deeply troubled member of their family. It would be ironic and I believe unjust if the federal government were to diminish this selfless act by taxing the Kaczynskis or those to whom they have agreed to pay the reward monies. Therefore we are introducing a bill today to increase the amount available to the Unabomber's victims and their families by exempting from federal taxation all amounts donated to the victims, as well as attorney's fees incurred in the matter. 
Mr. President, surely this is the least we can do to express our gratitude to David Kaczynski and Linda Patrik, and our sorrow and condolences to the victims and their families. I hope all Senators will support this simple but much-needed measure.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is a simple proposal to obtain numbers about a Federal program as regards the respective States. As a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works for the last 22 years, I served as chairman, at one point, and handled a number of highway bills, as we call them, transportation bills, and have been involved with negotiations with the House in these matters. 
One of the subjects that comes forward continuously is the payments by respective State residents, or persons passing through a State, into the highway trust fund. This was established in 1956 by President Eisenhower, under his administration, on the recommendation of a commission headed by General Clay, with the previous Speaker, Mr. Wright of Texas, as one of the persons animating the effort in the Congress. 
There was a source of funding for the Interstate and Defense Highway Program. Indeed, there was, and we have very successfully finished that program and we continue to fund transportation projects across the Nation with those revenues as they come in. 
Now, in 1986 we established the airport and airway trust fund. It is a ticket tax and other taxes. It brings considerable revenue, as anyone who has recently ridden on the Washington-New York shuttle can attest. In fiscal year 1998, we estimate that $4.5 billion was collected in ticket taxes. 
However, we have no State-by-State analysis of the dollar contributions. Inevitably and properly, the moneys are used by the Federal Aviation Administration to provide airport projects around the Nation, but with no accounting for the relative contributions of the different States with the thought that there be some proportionality as to the return to the States. I say `some'--nothing precise, nothing is proposed in this amendment to make such a proportionality requirement. Indeed, it is not desired. 
Public policy on transportation should follow the needs of transportation, and yet it is reasonable to assume that Senators and Representatives will expect some relationship between what their State provides and what it receives. That may now take place; it may not take place. The answer is we don't know. 
The most normal function of government when it collects a tax is to record the origins and the specifics of the revenue stream. There will be some difficulty doing this. It is tricky. A good number of airline tickets are now purchased on the Internet as opposed to travel agents or at the airport. These are methodological problems which the Treasury is entirely capable of dealing with through sampling and other devices. This amendment quite specifically says, `as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this act and annually thereafter,' that the Secretary of the Treasury will report to the Secretary of Transportation. 
The term `as soon as practicable' gives the Treasury the leeway it requires to get these numbers and break them down. It is routine government. It is good government. It is an opportunity to avoid a great deal of misunderstanding and discord in the committees involved and on the floor as we ask how appropriate, and in a general sense, how fair the use of these funds is--the allocation of these funds once they have been obligated through taxation. 
Accordingly, I hope the Senate can approve this amendment. 
Mr. President, I respectfully inquire of the managers whether this straightforward measure could be accepted and spare the Senate the time.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend to the Senate a most timely and informative article which appeared in the New York Times on August 11, 1998. Written by Todd S. Purdum, the article provides a useful overview of the twenty year history of the independent counsel law and interviews seven of the attorneys who have served in this capacity since the adoption of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. 
Most of those interviewed cite problems with the way the independent counsel process currently works and provide specific recommendations for improvement. Those of us in the Congress will soon have an opportunity to review this matter in greater detail for, as you may know, its current provisions, reauthorized and amended by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994, P.L. 103-270, June 30, 1994, will expire on June 30, 1999, unless reauthorized.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Enhancing Family Life Act of 1998, a bill inspired by an extraordinary set of proposals by one of our nation's most eminent social scientists, Professor James Q. Wilson. On December 4, 1997, I had the honor of hearing Professor Wilson--who is an old and dear friend--deliver the Francis Boyer Lecture at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The Boyer Lecture is delivered at AEI's annual dinner by a thinker who has `made notable intellectual or practical contributions to improved public policy and social welfare.' Previous Boyer lecturers have included Irving Kristol, Alan Greenspan, and Henry Kissinger. In his lecture, Professor Wilson argued that `two nations' now exist within the United States. He said: 
In one nation, a child, raised by two parents, acquires an education, a job, a spouse, and a home kept separate from crime and disorder by distance, fences, or guards. In the other nation, a child is raised by an unwed girl, lives in a neighborhood filled with many sexual men but few committed fathers, and finds gang life to be necessary for self-protection and valuable for self-advancement. 
Sadly, this is an all-too-accurate portrait of the American underclass, the problems of which have been the focus of decades of unsuccessful welfare reform and crime control efforts. We have tried a great many `solutions,' as Professor Wilson notes:  
Congress has devised community action, built public housing, created a Job Corps, distributed Food Stamps, given federal funds to low-income schools, supported job training, and provided cash grants to working families. 
Yet still we are faced with two nations. Professor Wilson explains why: `[t]he family problem lies at the heart of the emergency of two nations.' He notes that as our families become weaker--as more and more American children are born outside of marriage and raised by one, not two, parents--the foundation of our society becomes weaker. This deterioration helps to explain why, as reported by the Census Bureau today, the poverty rate for American children is almost twice that for adults aged 18 to 64 (19.9 percent for children versus 10.9 percent for adults). And it grows increasingly difficult for government to address the problems of that `second nation.' Professor Wilson even quotes the Senator from New York to this effect: `If you expect a government program to change families, you know more about government than I do.' 
Even so, Jim Wilson, quite characteristically, has fresh ideas about what might help. On the basis of recent scholarly research, and common sense, he urged in the Boyer lecture that we refocus our attention on the vital period of early childhood. I was so impressed with his lecture that afterward I set about writing a bill to put his recommendations into effect. 
The Enhancing Family Life Act of 1998 contains four key elements, all of which are related to families. First, it supports `second chance' maternity homes for unwed teenage mothers. These are group homes where young women would live with their children under strict adult supervision and have the support necessary to become productive members of society. The bill provides $45 million a year to create such homes or expand existing ones. 
Second, it promotes adoption. The bill expands the number of children in foster care eligible for federal adoption incentives. Too many children drift in foster care; we should do more to find them permanent homes. The bill also encourages states to experiment with `per capita' approaches to finding these permanent homes for foster children, a strategy Kansas has used with success. 
Third, it funds collaborative early childhood development programs. Recent research has reminded us of the critical importance of the first few years of a child's life. States would have great flexibility in the use of these funds; for example, the money could be used for pre-school programs for poor children or home visits of parents of young children. It provides $3.75 billion over five years for this purpose. 
Finally, the legislation creates a new education assistance program to enable more parents to remain home with young children. A parent who temporarily leaves the work force to raise a child would be eligible for an educational grant, similar to the Pell Grant, to help the parent enter, or re-enter, the labor market with skills and credentials necessary for success in today's economy once the child is older.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of my colleagues the generous gift by the Mailman Foundation to the Columbia University School of Public Health (CSPH). This represents the largest single gift ever made to a school of public health. 
CSPH is one of our nation's first schools of public health and is currently celebrating its 75th anniversary. In its recent history, CSPH has distinguished itself on the local, national, and global levels in a variety of public health areas. The Mailman Foundation endowment will help to strengthen and expand areas such as: (1) access to and quality of health care; (2) prevention of childhood poverty; (3) the enhancement of women's reproductive health, including STD prevention services, and reduction in pregnancy-related deaths in developing countries; (4) the identification of environmental factors such as air and water quality as a cause of disease; (5) the prevention of community and household violence; and (6) AIDS research and treatment. 
In addition to these important areas of program and research support, the gift will also be used to provide financial aid to students and for faculty support. 
The family-run Mailman Foundation was created by the late Joseph Mailman, the founder of Mailman Corporation, one of the earliest conglomerates in North America. The Foundation has been an important benefactor to numerous institutions devoted to education, medicine, and the arts. 
I commend the Mailman Foundation for its remarkable act of philanthropy and for recognizing Columbia's leadership in the field of public health. This gift to Columbia University's internationally known graduate school, now known as the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health, will advance the cause of health promotion and disease prevention, through education, research, and direct service.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pride, with my distinguished colleague Senator D'Amato, I introduce the `Kate Mullany Historic Site Act,' a bill to designate the Troy, New York home of pioneer labor organizer Kate Mullany as a National Historic Site. A similar measure introduced in the House of Representatives this year by Congressman Michael R. McNulty has engendered a great deal of support and cosponsorship by over 100 members. 
Like many Irish immigrants settling in Troy, Kate Mullany found her opportunities limited to the most difficult and low-paying of jobs, the collar laundry industry. Troy was then known as `The Collar City'--the birthplace of the detachable shirt collar. At the age of 19, Kate stood up against the often dangerous conditions and meager pay that characterized the industry and lead a movement of 200 female laundresses demanding just compensation and safe working conditions. These protests marked the beginning of the Collar Laundry Union, which some have called `the only bona fide female labor union in the country.' 
Kate Mullany's courage and organizing skills did not go unnoticed. She later traveled down the Hudson River to lead women workers in the sweatshops of New York City and was ultimately appointed Assistant Secretary of the then National Labor Union, becoming the first women ever appointed to a national labor office. 
On April 1, 1998, Kate Mullany's home was designated as a National Historic Landmark by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and on July 15 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton presented citizens of Troy with the National Historic Landmark plaque in a celebration. Given the recent attention to the contributions of Kate Mullany, I am quite pleased to introduce this bill with my colleague Senator D'Amato today.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend to the Senate the stirring tale of Jack Ratz, a New Yorker who recently published a remarkable book, Endless Miracles. Mr. Ratz, who resides with his wife, Doris, in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Mill Basin, is one of the last survivors of the flourishing Jewish community of Latvia, which lost all but 300 of its 35,000 members during the Holocaust. 
Jack Ratz's memoirs is an eloquent refutation to those who would dare to trivialize, distort, or even deny the Holocaust's important lessons. His book well reflects the affirmative message that Jack Ratz shares with New York City school children during his regular visits to the city classrooms. 
As the survivors of the Holocaust succumb to old age there are fewer and fewer eyewitnesses to this tragedy. Jack Ratz has provided an invaluable service with his moving account of the Latvian Holocaust experience.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my friend and colleague Senator D'Amato, a bill that would extend the authorization for the Upper Delaware River Citizens Advisory Committee and authorize the construction of a visitors center. The Upper Delaware is a 73 mile stretch of free flowing water between Hancock and Sparrowbush, New York along the Pennsylvania border. The area is home to the Zane Gray Museum and to Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, which is believed to be the oldest existing wire cable suspension bridge. The Upper Delaware is an ideal location for canoeing, kayaking, rafting, tubing, sightseeing, and fishing. 
In 1987 the Secretary of the Interior approved a management plan for the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River which called for the development of a visitors center at the south end of the river corridor. It would be owned and constructed by the National Park Service. In 1993 New York State authorized a lease with the Park Service for the construction of a visitor center on State-owned land in the town of Deerpark in the vicinity of Mongaup. This bill allows the Secretary to enter into such a lease and to construct and operate the visitor center.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Kirk O'Donnell, succinctly described by Albert R. Hunt in the Wall Street Journal as `one of the ablest and most honorable people in American politics,' died suddenly, much too young, this past Saturday. 
He epitomized the honor and dignity to which all of us engaged in the political life of our Nation should aspire. He served for more than 7 years as chief counsel to then-Speaker Thomas P. `Tip' O'Neill, Jr. He has been active in politics even since, as indeed he was in the years before Washington too. 
I knew Kirk from my earliest days in the Senate. He and his lovely wife Kathy have dined with Liz and me at our home. His cousin, Lawrence O'Donnell, served in my office for many years as chief of staff and as the staff director of the Finance Committee when I became Chairman in 1993. Our thoughts certainly are with Kathy, her children, and the O'Donnell family as they cope with this sudden, terrible news. 
To begin, one must know that Kirk was a fellow Irishman and the great and indispensable achievement of the Irish is that they made it American to be ethnic. On the contribution of the Irish I have written: 
What did the Irish do? First, they stayed in the cities, remaining highly visible. Next, they kept to their faith. Thus the Roman Catholic Church became a major American institution. Then they went into politics. 
Kirk O'Donnell, embodied all of these noble traits. He began his political career in 1970, working on Kevin H. White's campaign for governor of Massachusetts. That bid failed, but when Mr. White later became mayor of Boston, he hired Kirk to run the Fields Corner Little City Hall, in essence, a field station of the city hall. In the words of Speaker O'Neill, `All politics is local' and this grassroots view of Massachusetts, coupled with Kirk's astute political sense, made him an ideal choice when the Speaker needed a new counsel here in Washington. 
It is then that I first came to know Kirk O'Donnell. He was an Irish-American who saw early on the danger of the financial support which some others were providing the IRA. In 1977, Tip O'Neill, Hug Carey, Edward M. Kennedy, and I joined together at Kirk O'Donnell's initiative to oppose such activities. We issued a joint appeal on St. Patrick's Day, 1977, which stated:  
We appeal to all those organization engaged in violence to renounce their campaigns of death and destruction and return to the path of life and peace. And we appeal as well to our fellow Americans to embrace this goal of peace, and to renounce any action that promotes the current violence or provides support or encouragement for organizations engaged in violence. 
Now, finally, one of the oldest conflicts in Europe has the potential of healing and being resolved. A courageous agreement has been reached in Northern Ireland and is being implemented. The United States played a role in reaching this agreement. And the seeds for American support of a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland were sown in the late 1970's, when principled people such as Kirk O'Donnell stood up to say that violence was not the answer to this problem. 
Mr. President it is with great sorrow that I have risen today to thank Kirk O'Donnell for his lifetime of public service and again to offer my sincere condolences to his family.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with the same purpose as my colleague and friend from Nebraska, to thank the Senator from Connecticut for saying what needed saying, and saying it in a manner that gives us hope at a time of profound despond. 
In the aftermath of the President's speech on August 17, I commented that it was not adequate. But it was not until just this moment that the full measure of that inadequacy was presented to us in the context of the needs of the Nation, of the profound moral consequences that will arise not just from what has happened but from what might happen if we do not proceed with the measure of moral compass, but also with a capacity to understand we are all sinners. I say to my friends from Nebraska and from Connecticut, I am the oldest of the three of us and, therefore, have sinned the most. On that you may be sure. 
But we have to resolve this. The Senator did not call for any immediate, precipitous action. We have a process in place--imperfect in so many respects, but in place--and in time, not distant time, a point of decision will come to the Congress, a decision will come to the Congress, and it will be for us to discharge our sworn duty. We take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic--foreign and domestic, sir, which acknowledges that we can be our own worst enemies if we do not hew to our best standards, knowing that we are all imperfect but have an obligation to do our very best. 
In the words of Lord Mansfield in a case heard in London in 1772 (Somersett v. Stewart, 12 Geo. 3), the issue was a profoundly moral one. A man had a slave in England he wished returned to Jamaica to sell. That would have been legal under American law at the time. It was not legal under English law. In an epic statement, Mansfield said, `Fiat justitia, ruat coelum'--`Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.' But it also could be indicated, `If justice is done with sufficient regularity and moderation, the heavens need not fall. They might even rejoice in the nation that has shown a capacity for redemption and self-renewal.' 
So I wish to state my profound gratitude for what you have said and done, and hope we will listen to your wise counsel. I might just say it was in so many ways representative of the very best of our Old and New Testament heritage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I join my revered friend the senior Senator from Virginia in this matter and would begin by reminding the Senate that in the debate on expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, he forcefully made the point that the administration was already talking about a further expansion to the Baltic States. That would be a thumb in the eye of the Russians. The language from the Committee report which Senator Warner has just read implies that the Senate has come to agreement on the matter when it clearly has not. 
Estonia and Latvia have large Russian minority populations and all three have tenuous relationships with Russia. Yet it seems to be working, considering these three independent nations were held `captive'--subsumed by the Soviet Union--for three-quarters of a century. Latvia recently dismantled a Soviet radar station, and there are some accommodations being made for minorities in these nations. 
Expanding NATO to include the Baltics would be provocative in the extreme, as the Russians have made so clear. The Russians who would like to continue to make reforms in their troubled country have said: `Don't do this.' Those leaders who seek the greatest liberalization of Russian society have said `Heavens, don't give this weapon to the enemies of democracy and market enterprise. Don't put us in a situation where nuclear war in Central Europe is not to be dismissed as an outlandish improbability.' 
I remarked yesterday, in a statement supporting the International Monetary Fund replenishment that the situation of the Soviet military is alarming to the point of despair. In Krasnoyarsk, General Alexander Lebed, who is now governor there, has, by reports published in Moscow, undertaken to pay the Soviet strategic forces located in his Krai. The people with their hands on the triggers of the nuclear missiles are not being paid. I suggest the first rule of government is: Pay the Army. In a situation that is unstable, to take this posture regarding Nato expansion is to invite misunderstanding and worse. 
Mr. President, there is nothing we can do to change the report language, but I would like to make the point that it has not been decided that any of the Baltic states should join Nato. I do not think that the term `accelerate the Baltic States integration into NATO'--accelerate: faster than planned--such a term is not appropriate. 
If it were possible in conference for the distinguished chairman and the ranking member to see that this does not become part of the conference report itself or the accompanying statement of managers, I think that would serve stability in Central Europe and the security of the United States. 
I will make no accusations. The Senator from Virginia and I simply say: Do not casually get into a situation that will be thoroughly misread and deeply resented by the people we most want to have as our friends in Moscow. And particularly not on a day when the President himself is there. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see no other Senator seeking recognition, so I respectfully suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the distinguished manager of the legislation and my colleague and friend from Oklahoma for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill before us addresses a matter of the utmost urgency: the need to replenish the resources of the International Monetary Fund. 
Title VI of the bill provides $14.5 billion--the amount of the United States' quota increase--which will augment the general funds available to the IMF. The need for this measure is undeniable: the Fund's resources have been seriously depleted as a result of the Asian financial crisis--specifically, the $36.1 billion in assistance committed to Indonesia, Thailand, and Korea--and now nearly drained by ominous developments in Russia. Not to mention the potential `contagion' effect. The bill also approves the United States' $3.36 billion contribution to the New Arrangements to Borrow--a new fund that will provide additional resources to respond to financial crises of such consequence that they threaten the stability of the international monetary system. Unfortunately, we have entered a period in which crises of such magnitude are upon us. 
Action on the IMF funding request is surely overdue. The President sought these funds in his requested supplemental appropriation for Fiscal Year 1998. The Senate readily agreed, approving the IMF funding amendment offered by the distinguished floor manager, the Senator from Kentucky, by a resounding vote of 84-16. That was on March 26. Regrettably and incomprehensibly, the measure was then dropped in conference at the urging of the House. It is now more than five months later, with no action by the other body, and global financial markets are in yet more precarious positions. 
I spoke this morning with our esteemed Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Rubin, who reiterated the importance of immediate action on this legislation. There is no end in sight to the Asian financial crisis, which began more than a year ago in Thailand. The President today is in Russia, which is on the brink of financial collapse. These events, particularly those in Russia in recent days, ought to convince us that this is not the time to put into jeopardy the IMF as an active participant in world financial matters. 
It is true that the Russian economy is small. As pointed out in Saturday's New York Times, the drop last week in the value of stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange--some $241 billion--was roughly the size of the entire annual output of the Russian economy at present exchange rates. Western Europe's exports to Russia account for well under 0.4 percent of their GDP. And for the United States, the amount is minuscule. Total U.S. exports to Russia in 1997 reached $3.4 billion, a mere 0.04 percent of our GDP. 
But it would be a serious mistake to minimize the potential impact of the current crisis in Russia. As The Financial Times pointed out last weekend, in its August 29-30, 1998 issue, 
Events in Moscow have moved with bewildering speed. The rouble and stock market are plunging, and there is a run on the banks. Most of the reformers seem to be out of the government, replaced by politicians who can be relied on only to set policies to meet the desires of Russia's oligarchs. . . . However, it is already clear that the impact of this crisis will be greatly disproportionate to Russia's size. At worst, the crisis could trigger a new round of contagion, sending western stock markets crashing, and the world into recession . . . 
And yet, the economic consequences of the current turmoil in Russia are not nearly as serious as the potential political consequences, which may have profound implications for the people of Russia--and indeed for the entire globe in this nuclear age. 
For instance, Dr. Murray Feshbach, who warned so presciently in the early 1980s about the troubles afflicting the Soviet Union, continues to document frightening Russian public health problems. The life expectancy of Russian men dropped from 62 years in 1989 to 57 years in 1996. There is no historical equivalent. It has increased slightly in the last year, but remains at appalling levels. A century ago, a 16 year-old Russian male had a 56 percent chance of surviving to age 60. In 1996, a 16 year-old Russian male had only a 54 percent chance of surviving to age 60. Two percent less than he would have had he been born a century earlier! 
The military is not spared the problems afflicting the Russian economy or the health of its citizens. Last month, an army major in central Russia took to the streets with a tank to protest the failure to pay wages. The first rule of government is pay the army. Russian soldiers are reduced to begging for food. The decrepit state of the military leaves Russia, for the most part, undefended. Except, Sir, for nuclear weapons, of which it has over 20,000. 
A recent National Security Blueprint, issued by President Boris Yeltsin on December 17, 1997, is a remarkable document. It is a 14,500-word assessment of Russian national security published openly in an official paper. It acknowledges the ethnic tensions which exist in Russia and notes how the weak economy exacerbates those forces. It states: 
The critical state of the economy is the main cause of the emergence of a threat to the Russian Federation's national security. This is manifested in the substantial reduction in production, the decline in investment and innovation, the destruction of scientific and technical potential, the stagnation of the agrarian sector, the disarray of the monetary and payments system, the reduction in the income side of the federal budget, and the growth of the state debt. 
It goes on to warn: 
The negative processes in the economy exacerbate the centrifugal tendencies of Russian Federation components and lead to the growth of the threat of violation of the country's territorial integrity and the unity of its legal area. 
The ethnic egotism, ethnocentrism, and chauvinism that are displayed in the activities of a number of ethnic social formations help to increase national separatism and create favorable conditions for the emergence of conflict in this sphere.  
Mr. President, the IMF, with its emphasis on economic reform, has a role to play here. Now is not the time to call into question the United States' commitment to that institution. We can debate whether the amounts provided in this bill will be enough. Indeed, a persuasive article in this morning's Washington Post by Susan Eisenhower, chairman of the Center for Political and Strategic Studies here in Washington, states: 
Simply put: The IMF multiyear `bailouts' were enough to obligate Russia to implement Western-designed programs, but not enough to do the job. Total Western assistance to Russia has been a fraction of what West Germany has spent in East Germany since unification. 
It may be time for us to concede that the situation in Russia merits a much more aggressive assistance program, on the order of the Marshall Plan that was so effective in reviving Western Europe. Fifty years ago, from 1948-1952, the United States gave about $3 billion a year to fund the Marshall Plan. A comparable contribution in round numbers, given the current size of the United States economy, would be about $100 billion a year for five years. And yet, the United States' total bilateral assistance to Russia in the five-year period from fiscal years 1992 through 1996 was merely $3.1 billion. 
Certainly the 20,000 nuclear weapons in Russia's hands ought to persuade us that a more serious approach to Russia's economic problems is required. Without question, the first order of business must be the passage of this legislation, to secure funding for the IMF. And after that, we ought to begin a serious debate on what more can and should to be done.  
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.  
Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the unanimous passage of S. 1700, a bill to designate the headquarters of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, located at 451 Seventh Street, SW, as the `Robert C. Weaver Federal Building.' I am proud to offer my tribute to a brilliant and committed public servant the late Dr. Robert C. Weaver, advisor to three Presidents, director of the NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. He was also a dear friend, dating back some 40 years. 
A native Washingtonian, Bob Weaver spent his entire life broadening opportunities for minorities in America and working to dismantle America's deeply entrenched system of racial segregation. He first made his mark as a member of President Roosevelt's `Black Cabinet,' an informal advisory group promoting educational and economic opportunities for blacks. 
I first met Bob in the 1950s when we worked for Governor Averell Harriman. He served as Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York State in 1955, and later became State Rent Commissioner with full Cabinet rank. Our friendship and collaboration would continue through the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations. By 1960, Bob was serving as President of the NAACP. President Kennedy, impressed with Bob's insights and advice, soon appointed him to head the Housing and Home Finance Agency in 1961--the highest Federal post ever occupied by an African-American. 
When President Johnson succeeded in elevating HHFA to Cabinet level status in 1966, he didn't need to look far for the right man to head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development--Bob Weaver became the nation's first African-American Cabinet Secretary. Later, he and I served together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission. 
Following his government service, Dr. Weaver was, among various other academic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, a visiting professor at Columbia Teacher's College and New York University's School of Education, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. When I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard, he generously agreed to be a member of the Board of Directors. 
Dr. Weaver had earned his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard; he wrote four books on urban affairs; and he was one of the original directors of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which designed the plan to rescue New York City during its tumultuous financial crisis in the 1970s. 
After a long and remarkable career, Bob passed away last July at his home in New York City. The nation has lost one of its innovators, one of its creators, one of its true leaders. For Bob led not only with his words but with his deeds. I was privileged to know him as a friend. I think it is a fitting tribute to name the HUD Building after this great man.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Kerrey, with whom I am pleased to cosponsor this Sense of the Senate resolution, has it exactly right. The payroll tax is regressive. The statistic he quoted bears repeating. Among families that pay payroll taxes 80 percent pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. 
If--and I say if--we are going to have a tax cut look no further than the payroll tax. Albert Hunt, writing in today's Wall Street Journal, agrees, noting that for most families it is `the most onerous levy. . ..' 
Even excluding interest income, the Social Security Trust Funds will generate $698 billion of surpluses over the next 10 years. That is just about enough to finance the 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax that Senator Kerrey and I have proposed in our comprehensive Social Security rescue plan. 
In contrast, the operating budget will only have a $32 billion surplus over the next 10 years--and no significant surplus until 2006. 
Finally, maybe we shouldn't be considering any tax cuts. Those surpluses can easily evaporate, even in the absence of a recession. Growth of one percent for the next two or three years --rather than the 2 percent projected by CBO--just about wipes out surpluses for the next several years.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, tonight the United States Senate has prevented a disaster on the Northern border of the United States by passing S. 1360, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997. I am proud to be a co-sponsor. 
On September 28, 1996, the Senate passed the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, a 749-page bill with twenty-four separate titles. One small section of that bill, buried deep in the text, has been the subject of much consternation in northern New York. The provision, known as Section 110, requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to develop a system to document the entry and departure of every alien entering and leaving the United States. Contrary to Congressional intent, the legislative language does not recognize the current practice of allowing most Canadian and American nationals to cross the border without registering any documents. Such an oversight is not uncommon in this type of omnibus bill that is hurried to passage in the final days of a legislative session. 
If implemented, an automated entry-exit control system along the northern border would likely result in long delays at the border, hampering tourism and trade. This is not an inconsequential matter. The United States-Canadian trade relationship is the world's largest, totaling $272 billion in 1995. Compare this to $256 billion in trade with the entire European Union and $188 billion in trade with Japan during that same period. 
The unnecessary border crossing delays which would surely result from the implementation of Section 110 would negatively affect our dynamic trading relationship with our Northern neighbor and would wreak havoc with the flow of traffic at the border. Each year, more than eight million trucks cross the eastern United States-Canada border carrying a variety of goods to market. Additionally, the Eastern Border Transportation Coalition has estimated that 57 million cars crossed that region in 1995. Sixty percent of these were day trips--people crossing the border to go to school or work, attend cultural events, shop, visit friends, and the like. The remaining forty percent of auto border crossings were by vacationers making significant contributions to both nations' economies. Might I note that visitors from the U.S. comprise the largest single group of vacationers in Canada and Canadians are the largest single non-U.S. group of vacationers in Florida. 
It was not the intent of Congress to interfere with the vibrant trading relationship that we enjoy with our Canadian friends. On December 18, 1996, Representative Lamar S. Smith and then-Senator Alan K. Simpson sent a letter to Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chretien to assure him of this fact, writing that `we did not intend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards or I-94's on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.' Thankfully, tonight this ambiguity has been resolved by this body. 
By passing this bill and exempting land border crossings from the automated entry-exit control system created under Section 110, we have prevented what could have been a catastrophe at the Canadian border.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today the Clean Gasoline Act of 1998, a bill to establish a nationwide, year-round cap on the sulfur content of gasoline. My bill presents an opportunity to make tremendous progress in improving our national air quality through a simple, cost-effective measure. Today, 70 million people--30 percent of the nation's population--live in counties which exceed heatlh-based ozone standards. For just a few pennies a gallon, we can make our urban environment appreciably better. 
Sulfur in gasoline contaminates catalytic converters so that they remove less of the nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrocarbons (HC) contained in tailpipe emissions. These pollutants elevate the levels of particulate matter (PM) and contribute to ground-level ozone. By reducing the amount of sulfur allowed in gasoline sold nationwide, my bill will substantially improve air quality, especially in America's largest cities. 
The current average sulfur content in U.S. gasoline is approximately 330 parts per million (ppm), and ranges as high as 1,000 ppm. the Clean Gasoline Act will impose a year-round cap of 40 ppm on the sulfur content of all gasoline sold in the United States. Under my bill, refineries will also have the option of meeting an 80 ppm cap, provided that they maintain an overall average sulfur content of no more than 30 ppm. 
Imposing limits on the sulfur content of gasoline will achieve tremendous--and virtually immediate--air quality benefits. The emissions reductions achieved by lowering gasoline sulfur levels to 40 ppm would be equivalent to removing 3 million vehicles from the streets of New York, and nearly 54 million vehicles from our roads nationwide. 
California imposed a similar cap on gasoline sulfur beginning in 1996, resulting in significant air quality gains. Japan has already established a 50 ppm gasoline standard, and the European Union currently has a gasoline sulfur standard of 150 ppm--which will drop to 50 ppm beginning in the year 2005. 
The gasoline sulfur cap established by my bill will apply year-round. A seasonal cap is insufficient because the damage done to catalytic converters by sulfur poisoning is not fully reversible by typical driving--meaning that vehicle emission controls would be re-poisoned every year when high-sulfur gasoline returned to the market. In the absence of national standards, travel over state boundaries could disable emissions controls. 
The current high-sulfur content of U.S. gasoline will also preclude the introduction of the next generation of fuel efficiency technologies--most notably fuel cells and direct-injection gasoline engines. U.S. citizen will not have access to these advanced technologies--unless we adopt low sulfur gasoline standards. 
Mr. President, I believe our task is clear. A national low sulfur gasoline standard will result in considerable health and environmental benefits. It will maximize the effectiveness of currently available vehicle emissions technology, and will enable the introduction of the next generation of vehicle technology into the U.S. market. Refineries can reduce the sulfur content of gasoline using existing technology that is already being used to supply markets in California, Japan, and the European Union. Our national fleet is already comprised of world-class vehicles. It is time for us to provide this fleet with world-class fuel. I urge my colleagues to join my cosponsors and me in supporting this important legislation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Robert F. Bennett (R-UT) and Christopher Dodd (D-CT) today as original cosponsors of President Clinton's `Year 2000 (Y2K) Information Disclosure Act.' This legislation is intended to promote the open sharing of information about Y2K solutions by protecting those who share information in good faith from liability claims based on exchanges of information. As the President stated in his speech at the National Academy of Sciences on July 14, 1998, the purpose of this legislation is to `guarantee that businesses which share information about their readiness with the public or with each other, and do it honestly and carefully, cannot be held liable for the exchange of that information if it turns out to be inaccurate.' 
The open sharing of information on the Y2K problem will play a significant role in preparing the nation and the world for the millennial malady. I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislation. There is no time to waste.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for eight years Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has battled the military junta in an indomitable, peaceful way which deserves the admiration of us all. For five of these years she was held under house arrest. This is no longer the case, though events of the last week show that her freedom continues to be limited, as is the freedom of all Burmese citizens. 
Last Friday, Aung San Suu Kyi began a journey to meet with members of her National League for Democracy in Nyaungdon township, outside of the capital. She never made it. The thugs who run the military junta blocked her passage. She spent six days in her car surrounded by soldiers who prevented her from crossing a bridge about 30 miles outside of the capital. 
These actions were rightly criticized by many of the foreign ministers attending the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including our own Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. As Keith B. Richburg reported in the Washington Post yesterday, `the foreign ministers of six nations and the European Union confronted a top Burmese official today with a blunt message: No harm must come to the Nobel Peace Prize winner.' I think it is clear that we in the Senate share this sentiment. We hold the leaders of the military junta in Burma responsible for the safety of Aung San Suu Kyi. Period. 
She has demonstrated uncommon restraint and valor in her often tense encounters with the junta. This last week has been no exception. She sat in her car for days, yet when she spoke, she did so firmly and without rancor. She called for dialogue between the NLD and the junta and consistently speaks of upholding the rule of law. She has recently called for the true parliament of Burma--the one elected in 1990--to be convened by August 21. Perhaps this will be an opportunity for the junta to step aside. 
The junta has failed miserably. Burma is a country rich in resources which has been run into the ground by an irresponsible junta. Its elected leaders have been censored, jailed, and worse. The junta has no legitimacy and should step aside and let the rightful and elected government of Burma take control. The people of Burma made clear their preference. Eight years is long enough to wait.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, with regret, I must oppose Senator Daschle's amendment to provide for marriage tax penalty relief. Although I support the idea of a revenue-neutral solution to the inequitable situation created by the Internal Revenue Code for millions of married couples, an appropriations bill is not the proper forum for debating and voting on resolution of this matter. To attach this amendment to this bill would violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the House, and it would kill this important appropriations legislation. 
I agree with the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, that the issue of the marriage penalty should first be considered by the Finance Committee and proceed to the floor in the manner normally associated with tax legislation. I look forward to working with him, and all the members of the committee in coming to a bipartisan agreement on a measure that provides relief to taxpayers saddled with the marriage penalty and is properly offset under the budget rules. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the U.S. Capitol Police--so ubiquitous, so steady, so utterly competent. We take them for granted. Yet every day they defend us, our families, our staff, millions of tourists, ready to lay down their lives. Last Friday, two of them did: Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, each an 18-year veteran, each married, each with children. One in the prime of life; the other, a few short months from retirement. What a tragedy. 
The fact of the matter is that what happened on Friday could happen at any instant. One never knows when. In the crucible of a gun battle, Chestnut, Gibson, and other Capitol Police officers performed their duty in the most exemplary fashion. Chestnut and Gibson made the ultimate sacrifice, laying down their lives to defend others. We can only speculate how many bystanders would have been killed, if not for their--and the other officers'--quick and appropriate actions. 
To the wives and children, other family members, and friends and colleagues of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, our words cannot assuage your grief. But perhaps there is some solace in knowing that these fine two men, killed in the line of duty, have died the most honorable deaths, defending the United States Congress and its most sacred building. They are heroes. Remember, as Pindar wrote, that `the bright gleam of noble deeds moves on with undying voice, ever unquenchable.' And as you struggle to be brave in the days and weeks ahead, know that courage is marked not by the absence of fear, but rather by the presence of faith. May God be with you, and may God be with J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last week marked the 150th anniversary of one of the most important events in our history. 
In July, 1848 a revolution was taking place in a small brick chapel in a village in upstate New York. The first Women's Rights Convention was held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20 of that year. There, a small group ratified the `Declaration of Sentiments,' a document which may be considered the Magna Carta of the women's movement. The Declaration proclaimed that: 
All men and women are created equal: That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
That was the first American political idea--that women are equal in civic rights with men. It did not come from Europe, or ancient Athens, or Rome. It came right from central New York. 
In 1980, we established a Women's Rights Historic Park at Seneca Falls and Waterloo, commemorating this monumental convention. Former Senator Javits and I proposed a bill to create an historic park within Seneca Falls to commemorate the early beginnings of the women's movement and to recognize the important role Seneca Falls has played in the movement. The park consists of five sites: the 1840's Greek Revival home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organizer and leader of the women's rights movement; the Wesleyan Chapel, where the First Women's Rights Convention was held; Declaration Park with a 100 foot waterwall engraved with the Declaration of Sentiments and the names of the signers of Declaration; and the M'Clintock house, home of MaryAnn and Thomas M'Clintock, where the Declaration was drafted. 
Mrs. Clinton visited a number of these sites as part of her `Save America's Treasures' tour. There she spoke to the meaning of the Women's Rights Convention and called for the work of these pioneers to continue into the next century.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my colleagues, Senator D'Amato, and the distinguished managers of the Commerce, State, and Justice appropriations bill. Mr. President, we have in Buffalo a wonderful old theater, known now as Shea's Performing Arts Center. It opened in 1926 as motion pictures made their ascendance in the nation's entertainment industry, and was also the site of numerous stage productions. As Buffalo's population shifted to the suburbs or elsewhere, Shea's fell on hard times and was almost demolished in the 1970s. But citizens banded together, formed a non-profit group, and began restoration efforts. Today Shea's is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a cornerstone of Buffalo's downtown. I would ask the managers of the bill if they would encourage the Economic Development Administration to consider an application from Shea's Performing Arts Center and provide a grant if warranted.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the latest development regarding the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that a critical mainframe computer system used to monitor air traffic will continue to function smoothly into the millennium. The FAA, uncertain as to how long testing would take, only recently began an intensive investigation of its mainframe computers. The testing involved the time consuming task of examining more than 40 million lines of software. Although the technicians determined the date problem could be repaired in time, the process underscores the urgent nature of the Y2K issue. The uncertainties of Y2K mean repair work can be as simple as that of the FAA, or more complicated than is possibly imaginable. It is imperative that the public and private sectors follow the example of the FAA and begin testing their computer systems immediately. I continue to hope that it is not too late to properly prepare for the year 2000.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday, a dear friend and colleague, Representative Thomas J. Manton, announced his intention to retire at the end of the 105th Congress, saying, `I have worked for the citizens of this Nation, New York City, and Queens for most of my adult life.' Indeed he has. Fourteen years as a Member of Congress. Fifteen years before that as a member of the New York City Council. Five years as an officer in the New York City Police Department. And two years as a Marine Corps flight navigator on active duty during Korea. 
His departure is bittersweet for me. I take solace from the fact that he will continue to chair the Queens County Democratic Organization, a post he has held with honor and distinction for the past twelve years. And I am happy that he and his wife Diane will have more time `to enjoy life and travel,' as he put it; to enjoy his four children and--as of July 5th--his four grandchildren. But we here will miss his calm and steady demeanor, and his unwavering commitment to `moderate government,' which is, as Alexander Hamilton observed, the font of real liberty. 
For the most part, I will leave it to others to recite his legislative accomplishments, which are legion. But I would highlight his service as co-chairman of the Congressional Ad-Hoc Committee on Irish Affairs. The bi-partisan Ad-Hoc Committee was established in 1977 to promote peace and justice in Northern Ireland. His interest is natural, for both his parents were Irish immigrants. The task, of course, enormous. But under Tom's steady leadership, the Ad-Hoc Committee made possible implementation of the McBride Principles. And the Ad-Hoc Committee had a huge role in this year's Good Friday Irish Peace Accord. Few men or women have had such positive effect in such a devastated and forlorn part of the world. 
Horace remarked that `We rarely find anyone . . . who, content with his life, can retire from the world like a satisfied guest.' Tom Manton is the rare individual who can retire from Congress like a `satisfied guest.' Godspeed, dear friend.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to correct a glaring competitive imbalance that has arisen because of an anomaly in our tariff schedule. Hickey-Freeman has produced fine tailored suits in Rochester, New York since 1899. Nearly a century. However, the U.S. tariff schedule currently makes it difficult for Hickey-Freeman to continue producing such suits in the United States. 
The facts are straight-forward. Companies like Hickey-Freeman that must import the very high quality wool fabric used to make men's and boys' suits pay a tariff of 31.7 percent. They compete with companies that import finished wool suits from a number of countries. If these imported suits are from Canada, the importers pay no tariff whatever. If the suits are imported from Mexico, the tariff is 11 percent. From other countries, the importers pay a duty of 20.2 percent. Clearly, domestic manufacturers of wool suits are put at a significant price disadvantage. Indeed, the tariff structure provides an incentive to import finished suits from abroad, rather than manufacture them in the United States. 
The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators D'Amato and Specter, would correct this problem, at least temporarily. It suspends through December 31, 2004 the duty on the finest wool fabrics (known in the trade as Super 90s or higher grade--fabrics that are produced in only very limited quantities in the United States. And it would reduce the duty for slightly lower grade but still very fine wool fabric (Super 70's and Super 80's) to 20.2 percent--the same duty as on finished wool suits. The bill also provides that, in the event the President proclaim a duty reduction on wool suits, corresponding changes would be made to the tariffs applicable to `Super 70's' and `Super 80's' grade wool fabric.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. With the recent nuclear tests in South Asia, we are closer to nuclear war than we have been at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is a challenge which will compel the highest attention and the most subtle diplomacy. It requires extensive discussion with India and Pakistan. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has begun such a dialogue. He is a gifted diplomat; however, I must emphasize that despite the considerable talents of the Deputy Secretary, this is an issue which requires the President's close involvement. 
Congress must also be involved in addressing the issues which arise from the nuclear tests in South Asia. Legislation is required to lift the sanctions which these actions triggered. As such, I was pleased that my friend from Delaware, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, has set out a very sensible approach to South Asia. In a recent speech to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Senator Biden challenges us to think anew about South Asia and calls on Congress to provide the President with the flexibility to negotiate in South Asia. This must entail providing him with broad authority to waive the present sanctions. 
Most importantly, Senator Biden calls on the President to make `arrangements to go to India.' This is paramount and I hope that the President will note this wise counsel. The actions which we take to address this volatile situation will have profound repercussion on the future of the subcontinent and the world. Such stakes require the President's active participation. We must talk with them as a matter not just of their survival, but of our own as well. And we must stop supposing that sanctions are the answer. They are not.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the excellent speech on the Year 2000 (Y2K) technology problem given by Senator Bennett at the National Press Club on Wednesday, July 15, 1998. The insightful and informative speech by the Chairman of the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 further advances the work of our committee in bringing this time-sensitive issue to the fore. The speech accurately emphasized the urgent nature of Y2K, and candidly surmised the dire consequences if left uncorrected. I commend Senator Bennett on his efforts to bring increased awareness of the millennium bug to the public and private sectors.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, to introduce a bill to designate the East Northport, New York Post Office as the `Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building.' 
Jerry Ambro's life was one dedicated to serving the people of New York. A Brooklyn native, he was educated in the New York City public schools and was graduated from New York University. After a two-year stint in the United States Army, he began working for the Town of Huntington, New York. He went on to serve on the Suffolk County Board of Supervisors and was elected Town Supervisor of Huntington for four terms. 
First elected to Congress in 1974, in the wake of President Nixon's resignation, Jerry Ambro was a leader among leaders. He served as the chairman of the 82-member New Members Caucus, a reform-minded group that instituted campaign finance reform and new procedures for selecting committee chairmen. The Caucus aided in deposing three committee and subcommittee chairmen. 
As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment, he fought to protect the environment. He prevented the Long Island Lighting Company from converting from oil to coal and he preserved wetlands in Massapequa. As Town Supervisor, he enacted one of the first municipal bans on DDT. 
Following his years in Congress, he went on to serve ably as the Washington lobbyist for then-Governor Hugh L. Carey. He died in 1993 from complications from diabetes. 
I am pleased to introduce this bill today to name a post office after such a distinguished New Yorker. Congressman Gary L. Ackerman has introduced a similar measure in the House. That it has the support of the entire New York delegation demonstrates how widely admired Jerry Ambro was. I urge the swift passage of this legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be placed in the Record.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, President Clinton yesterday called for urgent action regarding the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem in a speech at the National Academy of Sciences. The President stated `This is clearly one of the most complex management challenges in history.' He cited progress in American business and the Federal Government in preparing for the Y2K problem, while simultaneously noting `far too many businesses, especially small-and medium-sized firms, will not be ready unless they begin to act.' 
I am pleased to see that President Clinton is speaking openly about the seriousness of the Y2K computer problem. Over two years ago I stated `that the Year 2000 problem is indeed serious, and that fixing it will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful and coordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the private sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, 2000.' On July 31, 1996 I sent President Clinton a letter expressing my views and concerns about Y2K. I warned him of the `extreme negative economic consequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,' and suggested that `a presidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that all Federal Agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by January 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial and industrial firms doing business with the federal government must also be compliant by that date.' 
I trust the President's acknowledgment of the Y2K issue as a grave and pervasive problem will prompt the agencies and private sector to act quickly. Yet having spent two years studying the problem and warning of the lagging progress of federal agencies in addressing it, I must state that combating the millennium bug at this late date `looks to be the 13th labor of Hercules.' I can only hope that both American businesses and the Federal Government follow the President's warnings and begin to give this problem the attention it deserves.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Yesterday, The New York Times reported that Wall Street firms will turn their clocks ahead today to December 29, 1999, to begin mock trading in the widest ranging Year 2000 (Y2K) test yet by any industry. The tests will investigate what might happen to anyone trading stocks, options, or corporate and municipal bonds on December 30 and 31, 1999, and January 3 and 4, 2000 (January 1, 2000 falls on a Saturday). 
As a member of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology, I am encouraged to see that the financial community is taking the Year 2000 computer problem seriously. On Monday, July 6, Senator Bennett and I held a field hearing in New York to examine the progress of U.S. and foreign financial firms in addressing the Y2K problem. At the hearing, we emphasized the importance of testing, and the need to begin testing by December of this year. Appearing on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the First Vice President Ernest T. Patrikis said that he `does not think it is possible to over-emphasize the importance of testing to help improve readiness.' 
The hearing last week made it clear that Y2K is a serious and pervasive problem confronting the domestic and international economy. The Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of the New York Stock Exchange, William A. Bautz, said that the Securities Industry Association (SIA) refers to solving the Year 2000 computer problem as `the biggest business-technology effort that the world has ever experienced.' 
I am pleased that SIA is sponsoring this industry-wide test and look forward to seeing the results. I only hope that the other industries follow the lead of the financial community and start their testing soon.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise, of course, to support and endorse the proposal by the Senator from Connecticut, cosponsored by the senior Senator from Alaska, with one small anecdote. 
The Women's Rights National Convention met 150 years ago at the Wesleyan Chapel on Fall Street in Seneca Falls. There will be a lot of ceremony this week and next. The First Lady will be there. 
I was in Seneca Falls about 1978 and was having a beer with the county leader, George Souhan, in the Gould Hotel. Looking down at the street, I just happened to say to him, `Where was that chapel where the convention met?' He said, `It was just down the street.' I said, `Let's go look.' Down the street we went. What did we find, but a laundromat. The Wesleyan Chapel had become a laundromat on Fall Street and a garage behind. 
We had it declared a national park in 1980. We went around the city, the village, and found the houses of the ladies of Seneca Falls--the Bloomer girls and Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the like. We went to Waterloo, where in the McClintock House the declaration was drafted. That needs repair; the Park Service should do it. 
It is quite an achievement, but it makes the point that the Senator from Connecticut has just made that you better look after these important sites. That was the first original American political idea--that women were equal in civic rights with men. It didn't come from Europe. It came right from central New York. It had almost vanished as a site until we came along. 
If the Senator wishes to do more, more power to him. I thank my friend from Colorado.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there has been some discussion in the press of late concerning a ruling in Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York involving a business coalition in Manhattan called the Grand Central Partnership. In this case, Archie v. Grand Central Partnership, Inc. (1998 WL 122589, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 3599, S.D.N.Y. 1998), the judge agreed with the plaintiffs who had brought suit against the partnership demanding to be paid at minimum wage rates pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the New York State Minimum Wage Act. The language of the decision reads as follows: 
Despite the attractive nature of the defendants' program in serving the needs of the homeless, the question of whether such a program should be exempted from the minimum wage laws is a policy decision either Congress or the Executive Branch should make. . . . The Court, however, cannot grant an exemption where one does not exist in law. 
Setting aside any personal bias, the judge ruled solely on the basis of law. 
In Bartlett v. New York State Board of Law Examiners (970 F. Supp. 1094, S.D.N.Y. 1997), this same judge ruled in favor of one Marilyn Bartlett, an applicant with a learning disability similar to dyslexia, who sought admission to the State bar. The Board of Law Examiners had denied Bartlett's special accommodation--in this case, an extension of time limitations in which to take the bar examination. The judge found that the Americans With Disabilities Act clearly required the board to provide the accommodation. Again, this decision was made--as it ought to have been made--on the basis of law. Nothing more. 
The district court judge in both of these matters was the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor of the Southern District of New York, who now seeks confirmation from this body for appointment to the Second Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. 
May I take just a moment to thank the distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, and ranking member, Senator Leahy, and the members of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
With confirmation earlier this year of Robert Sack, Chester Straub, and Rosemary Pooler, the judicial emergency in the Second Circuit declared by Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter on March 23 will soon be over. 
It will be over, Mr. President, when Judge Sotomayor is confirmed by the Senate. She has been reported by the Judiciary Committee. 
A little over one year ago, President Clinton nominated Judge Sotomayor to fill a vacancy on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on September 30, 1997 and she was reported out by a vote of 16 to 2 on March 5 of this year. 
Seven years ago, in March 1991, it was my honor to recommend Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the Southern District Court of New York. President Bush placed her name in nomination shortly thereafter and she was sworn in on October 2, 1992. 
The distinguished members of the Committee on the Judiciary were surely impressed with the background and accomplishments of this extraordinary woman. Sonia Sotomayor was raised in the projects of the South Bronx. Her father, Juan Luis, worked in a tool and die factory while her mother, Celina, worked as a nurse. Through discipline and hard work she was graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1976, receiving the university's highest distinction, the M. Taylor Pyne Honor Prize. She went on to graduate from Yale Law School in 1979 where she served as editor of the Yale Law Journal. 
After law school, Ms. Sotomayor joined the New York County District Attorney's office. After more than five years there she moved to the firm of Pavia & Harcourt, attaining the position of partner. She is a former member of the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the New York State Mortgage Agency. All of these achievements are detailed in Ms. Sotomayor's resume which I ask, without objection, be incorporated into my remarks. 
Her service on the Southern District Court has been exemplary. In 5 1/2 years, having presided over 500 cases, she has been overturned only six times. Her decisions are scholarly, well-researched, and well-reasoned. She has presided over cases of enormous complexity with skill and confidence. 
My colleagues will likely recall that it was Judge Sotomayor who put an end to the baseball strike in 1995. Her ruling in Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 246 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) was upheld by the very court she now seeks to join. 
During the course of her confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee, some questions were introduced regarding Judge Sotomayor's position on mandatory sentencing and Federal sentencing guidelines. As of October 1997, in the 217 criminal cases over which she presided, she departed downward a total of 58 times. Forty-four of those departures were at the Government's specific request, because of the defendant's substantial assistance. Excluding such departures, the Judge has departed downward in only 6.5 percent of her criminal cases. The judge has upwardly departed in 6 of her 217 criminal cases, an average of 2.7 percent. 
A recent New York Law Journal article reports on the 1996 sentencing practices of Federal district judges. Comparing Judge Sotomayor's sentencing record to these statistics, it is apparent that Judge Sotomayor is more conservative in sentencing than many of her colleagues on the Federal bench. Her 6.5 percent downward departure rate is below the national average of 10.3 percent, and well below the Second Circuit average of 15.2 percent. Her upward departure rate of 2.7 percent is three times the national average of 0.9 percent. 
Mr. President, we have before us a candidate who embodies all of the finest qualities we could possibly ask for in a Federal judge. She is brilliant, principled and thoughtful. I can see no reason to prolong the process that will lead to her confirmation any further. Surely the time has come for us to act. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I first thank our esteemed chairman for his characteristically generous remarks, and all involved--to agree with him; to point out that this is the first such legislation since the Internal Revenue Service was established under Abraham Lincoln in 1862. Our purpose was to renew the 19th century agency, to invigorate it, and to give to the employees, the public servants, the respect to which they are entitled as public servants. Respect is one of the principal rewards for public service. I hope we have done that with the overwhelming support here on the floor, and the unanimous vote in the Finance Committee. 
Once again, our chairman has managed to bring us together and produce yet another major legislation out of the Finance Committee unanimously, which presents itself so clearly to the entire Senate floor. 
I would not want to close without mentioning again the role of Senators Kerrey and Grassley in the commission that preceded our work, and the staff that did heroic work. I would particularly mention on our side Mark Patterson, and Nick Giordano, whose encyclopedic knowledge, in fact, made our contribution hopefully of substance. 
So concludes a long year's work. I say well done to the chairman. I thank the chairman.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and, from the perspective, if I may, of someone who has been involved with welfare dependency for a third of a century and more, and to make two points, not each of which will give complete comfort to either side of the debate. 
First, to say that when we began to recognize that a different sort of person was finding herself on welfare--which is to say the program which began for widows, and was a temporary bridge program until survivors insurance matured, as old-age insurance matured; and Francis Perkins, who presided over the creation of the Social Security Act, would describe the AFDC program, the typical recipient, as a West Virginia miner's widow, someone who wasn't going to work in the mines, this was a time of depression--this was a person who was left with children and no other source of support. We began to recognize that, more and more, we were getting younger mothers who had never been married, who had never had, either themselves or through a spouse, a relationship to the workforce; and we began to think in terms of vocational education. 
Vocational education was a Federal program. It began in World War I with the idea of training persons for the elementary purposes of providing the skills needed at the time in war industries. That has turned out to be a problematic experiment. Too often it became a way of providing jobs for teachers in vocational education programs, and with no real cumulative effect upon the recipients it was designed to help. However, in that interval I have been engaged in this, 33 years, we have seen something quite remarkable in our educational system, the development of a new level of education called the community college, 2 years after high school, to acquire some specific training, often in complicated tasks for which there is a direct job relationship. That is the way the community colleges have learned to work. They train you at things for which there are jobs. 
Last evening on the Jim Lehrer show we had a quarter hour segment of a community college in Austin, TX, where they are running short of high-tech computer producers and they are taking people in the community college there and they are teaching them about as advanced a degree of production skills as you could imagine--people who work with masks over their mouths lest their breath contaminate the infinitely complex circuitry of the computer chips they are making. This is done with the support of local industries who want those people to be employed and are in need of them and in a hurry for them. 
This is exactly the sort of work program, training program, that takes people off welfare permanently, as much as you can speak so of any individual. It puts them, not just in jobs, but in jobs that require high levels of training for which there is real demand in this economy. To deny that opportunity to young women because they have been on welfare is a form of injustice as well as a self-inflicted wound on the society. 
This is good sense. These are good training programs. These are people who, as the Senator from Kentucky has observed--let them get these 2 years behind them, get into the workforce, and buy Roth IRAs--Roth IRAs. The more the better for the people and the more people with this kind of education the more such purchases there will be. 
Mr. President, I do hope in the interests of good common sense and experience, that this amendment be accepted.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. It has been a pleasure to work with my colleague from Missouri on the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act. Before I discuss the specifics of our bill, however, I would just like to commend the Chairman, Senator Jeffords; the Ranking Minority Member, Senator Kennedy; and the other Committee members for the bipartisan way they have gone about the business of reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. I think they have done an outstanding job. 
It has taken us several years to address the need of institutions of higher education to offer age-based incentives for the voluntary retirement of faculty. In 1990, Congress passed the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBRA) which made early retirement incentives permissible in the context of defined-benefit retirement plans, but did not address the status of such incentives in the context of defined-contribution retirement plans. Defined-contribution retirement plans are most popular with tenured faculty due to their pension portability. The OWBRA did not preclude defined-contribution retirement plans, but by not addressing them at all, it added to the ambiguity surrounding the matter. Functionally, early retirement incentives operate in the same manner for both types of plans. There is continued uncertainty, however, whether early retirement incentives with an upper-age limit that are offered to tenured faculty conflict with the purpose of the ADEA of prohibiting arbitrary age discrimination. 
Inclusion of the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act in the Reauthorization of the Higher Education Act will provide a safe harbor for colleges and universities by clarifying that the early retirement incentives are permitted by the ADEA. Senator Ashcroft and I believe that the faculty retirement incentive provision will benefit colleges and universities, as well as those faculty who choose to participate. As officials for the American Association of University Professors have stated, this provision will `provide greater flexibility in faculty retirement planning, offer a substantial retirement benefit to those professors who choose to retire under the terms of an incentive plan, and leave other professors whole in their choice to continue their careers.' 
Senator Ashcroft and I intended to offer our bill as an amendment to the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, but the Chairman informed us that there is broad support among Committee members for the House-passed provision, and that this issue can be resolved in the Conference Committee.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in the first instance to thank our revered chairman, Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, who brings this measure to the floor with the unanimous vote of the Finance Committee. From the first, ours has been, under his direction, a nonpartisan effort to deal with a nonpartisan issue of the first order of consequence. We are equally, in turn, grateful for the work of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. Senators Kerrey and Grassley of our committee and Congressmen Portman and Coyne from the House side contributed significantly to shaping the concept of the Internal Revenue Service as a customer-based agency, as they put it. 
I believe, sir, that we have done this. We have done it with the aid and the cooperation and the participation of Chairman Bill Archer and ranking member Charles B. Rangel 
of the Committee on Ways and Means in the House, who worked with us on the committee of conference. Senator Roth was chairman. And the result before you is an exceptional piece of legislation--and not an everyday event. 
The Internal Revenue Service became a permanent part of our government in 1862 as part of the Civil War Income Tax Act, which was signed into law July 1, 1862, by President Abraham Lincoln. That was almost a century and a half ago. Yet it was not until just last September that the full Finance Committee of the Senate exercised its oversight jurisdiction to ask, how is this enterprise working and where is it going? The hearing illustrated the need for changes at the IRS and encouraged the thinking on the subject which has produced the measure we bring before you today. 
As evidence of the process already underway by the unanimous confirmation of this body, Mr. Charles O. Rossotti became the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This was a stroke of administrative inspiration by Secretary Rubin, who went out into the private sector looking not for a tax lawyer--an honorable profession; normally the Commissioners of the IRS have been tax lawyers--but instead for an administrator. He found the head of a large company that specialized in information services of a wide variety, and who was prepared to do this as a public service and not to continue in the line that has been of a particular profession, the practice of tax law. 
We have established an IRS oversight board of six private persons, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the representative of the IRS employees, and finally the Commissioner of the IRS itself. The board will be responsible for setting the strategic direction and goals of the agency, while the Commissioner will continue to manage day-to-day operations. The Finance Committee--and then the Senate--specifically voted to include the Secretary and employee representative on the board. 
The conference agreement, which maintained this arrangement, passed the House by a vote of 402 to 8. With the Secretary of the Treasury on the board, the board will know things it cannot otherwise learn. The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury is a world figure. His presence on the board gives it stature within the Government and with the public. The fear was that otherwise it would lapse into a sort of advisory mode that would fail to serve the objectives of this `reform and restructuring' legislation. 
We are pleased that the agreement maintains the position on the board for a representative of the IRS employees. The representative will be able to work cooperatively on the inside rather than working in opposition from the outside. 
An ongoing problem is how to attract top executives to a government activity which has its counterpart in the private sector where compensation--if I may use that term--is often very high, if not indeed exorbitant, because the amounts of money involved are very large. 
So to recognize the disparity between government and private sector salary structures, the conference agreement adopted the Senate provision authorizing the appointment by the Commissioner of up to 40 persons to critical positions for 4-year terms with an annual compensation equivalent to the pay of the Vice President of the United States; that is to say, currently $175,400. These will be persons chosen for their particular skills. They will be there for a 4-year period. They will be departing the private sector for an interval of public service at something approaching the salaries they normally enjoy. 
Other provisions will permit the establishment of a new performance management system focused on individual accountability, and allow for the creation of an incentive award system bringing the IRS into contemporary management modes--out of the model of the civil service that was developed a century ago when we set up the Civil Service Commission, again establishing grades for employees with salaries that were low, but careers that were guaranteed for life. That effort was very controversial at that time. I can record that two Senators from New York State resigned from the Senate when the newly elected President appointed a collector of customs in the port of New York of whom they did not approve. 
One was Roscoe Conkling; the other, Thomas P. Platt. Mr. Conkling was no friend of civil service reform and once observed that when Dr. Johnson declared patriotism to be the last refuge of a scoundrel, he underestimated the potential of reform. 
And yet reform didn't come about, a century passed, and we found that the system had not the internal energies to change itself, to adapt to new technologies and new management modes. We hope the IRS will with these new arrangements--the infusion of new people, and a clear understanding that we expect the system to be open, innovative, and `user friendly,' in the term the chairman frequently used in our hearings. And we shall see. 
There are several other measures, Mr. President. I should point out that the conferees were heroic in their determination not to include all manner of extraneous or narrowly-applicable provisions, as is often the case in a tax bill but is not the case, with very few exceptions, in ours. 
There are two provisions in the conference report, however, that are of special interest to the Senator from New York. The first adopts the Senate provision for a complexity analysis requirement. It requires the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an analysis of the complexity and administrative issues associated with tax legislation reported by the Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee. The provision is intended to provide notice, prior to floor consideration, about provisions that have widespread applicability and may be unduly burdensome for taxpayers to understand and comply with, or difficult for the IRS to interpret and administer, or both. 
I might interject that when this was before us in the Finance Committee, the distinguished chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation said that she looked forward to this, but that she was fearful as to whether the joint committee could begin this complicated effort so long as it was burdened with the task of determining which items in tax legislation were subject to the line-item veto, a detailed and exhaustive analysis of every tax bill, which was a new responsibility for the joint committee. I am happy to say, in the weeks since that exchange took place, the Supreme Court has dutifully and properly declared the line-item veto to be unconstitutional. So one of the unintended consequences--I cannot imagine the Court had this very much in mind--is that the joint committee is now in a position to begin a type of analysis which is new to American legislation. 
We are in the practice of having an increasingly complex Tax Code. There can surely be no question that we are dealing with the problems that we found in the Internal Revenue Service because the Internal Revenue Service has to administer a Tax Code that is frequently incomprehensible. An almost priestly hierarchy understands its meanings and can work them through the tax courts and such like. But to the public and, too, the Congress, they are often simply incomprehensible. 
I remember standing on this floor a year and a half ago with an 800-page tax bill, Mr. President, and that was the only copy of the tax bill on the Senate floor, which we were about to vote for 92-8. A copy provided to the distinguished chairman had been promptly appropriated by the Budget Committee to see if there were any budget points of order, and so the one copy was here on this desk, and Senators on both sides of the aisle would come up and ask whether a provision they had an interest in was in the bill, and I would say, `I hope in good spirit I can find out, but what will you pay me?' Indeed, there was no other way for the Senator to learn. And this is not an unusual event. 
I am going to say this not once but twice because we have to start attending to our own behavior in these matters. I was one of the participants in the enactment of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This was a wonderful, collegial experience led by our good friend and former colleague, Senator Packwood, along with Senator Chafee, Senator Danforth, a `core group,' as we called ourselves, of about six of us. We would meet for coffee at 8 o'clock every morning in Senator Packwood's office, and it would be my job, rather as the dean in a cathedral, to provide a reading for the morning. I would make sure I got the Wall Street Journal early, and without a great deal of effort I would find the advertisements where you would see a little classified ad which would say, `Rocky Mountain sheep, guaranteed losses.' And the Wall Street Journal would tell you how you would be certain to lose money in such a manner that the code would eventually reward you for your losses, which is an interesting game to play if you are interested in C notes but not a very productive form of economic activity. 
Well, we cleaned up that Tax Code. We brought the rates down from, oh, half a dozen income tax rates to 28 percent and 15 percent--two rates. We did `base broadening' as the term was; more and more income became subject to taxation, so the rates of taxation could be lowered. And when it was all over, to our surprise and rather to the consternation of the tax bar, you might say, we had, indeed, produced a fairly simple and comprehensible Tax Code. That was 1986--1986, Mr. President. 
What you have before you, sir, what we have in the Senate before us--and my revered chairman will know this better than anyone else present--we have the 65th public law to amend the Internal Revenue Code since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We have passed 65 tax bills. That comes to about six a year. If you were assigned that task, you would say it would be impossible to achieve; it would be asking too much of our staffs and our Members. But we have done this heroic, if absurd, task, and it has to be said again that simplification is the essence of justice and efficiency in the code. We are a large, complex economy, an international economy. We are not going to have a simple code, but there is no reason we should have an incomprehensible one, particularly when the complexities often reflect the influence of special interest in the code. 
In this regard, not many weeks ago we heard testimony from one of our Nation's most distinguished and accomplished economists, Murray Weidenbaum, who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the administration of President Reagan. I served with him in the administration of President Nixon. At that time he took it upon himself to explain and popularize the idea of revenue sharing--get Federal revenue out to cities and States, let them decide how to spend it, and reduce the dependency on administrative judgments, decisions, and statutes here in Washington. That was a very fine idea which we lost to the budget deficits of the 1980s. 
But Murray Weidenbaum made a powerful point, coming from a powerful mind. He said, if you spend all your income, the American Tax Code is simple. You just fill out a one-page form: I made $50,000 last year, spent $50,000; I made $100,000, I made $100 million--God in heaven knows there are some who do--but I spent it all, and my taxes are as follows. It is only when you begin to save that the Tax Code gets complicated. 
Of course, our largest economic question right now is the rate of savings in the American economy. The fact that we have large trade deficits basically reflects that we are importing capital. We have the lowest savings rate of any industrial country in the world--or any prime industrial country of which I am aware. It is quite striking. I would not argue this is the principal factor, but it is the fact that if you save money you can get in trouble with the Internal Revenue Code. Whatever else, that should not be the case. It is the case. 
I think the complexity analysis, particularly if it is directed with this kind of issue in mind, has the potential of a very important innovation in the development of tax legislation. Don't expect it to change anything in the next 3 or 4 years, but in 20 years' time we might find that this small provision in this large legislation had large consequences. 
One other item. In the interval since this legislation was agreed to, the majority and minority leaders have created a special committee on the year 2000 problem, with a hurry-up reporting date. But during the Finance Committee's consideration of the bill, Commissioner Rossotti specifically noted, in a six-page letter, that some of the changes the chairman has described in such admirable detail would overburden the IRS's ongoing efforts to upgrade its computers to allow for the century date change. In time we came to see the need for the effective-date changes he recommended--and Secretary Rubin reinforced this in a typically succinct one-page letter. We have, in the main, accommodated the Commissioner in this regard. I think this is probably the first statutory recognition of the year 2000 problem, which we are going to know a lot more about in very short order. 
Now, briefly, a few matters of concern. Contrary to the unanimous opposition of the tax profession, this legislation includes a provision that shifts the burden of proof in civil cases from the taxpayer to the IRS. We all live in the real world and no one on the surface would ever think it right that the burden of proof be on a taxpayer, not the Government. But reality can be different. Four former IRS Commissioners, who appeared on a bipartisan panel before the committee, testified that shifting the burden of proof would cause more harm than good to the taxpayer. Similar sentiment was expressed by dozens of professors of tax law. Their concern is that this provision will result in more intrusive IRS audits, create additional complexity and litigation, and create confusion for taxpayers and the IRS as to when an issue needs to be resolved in court and when the burden has shifted. I recognize the political popularity of the provision, but I fear it may actually prove to work against the taxpayer. Be warned--persons who have the best reason to be impartial in their judgment have said this is not going to help, it is going to make things yet more difficult. 
Another provision certain to cause confusion and to lead to additional litigation with the IRS is the expansion of the privilege of confidentiality to tax advice furnished by accountants. This new privilege may be asserted in noncriminal tax proceedings before the IRS and in Federal courts. However, like the current attorney-client privilege, information disclosed for the purposes of preparing a new tax form is not privileged and the conference agreement precludes application of the expanded privilege to written communications to a corporation `in connection with the promotion of the direct or indirect participation of such corporations in any tax shelter.' This is a right that most taxpayers will never be eligible to assert, and many will be surprised to learn about its limitations. 
One provision that the bill does not include, and should, is the correction of a drafting error in the 1997 act which gives a windfall to the few estates in this country with a value of more than $17 million. It costs nothing to fix, and the joint committee estimates that the failure to correct this error would cost taxpayers $900 million in the next 10 years. The Senate bill fixed it. But somehow the conferees could not reach agreement. 
Finally, Mr. President, and possibly most important, I direct the Senate's attention to a modest, but hugely significant, semantic triumph that has been included in this legislation. 
Section 5003 of the conference agreement replaces in U.S. trade law the confusing 17th century phrase `most-favored nation,' which begins with the French phrase `la nation la plus favorisee.' 
We now replace that term with the plain American term `normal trade relations.' This relieves the President and the Congress of the burden of having to ask, why is this typically not-very-popular country being made a most-favored nation? 
Why, for example, is there now a dispute about whether Vietnam should be given most-favored-nation status? Of course, it is not most-favored nation; it simply means you get the same treatment that the most-favored nation, some other nation most favored, gets. It is antique usage that immediately confuses everyone involved, and now we will be able to say we propose `normal trade relations.' It is plain English and avoids the needless misunderstandings that have accompanied that other term. 
I do not want to overburden the Senate with detail, but the most-favored-nation concept is well over 700 years old. It has been traced by historians to a clause in the treaty of November 8, 1226, in which Frederick II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, conceded to the city of Marseilles the privileges previously granted to the citizens of Pisa and Genoa. Not greater privileges, but merely the same. 
The term itself is perhaps a little more recent. The first use that we can come across specifically is in the treaty of 1659 between France and Spain, which guaranteed that the subjects of each sovereign, while in the realm of the other, would be treated as the most-favored nation. Again, the phrase `le plus favorablement,' or in modern French, `la nation la plus favorisee'--having the same rights as were granted the English and the Dutch. 
In the main, the usage has become counterproductive. It confuses the public as to what is being proposed. I think it is fair to say sometimes it confuses the Congress as well, and we are well to be rid of it. I think it is past time and, if I may say, this is a matter that the Finance Committee has had in mind for some while. The distinguished and revered chairman and I introduced legislation last year for this purpose, and now we see it about to become law. 
Mr. President, I thank you for your courtesy, and I have said my piece on the matter. I yield the floor.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I certainly will. I will be succinct, because nothing could be more clear. 
The United States is blessed with a citizenry that pays its taxes on time and in full. There are exceptions, but we do it voluntarily. Technically, we self-assess; we decide ourselves what we owe the government. The rate of compliance is very high. 
Up until just recently, and it is just beginning to change, for example, in the United Kingdom, which we associate with and we think of as a free society, and it certainly is, the subjects of the queen did not decide how much taxes he or she owed; the queen decided. They were sent a bill. You are free to contest it in court, and you can contest it in court the rest of your life, but you still have to pay the bill. 
So the idea of complexity in this system, making it so difficult to know what it is you owe jeopardizes a precious institution, which is the faith of the public in the good intentions and performance of the government itself. That, I think, was one of the reasons the Kerrey Commission called for the reforms that are in this legislation of the IRS. You can have an openness and a sense that things are on the level here and government is doing the right thing.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note with great pleasure that I will have to support the conference committee report for the reason that the Senator from Rhode Island has just stated in response to the question from the Senator from New Mexico. As now provided, absent these technical corrections, we will have existing benefits to veterans taken away. 
I am correct in my understanding, am I not, that there are existing benefits which would be canceled in this way. I am not the least happy about the administration's decision to override the ruling of the general counsel of the Veterans' Administration, but that is history. What we have here is the correction that will really be a clear injustice to a many great persons, never intended by anybody. 
So, Mr. President, I will have to support the conference report and vote for the motion to table.

Madam President, the Maglev Deployment Program in the ISTEA reauthorization legislation contains contract authority of $60 million for pre-construction activities including investment analyses, environmental impact statements and other corridor development activities. The program then provides authorization of $950 million for construction of a project. 
I wish to ask the chairman to confirm my understanding that these pre-construction activities are to be funded in the same fashion as other transportation programs, that is to say, with an 80 percent Federal match. The Federal role in the actual construction program, however, is limited to not more than a two-thirds match. Is that also the chairman's understanding?

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 28, as Congress began its most recent recess, New York City bid a fond farewell to one of County Mayo's finest gifts to our city and nation. 
Paul O'Dwyer, former New York City Council President and champion of countless progressive causes, was a towering figure in our politics for well over half a century, playing a significant role in such disparate movements as the efforts to create a United Ireland and an independent State of Israel, the American civil rights and peace movements and the New York City reform movement that remade the face of our city's politics in the late 1950's. 
From running guns to the Irgun in 1947 to organizing black voters in Mississippi in 1964, Paul O'Dwyer was on the cutting edge of every major social and political issue that shaped our nation's politics. He may have only won two of the dozen elections he contested in his long and colorful career, but his legacy lives on in the lives he touched and the issues he championed. Paul O'Dwyer and I were not always on the same side of every issue. You could question his strategy or even his judgement, but you could never question his abiding integrity or his remarkable capacity to sustain passion about human dignity and equal justice. 
Paul O'Dwyer was born on June 29, 1907 in the Irish village of Behola, the eleventh and last surviving child of Patrick and Bridget McNicholas O'Dwyer. He arrived on our shores in 1925, working on the docks as he went to night classes, first at Fordham University and then at St. John's Law School. 
It is a measure of how quickly he moved through life that he had to receive special permission from Chief Justice Benjamin Nathan Cordoza of the New York Court of Appeals to take his bar exam in 1929, four years after arriving from Ireland and two years before he could receive citizenship or be formally admitted to the bar. As the younger brother of Tammany Hall fixture (and future mayor) William O'Dwyer, he might have easily become a successfully well-connected lawyer. But that was simply not the way Paul O'Dwyer chose to live his life. 
`If I thought at the end of the year that all I did was make a living, I'd regard it as a pretty incomplete year', he once said of his rich life as an agitator within the system. He must, on retrospect, have had paying clients during his 67 years as an attorney, but they were hardly the reason every segment of New York City's diverse political and ethnic spectrum joined in mourning this remarkable individual. 
New York City and our nation are inspired by the quality of Paul O'Dwyer's example and enriched by the legacy of his accomplishments. I ask to have printed in the Congressional Record The New York Times' report on Paul O'Dwyer's funeral.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3130, the Child Support Performance and Incentive Act of 1998. This legislation contains two important components to improve child support collections: a better system of making incentive payments to states for their performance in collecting child support and a new penalty system to help ensure that state child support systems meet basic data processing standards. While both of these components are rather technical, they do represent concrete steps forward and should result in thousands of children--many of them poor--receiving critical financial assistance from absent parents, something all too many poor children do not receive today. 
In addition, the bill contains provisions to improve enforcement of the medical aspects of child support and to help ensure data privacy. These latter provisions we owe to the hard work of my colleagues Senator Rockefeller and Senator Baucus, and I thank them for these improvements to the legislation. 
Mr. President, I urge H.R. 3130 be passed.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, I rise to praise the Constitution, but also appropriately perhaps in this setting, the Senate's foremost expositor and defender of that document, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd, who has today helped write a page in the history of liberty. I mean no less, and I could say no more. 
In 1995, led by Senator Byrd, Senator Levin, Senator Hatfield and others, we pleaded with the Senate not to do this, not to enact this legislation. We said it is unconstitutional. 
That is a large statement. We did not say it was unwise or unseasonal. We said it was unconstitutional. We take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and domestic enemies can arise from ignorance, well-intentioned ignorance. 
This surely was the case, because the bill passed 69 to 31. 
It passed in the face of the clearest injunction from George Washington in 1793 who said, I must sign a bill in toto or veto it. 
Senator Byrd, along with the Senator from New York and Senators Levin and Hatfield, chose, with two Members of the House, to sue the Government of the United States declaring this act to be unconstitutional. The Court held we did not have standing, although two Justices dissented. Justice Stevens, who wrote today's opinion, said in his dissent in that earlier case that we did have standing, and that the measure is unconstitutional. This was so plain to a scholar and a judge. 
I will take just a moment to add and to emphasize Senator Byrd's citations of the writers at the time the Constitution was composed. 
In the Federalist Papers, Madison at one point asks, given the fugitive existence--that nice phrase--of the Republics of Greece and Rome, why did anybody suppose this Republic would long endure? Because, it was answered, we have a new `science of politics.' The ancients depended on virtue to animate the people who govern. We have no such illusions. We depend on the clash of equal and opposed opinions and interests--the conflict of opposings interests and the separation of powers, those two fundamental ideas. And we wrote them into the Constitution: article I, the legislative branch; article II, the executive branch. And the court decisions in this matter, too, have hearkened back to those early times. 
I was struck by the opinion written by Judge Hogan, who earlier this year was the second judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to hold this statute unconstitutional. He cited Edward Gibbon, whose `Decline and Fall' was published in 1776. 
Here is Gibbon's passage as cited by Judge Hogan: 
The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost when the legislative power is nominated by the executive. 
And that is exactly the direction we were moving in. 
Justice Kennedy, in this morning's opinion, quoted a passage from the Federalist Papers in which Montesquieu, in the `Spirit of the Laws,' is cited: 
When the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body, there can be no liberty. 
Liberty is what Senator Byrd was talking about. Liberty is what was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States today, and liberty is what was put in jeopardy, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, by this body, by the other body, and by the President who signed the bill. 
Liberty was put in jeopardy. Liberty has prevailed. 
Let us learn from this. Let us not just let it go by and think nothing happened. Something did happen. A smallish group opposed it, took it to court, were rebuffed, took it to court again. We were there as amici and prevailed. But had we not, what would have happened? Had Robert C. Byrd not been here, what would have happened to our liberties? Not to our budget. These are inconsequential things compared to that fundamental. 
And so, sir, I rise to express the honor I have felt in your company and hope that history will long remember and largely note what was done today in the Court at the behest of the sometime majority leader, the distinguished upholder of our Constitution, Robert C. Byrd. Not as a man but as a man speaking for the ideas and principles on which the Constitution of the United States is based. 
Finally, sir, I express thanks to our counsel, Michael Davidson, Lloyd Cutler, Alan Morrison, Charles Cooper, and Louis Cohen--some of the finest attorneys in our country--who have helped us with this matter, and have generously done so on a pro bono basis. Professor Laurence H. Tribe at the Harvard Law School, and Dean Michael J. Gerhardt of Case Western University School of Law, were also of great assistance, as were others. 
I celebrate the moment and yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a milestone will occur on Tuesday, July 7th, which I do not want to go unacknowledged: Ellen Bennett Kantrowitz, a remarkable New Yorker, will celebrate her 80th birthday. 
Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz is a native of Queens, New York. She married Matt Bennett of Brooklyn, New York and had four children: daughter Pat, and sons Bill, Mike and Matt. Today they all have achieved much success which they attribute to the guidance provided by their strong mother. Pat is a program assistant with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in Reston, Virginia. Bill is a Long Island businessman. Mike is News Director of WHUD/WLNA in Peekskill, New York. Matt is a partner in a Goshen, New York law firm. 
Forty years ago, a tragic accident claimed the life of Matt Bennett. The lawsuit which followed led Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz to enlist the help of New York lawyer Moses Kantrowitz. Seven years later, the pair were married. For twenty three years this couple lived happily, continuing to promote and sustain the strong family bonds which characterize the Bennett Kantrowitz family, until Moses Kantrowitz's death in 1989. 
Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz is the matriarch of a large and loving family, one which extends throughout the state of New York from Huntington, North Babylon, Massapequa, Selden, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island to Upstate, Monroe, Highland Mills, Central Valley, Newburgh and Beacon. She remains steadfast in her dedication to her children, grandchildren and great-children, undeterred by age and ailment. 
As Ellen Bennett Kantrowitz turns 80 she will be surrounded by family at a celebration July 4th weekend in Monroe, New York. With appreciation and admiration I take this opportunity to congratulate her on her 80th birthday, and wish her many more.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations on the occasion of the 150th Anniversary of the oldest Catholic church in continuous existence on Staten Island, the Church of St. Joseph-St. Thomas. Evolving out of a small Catholic community in Rossville, the church has improved New York's quality of life for generations and is an integral part of the Staten Island community. 
The impact this parish has had on its community is remarkable. Both in times of prosperity and in times of despair, the contributions of the pastors and congregants of St. Joseph-St. Thomas have profoundly affected the residents of Staten Island. The parish has provided education for children, held community gatherings and helped the disadvantaged. 
The leaders of St. Joseph-St. Thomas have been responsible for much of this tradition of community involvement. Though I will not name all of the former pastors here, I would like to mention two. Father Edward A. Dunphy's established child-care programs for immigrants during the 19th century. These first Catholic child-care facilities helped maintain the devotion to Catholicism within Staten Island's immigrant community. During the Great Depression, Father Thomas S. Magrath cut church expenses to relieve parishioners' fiancial burdens. All the while, he developed projects and programs to feed and shelter the suffering. 
Today this spirit of helping those in need lives on with Monsignor Peter G. Finn and the church's involvement in such programs as Project Hospitality and the St. Vincent De Paul Society. 
With appreciation and admiration I extend my best wishes to the Church of St. Joseph-St. Thomas. Its 150th Anniversary is cause for much celebration and anticipation of even greater accomplishments to come.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, President Clinton long ago announced his intention to veto the Education Savings and School Excellence Act. For reasons I will describe in a moment, I oppose this bill and agree with the President's decision to veto it. 
However, apart from the merits of the legislation, I do want to thank Chairman Roth for insisting that the appropriate place for initial consideration of the Coverdell legislation was in the Finance Committee, not on the floor. This legislation was reported by the Committee on February 10, 1998, by a vote of 11-8. 
This is one of those infrequent occasions in which Chairman Roth and I disagree on a policy matter. The good intentions of the proponents of expanding the availability of education individual retirement accounts are clear. However, in my view the proposed changes to the education IRA provisions, passed just last July and effective on January 1 of this year, are fraught with serious policy and technical defects. Secretaries Rubin and Riley have expressed strong opposition to the education IRA provisions in this bill, and President Clinton agrees with their recommendation that he veto this conference agreement. 
In a letter to members of the Finance Committee dated February 9, 1998, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Education stated that the education IRA provisions in this bill would disproportionately benefit the most affluent families and provide little or no benefit to lower and middle-income families. In addition, they indicated that the provisions `would create significant compliance problems.' In a letter to Speaker Gingrich dated June 16, 1998, President Clinton states `If the conference report on H.R. 2646 is presented to me, I will veto it because the A+ accounts that it would authorize are bad education policy and bad tax policy.' 
Treasury Department analyses conclude that 70 percent of the tax benefits from this provision would go to the top 20 percent of all income earners. In a memorandum of March 2, 1998, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 52 percent of the tax benefits of the enhanced education IRA provision would to 7 percent of taxpayers: those with dependents already enrolled in private primary or secondary schools. The Joint Committee memorandum indicates that the per tax return benefit for taxpayers with children in private schools will be five times greater than the benefit to taxpayers with children in public schools. 
This bill will not result in greater opportunity for middle and lower income families to send children to private schools, as supporters contend. Instead, it will merely provide new tax breaks to families already able to afford private schools for their children. If the proponents are truly concerned about the middle class, the tax benefits should be targeted there. In order to accomplish this, the income limits would have to lowered, and the ability to circumvent those limits would have to be prevented. 
Nor will this legislation result in an increase in national savings. The expansion of the education IRA will provide further incentives for taxpayers to shift money to tax-favored accounts, and to spend funds that would otherwise be used for retirement. 
Further, the additional complexity these new provisions would add to the Internal Revenue Code is of real concern. Taxpayers are just beginning to become aware of the hundreds of changes made in the 1997 tax bill. And now we are considering additional changes to a provision that became effective on January 1, 1998. More confusion for taxpayers; a boon for H&R Block. 
A week after a vote in the House to terminate the Internal Revenue Code for among other things its mind-numbing complexity, we have before us a bill that would create a maze of rules in attempting to define what constitutes as `qualified elementary and secondary education expense.' For example, the bill defines such expenses to include computers and related software and services, but how is the IRS to monitor whether a computer (or the use of the Internet) is used by a child for educational purposes or for entertainment, or by the child's parents for unrelated purposes? 
Under this bill, the ability to contribute up to $2,000 per year in an account for elementary and secondary education expenses would sunset after 2002. However, money contributed through 2002 could still be used for such expenses. There will be different rules depending on whether contributions were made in 1998, 1999 to 2002, or post-2002. It will be up to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when funds were contributed, the earnings on those funds, and whether they can be used for only higher education, or both elementary and secondary education and higher education. Who will understand these rules? 
Mr. President, we are already spending enough on IRAs and other tax-advantaged savings vehicles. At a cost of $40 billion over 10 years, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created the Education IRA and the Roth IRA, and significantly expanded existing IRAs and the tax benefits of State-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans. 
Having said all of that, I must also express continued bewilderment at the opposition by the House of applying the income exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, which is section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, to graduate students. The conference agreement extends the income exclusion for undergraduates, but once again fails to restore such treatment for graduate studies. 
Section 127 is one of the most successful Federal education policies we have. A million persons per year are provided tax-free higher education by their employers; about a quarter of those are students enrolled in graduate-level education courses. 
In a world of continuing education, section 127 permits an employer to send an employee to school to learn something new, get a degree, and bring the skills back into the workplace. The employee gets more income, and the Federal Treasury gets more tax revenue. This is a program that works, and it administers itself. 
This is a repeat of what took place last year. The Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would have made this absolutely easy; it made section 127 permanent for both undergraduate and graduate study. For reasons I will never understand, the Senate language was dropped in conference. 
Finally, I appreciate Chairman Roth's good faith efforts in working with members on both sides to try and come up with measures designed to address the issue of school infrastructure. Last year, Senators Carol Moseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the issue of crumbling schools to our attention, and they continue to be the leaders in the effort to address this serious problem. Most of use would prefer not to address this issue via the Tax Code, but previous attempts at more direct solutions have been opposed. I am afraid that such opposition has resulted in the nominal tax provision we find in this bill to address a problem that is estimated to cost at least $112 billion--a figure that does not include the cost of building new schools.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to report to the Senate that on June 18, 1998 in Geneva, at the conclusion of the 86th International Labor Conference, the International Labor Organization adopted by an overwhelming margin an important new `Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.' The vote was 273 in favor of the new Declaration, zero opposed, with 43 abstentions. The adoption of this measure is a singular achievement and holds great promise for advancing core labor standards in the international community. 
Our distinguished Secretary of Labor, the Honorable Alexis M. Herman, deserves much credit, as does Andrew Samet, her able Deputy Under Secretary for International Labor Affairs. Over the last three weeks, Secretary Herman energetically pursued this agreement throughout difficult and long negotiating sessions, and in critical corridor side-bars. Ultimately, she succeeded. 
Secretary Herman has characterized the new Declaration and its follow-up mechanism as `a big step forward for the ILO and its members as we enter the 21st Century.' In the statement that she issued on June 18, 1998, upon the adoption of the new Declaration, she said: 
With the passage of this declaration, the ILO underlined and clarified the importance of the fundamental rights of workers in an era of economic globalization. It firmly demonstrates that we can and will move forward in an effort to see trade and labor concerns as mutually supportive--not mutually exclusive. 
Another of the United States' Delegates to the International Labor Conference, AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, called the Declaration `an historic breakthrough that dramatically underscores the importance of basic rights for workers in the global economy.' And to emphasize the tripartite nature of the ILO, it should be noted for the record that the U.S. Council for International Business, which is the United States' employer representative to the ILO, was a principal supporter of this new initiative, and has been from the beginning. The Council's President, Abraham Katz, called the new Declaration `a major achievement for the ILO.' 
In essence, the ILO has bunbled together, in a single declaration, four sets of fundamental rights--the core labor standards embodying the broad principles that are essential to membership in the ILO. Having declared that those rights are fundamental, the document then provides for a monitoring system--a `follow-up' mechanism, to use the ILO's term--to determine how countries are complying with these elemental worker rights. 
The four sets of fundamental rights are: (1) Freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (2) the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; (3) the effective abolition of child labor; and (4) the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
These rights flow directly from three sources. First, from the ILO Constitution itself, which was drafted by a commission headed by Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor and became, in 1919, part XIII of the Treaty of Versailles. Second, from the immensely important Declaration of Philadelphia, which reaffirmed, at the height of World War II, the fundamental principles of the ILO, including freedom of expression and association and the importance of equal opportunity and economic security. Adopted in 1944, the Declaration of Philadelphia was formally annexed to the ILO Constitution two years later. And, not least, these four groups of core labor standards flow from the seven ILO conventions that are recognized as Core Human Rights Conventions. 
These seven conventions are not the highly technical agreements that make up the vast majority of the ILO's 181 conventions. Rather, they directly address the rights of working people. 
They are: 
No. 29--the Forced Labor Convention of 1930; 
No. 87--the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right; to Organize Convention, 1948; 
No. 98--the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949; 
No. 100--the Equal Remuneration Convention of 1951; 
No. 105--the Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, 1957; 
No. 111--the Discrimination in Employment and Occupation Convention of 1958; and 
No. 138--the Minimum Age Convention of 1973. 
They are extraordinary conventions. The Social Summit in Copenhagen in 1995 identified six of these ILO conventions as essential to ensuring human rights in the workplace: Nos. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, and 111. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has classified them as `International Human Rights Conventions.' The Governing Body of the ILO subsequently added to the list of core conventions Convention No. 138, the minimum age convention, in recognition of the importance of matters relating to child labor. These conventions embody the broad principles that are basic to membership in the ILO. 
But what makes this year's Declaration so significant, Mr. President, is its second component--the monitoring mechanism, the element that will, if implemented properly, ensure that something will come of all this. For example, the follow-up mechanism will take a look at how China is doing on prison labor, how Pakistan is doing on child labor, how the United States performs with respect to freedom of association. Yes, we will be examined, too.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate takes an important step in the search to unfold the events of the holocaust by adopting the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. This bill requires the disclosure of classified information, currently held by the United States government, regarding individuals who participated in Nazi war crimes, and stolen assets of the victims of Nazi war crimes. The bill also requires a government-wide search of records to ensure the release of as many relevant documents as possible. 
Researchers seeking information on Nazi war criminals and the assets of their victims will have unprecedented access to relevant materials in the possession of the United States government, which until now have remained classified. It is my view that these documents have been held far too long. Well beyond the time when their disclosure might have posed a threat to national security--if indeed such disclosure ever did. 
While reviewing relevant material for declassification, officials will be required to maintain a strong presumption that relevant material should be declassified. This is based on the `balancing test' included in the bill which presumes that the public interest in the release of Holocaust records outweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected to result from disclosure. This provision is in keeping with the Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy which recommended that such a balancing test be applied in all classification decisions. 
With the passing of time it becomes ever more important to document Nazi war crimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. The greater access which this legislation provides will add clarity to this subject. I applaud those researchers who continue to pursue this important work. Those who suffered from the Holocaust are reaching the end of their life-span. We owe it to them to make available as much information about that terrible period as possible. This is our solemn task.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senator Kerrey and I, along with Senators Breaux and Lieberman, are pleased to introduce the Social Security KidSave Accounts Act, which nicely complements the Social Security Solvency Act of 1998 introduced by Senator Kerrey and me in March. In that proposal we reduced payroll taxes by $800 billion over 10 years. The reduction in the payroll tax rate from 12.4 percent to 10.4 allows the funding of personal savings accounts with the 2 percentage point reduction in the payroll tax. 
A worker with average earnings depositing 2 percent of wages--one percent from the worker and one percent from the employer can--over 45 years--accumulate almost one half of a million dollars. Add in the wealth generated over a lifetime of 70 years from the interest on the KidSave accounts of $3,500--$1,000 at birth and $500 for each of the next five years--and you have created a new class of millionaires. Workers will have estates which they can pass on to their heirs. 
Combined, these two bills create wealth without spending the budget surplus. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for the ten year period 1999-2008, our bill, which saves Social Security indefinitely, increases the budget surplus by $170 billion. This KidSave bill spends only about $100-$120 billion of that increase. In short, we create private savings without reducing public savings. 
Together these bills provide for a more comprehensive approach to retirement savings. The foundation of this approach remains Social Security, the financial future of which is secured for 75 years and beyond. If this legislation is enacted, as I hope it will be, significant new private savings would be added to this foundation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of a celebration being held later this evening in New York's historic Gracie Mansion. New York City's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his wife Donna Hanover will be joining the America-Israel Friendship League and the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York in hosting a gala dinner celebrating the State of Israel's Golden Jubilee. It is most appropriate that the city with the largest Jewish population in the world is hosting this official celebration of Israel's fiftieth anniversary. 
The members of the Senate are familiar with the important work of the America-Israel Friendship League (AIFL), a national, non-sectarian organization committed to maintaining and strengthening the historic, mutually supportive relationship between the peoples of the United States and Israel. Founded in 1971, the AIFL's activities generate bi-partisan support in reaching out to our citizens of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds in an effort to educate Americans and Israelis about the common interests they share. With a membership and leadership comprised of political, religious, labor, business, and community activists of all faiths, the diversity of the AIFL's membership makes its efforts even more extraordinary. The distinguished publisher Mortimer Zuckerman currently serves as the League's president, one of New York's leading attorneys Kenneth Bialkin serves as chairman of the board, and the talented Ilana Artman is the League's executive vice president. 
As a non-sectarian, people-to-people organization, the AIFL is devoted to fostering cultural and economic ties between the United States and Israel and to strengthening the unique friendship between our country and the only democracy in the entire history of the Middle East. Throughout Israel's first half century. the people of Israel have struggled to survive in a hostile region. Enduring five wars, they have most recently embarked on an historic journey in search of peace. 
The United States' support for Israel is grounded in an appreciation of the shared values and principles that are at the foundation of American and Israeli societies. Israel is the only country in the Middle East that, like the United States, is founded on the rights and privileges that guarantee a free society: elected government; freedom of speech; freedom of the press; an independent judiciary; and the rule of law. There have been just fourteen free elections in the entire history of the Middle East: all fourteen have been held in the State of Israel since 1948. 
To promote the unique friendship between these two great democracies, the AIFL has successfully mobilized a coalition of Americans of all ages and backgrounds to participate in a broad range of cultural and educational programs. Three of our most revered former members--Frank Church, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits--played major roles in creating the League in 1971, and I can testify to how strongly they believed in the League's mission and responsibilities.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I offer a resolution which speaks to many of the issues now facing the Tibetan people in their long struggle. This has been threatened for a half-century now, but there are efforts underway to resolve these issues. This resolution puts the Congress on record in support of these goals. 
Begin with the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), which has closely followed the situation in Tibet since the Dalai Lama was forced to flee into exile. In 1959, 1960, and 1964, the ICJ examined Chinese policies in Tibet and reported its findings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The 1960 report made the important international legal determination that `acts of genocide had been committed in Tibet in an attempt to destroy the Tibetans as a religious group . . .' and concluded that Tibet was at least `a de facto independent State' prior to 1951. 
Now the ICJ has returned to the issue of Tibet and produced another important report. It finds that repression in Tibet has increased since 1994. This is an assessment which my daughter Maura shares after having visited Tibet and having worked closely for many years with Tibetan refugees who continue to make the dangerous journey over the Himalayan mountains to flee persecution in their homeland. 
In 1996 she returned from Tibet to report,  
. . . in recent months Beijing's leaders have renewed their assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with and alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama. 
The Dalai Lama, of course, remains unstained, but it is time for the Chinese to consider a policy of `constructive engagement' of their own--with the Tibetans. The recent ICJ report calls on the People's Republic of China to enter into discussions with the Dalai Lama or his representatives on a solution to the question of Tibet. Mr. President, for many years now, the United States Congress has been calling for exactly this. I hope that while the President is in China, he will be able to convey the importance of this issue to secure a commitment from the Government of the People's Republic of China to begin such discussions with the Tibetans. 
In 1979, Deng Xiaoping stated that `except for the independence of Tibet, all other questions can be negotiated.' The Dalai Lama has repeatedly stated his unambiguous willingness to begin substantive negotiations with the Chinese without preconditions, and that the issue of independence need not be on the agenda. This is not a concession easily made by the leader of the Tibetan people who, as the ICJ concluded in 1960, enjoyed de facto independence before the Chinese take-over. Nonetheless, he has made the offer sincerely, and repeatedly, and deserves a sincere response. 
The United States can help elicit such a response. In addition to the opportunity posed by the upcoming visit by the President, we now have a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Gregory B. Craig, whom Secretary Albright appointed to achieve just such a result. A special coordinator is something that our beloved Claiborne Pell proposed in the 103d Congress and I am glad we have been able to achieve another one of his aspirations. Having a Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues will better enable the Administration to facilitate a dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. 
Finally, Mr. President, atheists are rarely involved in choosing divine leaders, but the Chinese Communist Party has not only involved itself in the selection of the eleventh Panchen Lama, but Chinese officials have asserted that it is the party's sole right to make the selection, and they have detained the boy the Dalai Lama recognized as the next Panchen Lama. This resolution calls attention to this odious infringement on religious freedom. 
The Tibetans--I think I am correct in saying--above all value their ability to practice religion. Religion infuse every aspect of Tibetan culture. We cannot begin to comprehend the affront to Tibetans of having an important religious figure detained and declared illegitimate by the Communist Party. Add to that affront that another boy is produced by the Party and proclaimed as the religious leader. 
This resolution calls for the release of 9-year old Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the boy selected by the Dalai Lama as the next Panchen Lama, who has been under detention for 3 years. 
The Senate has always maintained strong support for the Tibetan cause. This resolution continues that tradition. I especially wish to thank my colleague, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, for his outstanding leadership on this issue. We are also joined in this effort by Senators Leahy, Mack, Wellstone, and Feingold. I thank them for their support.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today a unanimous Senate will state in clear and simple terms that we will no longer abide by the discrimination faced by Israel at the United Nations. I speak of the fact that Israel is excluded from a United Nations regional group. Israel is the only one of the 185 member states of the United Nations barred from membership in a regional group. The United Nations member states have organized themselves by regional groups since before Israel joined the United Nations in 1949. Membership in a United Nations regional group confers eligibility to sit on the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, as well as other United Nations councils, commissions, and committees. 
For the first time, the Senate provides notice of its intention to work to end this Cold War anachronism. One sorry throwback to an era when the institutionalized isolation of Israel was a given in international affairs--the ugly `gentlemen's agreement' that excludes Israel and only Israel from membership in any United Nations Regional Group. Israel, and only Israel, can never sit on the United Nations Security Council. Israel, and only Israel, can never serve on the United Nations Economic and Social Council, where her expertise is so sorely missed. Israel, and only Israel, is less than a full member of the very international organization which bravely voted on November 29, 1947 to create it. 
Today we call for Israel's admission to a United Nations Regional Group. This must be a goal of our government's foreign policy and a priority of reform efforts at the United Nations. That such legislation is necessary is a reminder that, despite the unparalleled success of the Zionist movement in its first hundred years, the state created half a century ago, as the fruit of this ideal, still requires support from its friends to overcome this institutional prejudice. 
It is a fitting tribute to this vision that our country will take its rightful place in the forefront of the effort to allow Israel to participate fully in international affairs and to be counted as a legitimate member among the nations of the world. I am joined in this effort by 54 cosponsors. I thank my colleagues for their support and in particular the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, for his leadership.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today is a bittersweet day at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City where the annual commencement ceremony will include an unprecedented presentation of a posthumous honorary doctorate to Mordechai Strigler, the talented editor of the Yiddish Forward who died last week at the age of 76. 
I rose almost a year ago today to share with the Senate the news of the Forward's centenary. This remarkable newspaper, which once helped hundreds of thousands of new immigrants learn about their new homeland, now prints Yiddish, Russian and English weekly editions. The Yiddish edition has gone from a daily press run of 250,000 copies to a weekly run of 10,000, but has retained much of the literary excellence and social conscience that has so characterized the Forward during its storied history. 
Mordechai Strigler was born in 1921 in Zamosc, Poland, and was sent to study in a yeshiva at age 11. In 1937 he began work as a rabbi and teacher in Warsaw. 
When the Germans occupied Poland in 1939, he tried to escape to Russia, but was caught at the border. He spent a few months at the Zamosc ghetto with his parents and then five years in several concentration camps. In Buchenwald, he was a member of the Resistance and served as a covert teacher for the children incarcerated there. He was liberated on April 11, 1945. 
After the war, he began writing furiously and prolifically for the next 53 years until his death. He chronicled the slave-labor camps and death factories in a six-volume Yiddish series called `Oysgebrente Likht', which means `Extinguished Candles'. 
In 1955, Strigler published two volumes called `Arm in Arm with the Wind,' a historical novel about Jewish life in Poland in the 17th and 18th centuries. 
His newspaper career began in Warsaw just before the war and flourished in Paris after the war. In France, he served as editor of Unzer Vort (Our world), a Yiddish daily. 
While in New York, he was offered the editorship of the Kemfer, a position he held until 1995. He published such classic Yiddish writers as Abraham Reizen, H. Leivik, Chaim Grade, and Jacob Glatstein. 
In 1978, Strigler was awarded the Itzak Manger Prize in Jewish Literature, one of the most distinguished prizes in the field. 
He became editor of the Yiddish Forward in 1987, following the retirement of Simon Weber, and he remained at its helm until last month. 
`The death of Strigler marks not only a sad transition for his colleagues in the Yiddish, Russian, and English editions of the Forward but also a milestone in the area of Yiddish-language journalism and the literature of the Holocaust,' the English-language Forward said in an obituary.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some while ago it was announced that the German publishing firm of Bertelsmann had purchased Random House, the legendary New York publisher founded in the 1920s by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. The brilliance of the authors published over the years was exceeded only by that of the young editors that gave their works such superb attention. One of these was Jason Epstein. It was my great fortune to have him as an editor of three books which Random House published--`Coping: On the Practice of Government,' `The Politics of A Guaranteed Income,' and, with Frederick Mosteller, `On the Equality of Educational Opportunity.' These were wonderfully produced, no less wonderfully edited--500 or more pages each. Thereafter, they were marketed with what I can only think of as loving care. The subjects were anything but reader friendly, as you might say, but Random House was author friendly and American letters are profoundly in its debt. Recently, in the April 6 issue of the New Yorker, The Talk of the Town began with a wonderful reminiscence by Jason Epstein of his early years at Random House. I ask that it be printed in the Record. 
From the New Yorker, Apr. 6, 1998   
Ink--Can the Bertelsmann Deal Take Publishing Back to Its Roots? 
On the morning last week that the purchase of Random House by Bertelsmann was announced, I happened to pass the office of my colleague Bob Loomis and noticed the framed copy of the Random House interoffice phone directory for 1958 that Bob keeps on his bookshelf. The directory is about the size of a postal card and lists some ninety names, including Bob's and mine along with those of Bennett Cerf and his partner Donald Klopfer, the founders of Random House, whose offices were then on the parlor floor of the old Villard mansion, on Madison and Fiftieth. We occupied the north wing. The Archdiocese owned the central portion, which is now the entrance of the Palace Hotel, as well as the south wing, which now houses Le Cirque 2000. 
Loomis and I joined Random House in the late nineteen-fifties. Though we took our publishing responsibilities seriously, we did not think of ourselves as businessmen but as caretakers of a tradition, like London tailors or collectors of Chinese porcelain. Bennett Cerf set the tone, and it was his habit to run from office to office sharing the jokes he had just heard over the phone from his Hollywood friends. Several times a day Bennett interrupted meetings between editors and authors in this fashion. Some authors were delighted. But I remember an afternoon when a baffled W.H. Auden asked if we could finish our conversation at Schrafft's across the street. This was, I believe, the last time he set foot in the Random House offices. 
For me in those years, book publishing seemed more a sport than a business--a sport that required skill and strict attention to the rules, especially the rule that we had to make enough money to stay in the game. But if we wanted to make real money in a real business we knew that we should forget about afternoons with Auden, Faulkner, and Dr. Seuss and go down to Wall Street. But this was unthinkable. It was always a pleasure when one of our books became a best-seller, but what counted more was a book that promised to become a permanent part of the culture. Random House published many books that became both. 
The editor's job was different then from what it is now. Now layer upon layer of marketing specialists, sales executives, and business managers separate the editor from the bookseller. At the Villard mansion, we made these publishing decisions ourselves. For years, I would begin my day in the mailroom opening orders from booksellers, so that I had the feel of the marketplace literally at my fingertips. 
That time was magical and we never expected it to end, even after Bennett and Donald took the company public, acquired Knopf, and, in 1966, sold out to RCA. By the mid-seventies the publishing industry had changed profoundly. The old downtown neighborhoods where booksellers had once rented inexpensive space and knew their customers by name had largely vanished. Readers now bought their books in mall chain stores. The bookseller in Pittsburgh or Portland whom Loomis or I might once have called to recommend a first novel had been out of business for years. Publishers now spoke to their customers through marketing specialists doing their best to fit the increasingly undifferentiated product supplied by the editors into the still less differentiated slots provided by the retail chains. Many worthy titles couldn't be fitted to these new circumstances at all and disappeared. In recent years the mall shops specializing in best-sellers have been largely replaced by so-called superstores, with much larger inventories of books. But the link between writer and marketplace which had once been the editor's function has all but vanished. 
The Random House phone book is now the size of a small city directory. Loomis and I are still listed, but after forty years nearly everything else about book publishing has changed. What had been a craft is now an irrational accretion of improvisational adjustments to historic accidents, a largely fossilized organism that can no longer be deconstructed. Its future depends on how well its remaining energies can be directed toward new technological possibilities. 
I am delighted to say that these possibilities already exist. The widespread distribution of printed books via the Internet is a reality a mere two and a half years after the appearance of Amazon.com. The eventual shape of Internet bookselling is not yet fully evident, but it is evident enough to foreshadow a much more direct--and economical--link between writer and reader than has existed in modern times. The choice of a career in book publishing may seem bleak at the moment, but if I were starting out today I might give it a try. To publish a book that may make the world a little more intelligible or decent can be almost as satisfying as writing one. And soon it might just be possible to carry on this work with even greater confidence than Loomis and I shared forty years ago.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I concur in the judgment of our distinguished chairman on the important question of the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance and I thank him for insisting that it be made clear for the record, as indeed has been done thanks to the distinguished Presiding Officer. 
Mr. President, S. 1415, the tobacco legislation now before the Senate, was ordered referred to the Committee on Finance on May 13, 1998. It was so referred because the Senate Parliamentarian determined that the bill is in the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. That action preserved the jurisdiction over tax legislation for which the Finance Committee has been responsible for 181 years. 
The Record should be clear that this is indeed a tax bill. The Parliamentarian has so determined; the Joint Committee on Taxation has concurred. 
One may refer to certain provisions of this legislation as `annual payments,' `lookback assessments,' or `fees,' but they are taxes. As Richard Cardinal Cushing said, `When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.' Call it whatever you like, but this bill raises taxes on tobacco, and we're not fooling anybody to suggest otherwise. 
And as I have said, taxes have been the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance for going on two centuries now. In the case of excise taxes, which figure prominently in this bill, the Finance Committee's jurisdiction has been recognized since 1817, the year after the Committee was established. That was the 14th Congress. George W. Campbell of Tennessee, was Chairman; Senator Rufus King, of New York, was Ranking Member. 
Likewise our jurisdiction over income taxes has been recognized since the first income tax was enacted in 1861. And the Standing Rules of the Senate have explicitly provided for our jurisdiction over `revenue measures generally'--tax bills--since 1946, the year that the jurisdictions of all Senate Committees were first set forth in the Rules. I might add that our jurisdiction over international trade matters, which also arise in this bill, is equally clear and equally longstanding. 
Our revered Chairman, Senator Roth, last week insisted--with the full support of our Committee Members--that this legislation be considered by the Finance Committee before it went to the floor. It was referred to us on Wednesday, and we marked it up on Thursday. The vote to report favorably the Finance Committee amendments was 13-6. 
The Finance Committee made several important improvements to the bill. First, we converted the assorted `payments' and `assessments' to taxes. Second, we approved an increase of $1.50 per pack in the tax on tobacco, to be phased in over three years. Third, we struck from the bill a tax on exports that was a clear violation of Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. And finally, we adopted an amendment by Senator D'Amato to require that health plans provide coverage for minimum hospital stays and reconstructive surgery associated with the treatment of breast cancer. 
Some of these changes have now been included in the pending Commerce Committee substitute. Owning to the parliamentary situation, some of the other Finance Committee amendments will require separate votes. But thanks to our Chairman, the essential point has been made; the jurisdiction of the Committee on Finance has been preserved and affirmed. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to share with the Senate the sorrowful news that Rabbi Moshe Sherer, one of American Jewry's leading communal leaders, passed away yesterday afternoon at the age of 76. Rabbi Sherer was the President of Agudath Israel of America for over 30 years and has served as a reasoned, wise voice whose counsel was widely respected in the Yeshivot of his beloved Brooklyn and the halls of government in lower Manhattan, Albany, Washington, and Jerusalem. 
I first met Rabbi Sherer in the early days of the Kennedy Administration when he came to Washington on behalf of Aguduth Israel. I quickly learned to admire his sagacity and rely on his insightful counsel and abiding integrity. For over thirty-five years he was a treasured mentor and a trusted friend. 
World Jewry has lost one of its wisest statesmen. American Orthodoxy has lost a primary architect of its remarkable postwar resurgence. All New Yorkers have lost a man of rare spiritual gifts and exceptional creative vision. 
While the Senate convenes today, tens of thousands of Jews are gathering in Brooklyn, New York to bid a reverential farewell to this exceptional teacher and rare leader. New York's Governor George Pataki, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone are among the distinguished public officials participating in the funeral. 
Rabbi Sherer passed away only hours before the President of the Senate, Vice President Al Gore, addressed Agudath Israel's 76th anniversary dinner in New York. He spoke for the Senate and for all Americans when he eulogized the Rabbi as `a remarkable force for the understanding and respect and growth of Orthodox Jewry over the past fifty years', whose `contributions to spreading religious freedom and understanding have been truly indispensable in defending and expanding those same rights for all Americans in all faiths.' 
I know I speak for the entire Senate when I express my condolences to his widow Deborah, his loving children Mrs. Rachel Langer, Mrs. Elky Goldschmidt and Rabbi Shimshon Sherer, his bereaved colleagues at Agudath Israel, and all who mourn the loss of this unusual man of conscience and conviction.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Francis Albert Sinatra, a man whose voice brought wonder and joy to the lives of millions. Natural, original, the ultimate. These are just a few words to describe Mr. Sinatra's voice. A talent such as Mr. Sinatra's is rare, once in a lifetime. We are all very fortunate to have had the opportunity to experience Mr. Sinatra's voice and charisma. 
Francis Albert Sinatra was born December 12, 1915, in a tough, working-class neighborhood of Hoboken, N.J. The son of Italian immigrants, Mr. Sinatra's determination, perseverance, and belief in himself lead him to stardom. A dramatic American success story. 
Mr. Sinatra's signature songs included `Night and Day,' `Mack the Knife,' `Old Man River,' `New York, New York,' `Come Fly With Me,' `Strangers in the Night'--and, of course, `My Way.' Indeed, he did do it his way and for that we all must be grateful. 
Pete Hamill astutely described the world's love and attachment to Sinatra in New York magazine in 1980. He wrote, `Sinatra's endurance has become a rallying point for many people who feel that their sacrifices and hard work are no longer honored, their values demeaned, their musical tastes ignored and sneered at. . ..They had overcome poverty and survived two world wars; they had educated their children and given them better lives; and sometimes their children didn't even care. But it should never be forgotten that Frank Sinatra was the original working class hero. Mick Jagger's fans bought records with their allowances; Sinatra's people bought them out of wages.' 
Mr. Sinatra received the Kennedy Center honor in 1983 and was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Reagan in 1985. And on May 14, 1997, the Congress awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal in `recognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions through his entertainment career and humanitarian activities, and for other purposes.' I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of this resolution. 
Mr. Sinatra recorded more than 200 albums, from Big Band to vocal American music. He won nine Grammy Awards. In 1954, he won the Oscar for his role in `From Here to Eternity.' 
Francis Albert Sinatra is an American phenomenon. He entertained the world for more than half a century. His songs have become classics, and belong to him alone. He was a man who chose not to hide his ethnic identity, but to flaunt it in an era when such things were not done. In so doing, he opened a path that allowed other ethnic entertainers to retain their own heritage and pride. In this, the American century, Frank Sinatra in many ways embodied the American spirit, and as our century comes to a close, we must acknowledge the loss of a unique American character, of his endurance, and his talent, and for this we mourn his passing, and praise his legacy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the Senate will know, the Government of India has announced that two further underground nuclear tests occurred at 3:51, eastern daylight time, this morning. These follow the three underground explosions announced on Monday. 
Now, this might at first seem a reckless act on the part of the Government of India. But, sir, I would call attention to a statement in an Associated Press report which reads, `The Government said its testing was now complete and it was prepared to consider a ban on such nuclear testing.' 
Sir, this could be a statement of transcendent importance. It would be useful at this time, when tempers--and I use the word `temper'--are rising in the West, to recall the outrage when France carried out a series of underwater tests in the South Pacific in Mururoa Atoll on September 5, 1995, to the indignation of many other nations, but thereupon signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the following year. And, sir, it has not only signed that treaty, it has ratified it. 
The United States was among the convening nations in 1996 that signed the treaty, but this Senate has not ratified the treaty. 
The People's Republic of China followed much the same course in completing a series of tests and then agreeing to the test ban treaty. 
Just now the press is reporting all manner of administration officials are distressed that the Central Intelligence Agency did not report indications that these tests were about to take place and that somehow we were taken off guard. But I repeat a comment I made to Tim Weiner of the New York Times yesterday that it might help if the American foreign relations community would learn to read. 
The BJP Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party--now in office for essentially the first time--leads the ruling coalition and has long been militantly asserting that India was going to be a nuclear power like the other great powers of the world. It is the second most populous nation. In the election platform--technically, a manifesto in the Indian-English usage--issued before the last election, the BJP had this to say: `The BJP rejects the notion of nuclear apartheid and will actively oppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic nuclear regime. . . We will not be dictated to by anybody in matters of security requirements and in the exercise of the nuclear option.' 
This is hugely important, as is indicated by the enormous ground swell of support in India itself in the aftermath of Monday's explosion. 
In the platform put together by the coalition that now governs in India, there is a statement, not quite as assertive, but not less so. This is the National Agenda for Governance, issued 18 March 1998. It says, `To ensure the security, territorial integrity and unity of India we will take all necessary steps and exercise all available options. Toward that end we will re-evaluate the nuclear policy and exercise the option to induct nuclear weapons.' That is an Indian-English term, `induct,' as in induction into the military. It means to bring them into an active place in the Nation's military arsenal. 
Now, the President, who is in Germany, announced today that we would impose the sanctions required under law, the Glenn amendment of 1994, directed against non-declared nuclear nations that begin nuclear testing. This is the law and the Indians knew it perfectly well, even if we have, perhaps, been insufficiently attentive to bringing to their minds the implications of the law. Chancellor Kohl--Germany being a large supplier of aid to India --was with President Clinton when this was said. We should not underestimate the degree to which this might just arouse further resentment in India. 
The law is there, but also the resentment is there. In this National Agenda for Governance that I just recited, there are a number of platform `planks,' you might say principles. The second on economy reads: `We will continue with the reform process to give a strong Swadeshi thrust to ensure that the national economy grows on the principle that India shall be built by Indians.' Swadeshi is a turn of the century term of the independence movement meaning self-reliance, use indigenous materials, sweep imports out. 
They are not going to be as intimidated by sanctions as we may suppose. This is the first Hindu government in India in perhaps 800 years. We tend to forget that. When we go to visit India, distinguished persons are taken to view the Taj Mahal, the Red Fort, the India Gate. All those are monuments by conquerors --Islamic, then English. It is something we don't notice. They do. And after 50 years of Indian independence, founded by a secular government which denied all those things, there is now a Hindu government and its sensibilities need to be attended to if only as a matter of common sense. 
Do we want India in a system of nuclear arms control or don't we? I think we do. I think we ought to encourage them and explore the implications of the statement reported by the Associated Press. And while we are at it, it would do no great harm to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty ourselves. 
I see my friend from Nebraska is on the floor. I look forward 
to a comment he might make.

Well, I would say to my gallant, able friend that the Intelligence Committee could do worse than inviting some of the administration officials who are so indignant that the CIA didn't tell them what was going to happen up to say: have you read any Indian newspaper recently? Do you happen to know what the largest democracy in the world is and who they elected in the last election? Have you looked into their party platforms.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I much agree. May I say to my friend that I was Ambassador to India on May 18, 1974, when the Indians exploded a `peaceful' nuclear explosion, as they said, in India on the same testing grounds used this time. It fell on me to call on then Prime Minister Gandhi to express our concerns. I have to say that Secretary Kissinger was mild; he toned down the indignation that came from the Department of State in his draft statement. I did say to Mr. Gandhi on that occasion, speaking for myself, without instructions, that India had made a great mistake, that it was the No. 1 country in south Asia, the hegemonic country in South Asia, Pakistan No. 3, if you like, then you go down to the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka; but in 25 years time there would be a Mongol general in Islamabad with a nuclear capacity, saying, I have got four bombs and I want the Punjab back and I want this region or that region, the Kashmir, or else I will drop them on what was then Bombay, New Delhi, Madras and Calcutta. 
Well, something like that is happening and we better see that it doesn't go forward. So to explore the Indian offer here, suggesting the offer, seems to me, a matter of huge importance. We could see the end of the cold war, followed by a nuclear proliferation of a kind we never conceived. We can see China, North Korea, and Pakistan arming in nuclear modes against India and Russia and us looking at an Armageddonic future that we had felt was behind us.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill which, of course, creates the IRS Oversight Board and follows exactly the proposal made by the report of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service: `A Vision for the New IRS.' This exceptional document is the work of an extraordinarily able public and private group, including the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska, who is managing this legislation today. Their report called for the inclusion of the Secretary or Deputy Secretary on the board. 
The Secretary of the Treasury is not a bureaucrat, sir. He is the second-ranking member of the American Government; third if you want to include the Vice President. At any given moment there is the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury. Their predecessors begin with Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, and the sequence since has been extraordinary. 
Now, I speak from personal experience. I have known every Secretary of the Treasury since the Honorable C. Douglas Dillon of New Jersey, who served President Kennedy so well and then stayed on with President Johnson--Secretary Dillon; Henry Fowler; Joseph Barr; David Kennedy; John Connally; George Shultz; William Simon; Michael Blumenthal; William Miller; Donald Regan; James A. Baker, III; Nicholas Brady; Lloyd Bentsen--our own Lloyd Bentsen--and now Robert E. Rubin. 
They have been among the principal officers of the American Government. And a board that includes such is an important institution. Absent that, sir, it is inevitably one of the myriad advisory commissions which do useful work but are never and cannot be central to the concerns of the American Government. 
The House of Representatives voted 426-4 for a bill that included the Secretary for the obvious reason that absent his membership or her membership on the board, nothing comes back to the Secretary with the force of his or her own endorsement. The board does not know what only the Secretary can know. If you prefer the model of a corporate board and the chief executive officer, do so. I prefer the model of American Government with a Cabinet officer chosen in a two-century succession, chosen by an elected President, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, responsible for this high and solemn responsibility. 
If the Secretary is on the board, the board will know things it cannot otherwise learn. And the Treasury Department in turn will have the advice and counsel of persons, we hope, not next year but 50 years from now and will continue to think of this as a public service of importance and consequence. 
The Secretary of the Treasury is a world figure. This very moment our Secretary is on his way to London to again engage in the increasingly institutionalized international economic deliberations which are so important to the world. If he is on this board, it becomes an important one; if he is not, it becomes a marginal advisory committee. 
The idea that there are concerns that a board might have, that private members might have, which the Secretary would not have, does not speak well to our understanding of the centuries of occupants of this high office. 
Nor, sir, does it address a slight matter, but little noted in this debate, which is the information we received from the Treasury Department that in a given year there are some $195 billion in taxes owed but not paid. Anyone who wishes to describe ours as a tyrannical, unfeeling, and ruthless tax collection administration might ponder how it comes about that $195 billion a year--$2 trillion a decade--of legitimately owed taxes go unpaid. 
That will be a part of the responsibility of this panel as well, and properly so, so let us do what the wise judgment of the Commission proposed that we do. We are here in response to that effort. Let us do what clearly is in the interests of this institution and include the Secretary, as the Finance Committee did in the measure now before the Senate. 
I see my friend from Florida. Is there any Member wishing to speak in favor of the amendment?

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, January 1, 2000 is just over 600 days away. The century date change, or Y2K for short, is a matter of large and serious consequence. In testimony before the Senate Commerce, Committee, Federal Reserve Board Governor Edward Kelley Jr. estimated that U.S. businesses will spend at least $50 billion on Y2K conversion, with the worldwide repair cost potentially exceeding $300 billion. 
The century date change is also an issue of surpassing difficulty for the Internal Revenue Service. IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti recently stated in a USA Today interview: 
The most compelling thing by far is fixing the computers so they don't stop working on Jan. 1, 2000. . . . If we don't fix (them), there will be 90 million people 21 months from now who won't get refunds. The whole financial system of the United States will come to a halt. It's very serious. It no only could happen, it will happen if we don't fix it right. 
In testimony before the Finance Committee last year, Linda Willis of the General Accounting Office suggested that `the IRS [may be] the largest civilian year 2000 conversion, at least in the country, and possibly in the world.' She also testified that the Y2K problem could be `catastrophic' if not addressed. 
The century date change is the highest technology priority at the IRS; more than 550 employees are at work on Y2K conversion-related activities. The IRS will spend approximately $1 billion to become Y2K compliant. 
Unfortunately, the IRS has begun to experience complications in its Y2K conversion efforts. On January 23, the Associated Press reported that `about 1,000 taxpayers who were current in their tax installment agreements were suddenly declared in default,' caused by `an attempt to fix a Year 2000 issue in one of the IRS computers.' 
In addition, last year's Taxpayer Relief Act included hundreds of changes in the tax laws, requiring diversions of scarce IRS computer programming resources and causing a 3 month delay in the Agency's Y2K efforts. 
The Y2K problem is more complex than it may seem. The IRS computers are outdated; the reprogramming must be done in obsolete computer languages that are no longer taught in schools. 
Mr. President, it was with these challenges in mind that Senator Kerrey and I offered this amendment to briefly delay some of the effective dates in the Finance Committee's IRS Restructuring legislation in order to allow time for the Y2K conversion to be completed. This amendment has been drafted based on Commissioner Rossotti's recommendations, and has been modified after consultations with the Majority. 
The amendment would delay the effective date on a list of provisions from date of enactment until after the century date change. 
Regrettably, we were unable to reach agreement with the majority on additional effective date delays that Commissioner Rossotti has recommended. I fear we will come to regret this. 
Mr. President I hope that in conference we will examine these effective dates again, and that we will agree to change those that risk interfering with Commissioner Rossotti's Y2K conversion program. I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Bob Kerrey, Bond, Kennedy, Durbin and DeWine in introducing the `Children's Hospital Education and Research Act of 1998.' This legislation recognizes the value of supporting medical training. it establishes an interim source of funding for financing residency training expenses for free-standing children's hospitals until a permanent source of funding for all medical education is developed. 
Medical education is one of America's most precious public resources. It is a public good--a good from which everyone benefits, but for which no one is willing to pay. As a public good, explicit and dedicated funding for residency training programs must be secured so that the United States will continue to lead the world in the quality of its health care system. This legislation provides for such dedicated funding for residency training programs in children's hospitals. 
I have introduced legislation--S. 21--which creates a medical education trust fund to support all accredited medical schools and teaching hospitals. Additionally, I requested that specific language be inserted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 charging the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to: 
. . . make recommendations regarding the financing of graduate medical education (GME), including consideration of alternative broad-based sources of funding for such education and funding for institutions not currently eligible for such GME support that conduct approved graduate medical residency programs, such as children's hospitals. 
Children's hospitals have a vitally important mission providing patient care, medical training and research in the face of an increasingly competitive health system. I am pleased to support Senator Kerrey's bill and look forward to working with him and other members of the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare as we seek stable and sufficient funding for medical education.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in yesterday's Wall Street Journal Edward Yardeni, chief economist and managing director of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, wrote that there is 60 percent chance that the year 2000 (Y2K) computer bug will cause a recession and that the U.S. may experience a $1 trillion drop in nominal GDP and a $1 trillion loss in stock market capitalization. A trillion dollar drop. I do not know if these predictions will come true, but I do know the millennial malady is real. 
In his op-ed, Mr. Yardeni encourages States to follow the advice of Bank of England governor Eddie George, who says the British government should freeze all regulatory and legislative changes that would burden the computers of financial institutions already struggling to fix their Y2K problem. In a similar gesture, Commissioner Rossotti has asked that provisions in the IRS restructuring bill be delayed until after the year 2000. This delay would allow the IRS to solve the year 2000 problem before changes to the tax code are implemented. The Commissioner has sent us a six-page letter detailing how he would phase in such changes. Commissioner Rossotti knows what he is talking about, and I hope we will listen to him. 
This past Sunday, May 3, 1998, the front page of the Washington Post called attention to another important aspect of Y2K--the legal blame game. At issue: who should pay the cost of the millennium bug. If a date-related computer failure prevents an airline from flying, for example, who will make up the millions of dollars in lost ticket revenue? Should the airline just swallow the cost itself, or are its computer and software suppliers liable? How about individual programmers? Or the insurance companies that cover those parties? 
The article states that there are pending lawsuits on Y2K and that the suits are the first in what legal specialists predict could be a wave of litigation that eventually could prove more expensive and time-consuming than the worldwide effort to fix the problem in the first place. According to the article, preliminary estimates for litigation and settlement costs range from $100 billion to $1 trillion. As a member of the recently established Special Committee on the year 2000 technology problem, I hope that we will have the opportunity to take a closer look into the legal issues surrounding the Y2K problem. 
These articles illustrate the serious and far-reaching effects of the millennium bug. I have referred to Y2K as the `13th labor of Hercules.' People have begun to realize the magnitude of this problem. We must all work together to ensure the proper functioning not only of our Government, but of the economy.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my congratulations, on the occasion of the Centennial of the oldest social work training program in the nation, to the Columbia University School of Social Work. Evolving from a summer program organized by the Charity Organization in New York, the School of Social Work has a long history of pioneering research, informed advocacy, and exceptional professional training. 
It is a remarkable accomplishment that social workers have played key roles in every major social reform movement, from settlement houses to labor reform, to the New Deal, to civil rights and voter registration. Many of the things we take for granted today--Social Security, child-labor laws, the minimum wage, the 40-hour work week, Medicare--came about because social workers saw injustice, acted, and inspired others. 
Throughout the century, Columbia's faculty, students, and alumni have worked tirelessly to address both the causes and symptoms of our most pressing social problems. National movements, such as the White House Conference on Children and the National Urban League, have emerged from projects undertaken by the School's faculty and administrators in cooperation with professional and community organizations. The entire nation has benefited from the research and work of people such as Eveline Burns (Social Security); Mitchell I. Ginsberg (Head Start); Richard Cloward (welfare rights and voter registration); Alfred Kahn and Sheila B. Kamerman (cross-national studies of social services); and David Fanshel (children in foster care). 
As the School, and indeed the social profession, move into their second centuries, they will be challenged to respond to social change, new social problems, family change, and evolving societal commitments. Now more than ever, we will need well-trained and dedicated social workers to work with troubled children and families, organize communities for change, conduct cutting-edge research, administer social programs, and alleviate society's most intractable problems. 
It is with appreciation and admiration that I extend my best wishes to the Columbia University School of Social Work on its Centennial and look forward to its future activity and achievement.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to congratulate the Senator from North Dakota on a clear and persuasive presentation of what is not just a North Dakota problem, but a national problem. The United States is blessed beyond the imaginings of William Jennings Bryan by the degree to which a very small farm population provides the most ample diet the world has ever known for a global nation. 
I might say--and it won't come as a surprise to my friend from North Dakota, but not everybody would know--that New York State is a wheat-growing region. In 62 counties, I think we have commercial wheat grown in 50. There are parts of the western areas of the State where if you travel along the Erie Canal, at the level where it is raised above the surrounding land looking north and south, you could be in North Dakota looking at the wheat fields. Those prices affect ours, too. The Senator is right to think that the '96 legislation should be revisited in terms of the economic realities facing those farmers, upon whom we all depend, because we eat that bread and drink that beer. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will add a historical note here because it suggests the global reach of what might seem to be local problems. I think it is widely agreed that it was the arrival of wheat from western New York in Liverpool through the Erie Canal that led to the repeal of what the British called the `corn laws'--the British use the term `corn'; we use the term `wheat'--which kept the tariffs on wheat so that the vast landlords could remain the vast landlords. American wheat was so much less expensive that the British decided to cease all that and become an industrial nation. And then two generations later, it was the arrival in the Baltic of wheat from North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas. The prices were such that the local, aristocratical, landed gentry of Prussia simply could not compete. The next thing you know, you have enormous emigration from that part of the world to the United States through Ellis Island. These are not small events. 
The price of food is a very important matter. It is a tribute to American farmers that we don't think much about it any longer because it has become relatively stable. I can speak to the fact 
that when we began the War on Poverty, under President Johnson, we used as a measure the `city workers food basket', which was designed by the Department of Agriculture and measured what is necessary to raise a family of 4 in the city. We said a family needed 3 times that number. Well, this quickly became hopelessly out of date because the price of food kept going down. Now the price will go up. If those prices crash now, prices will rise later. The Senator is on to something important, and I thank him, as one Member of this body.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise, in the first instance, to commend our chairman for his commitment to restoring public confidence in the Internal Revenue Service and for the legislation he has so ably crafted and now so succinctly set forth in the opening statement of this debate, which I think will probably consume the better part of the Senate's time for this week. 
He, of course, stood on the shoulders of giants, you might say. In the report of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, `A Vision for a New IRS,' which was a statutory commission established in 1996, and which reported in June of 1997--chaired by our distinguished and gallant committee member Bob Kerrey, J. Robert Kerrey, whom I will ask to manage this legislation in the days ahead, he having been the principal author here, along with his colleague from the other side of the aisle, Senator Chuck Grassley, Charles Grassley, `Chuck' to his friends. They anticipated the work we did, although I don't think they could have anticipated some of the things we encountered in those hearings. Those two Senators have been indefatigable in their endeavor to transform the IRS into a consumer-based agency. 
As two rounds of hearings held by the Finance Committee illustrate, there is much room for improvement at the IRS. There is much room for improvement in almost any of our Government agencies, but few, other than the Social Security Administration, so directly affect the citizenry, and none other has the capacity to be punitive, to extract resources, to impose fines. There is no other agency such as this. It is extraordinary, the fact that we have paid so little attention to the management of the Service. 
The Internal Revenue Service was created in 1862 in the administration of President Lincoln, at the time when an income tax was established to help finance the Civil War. President Lincoln signed the Civil War Income Tax Act into law July 1, 1862. However, it was not until last September, nearly a century and a half later, that the full Finance Committee exercised its oversight jurisdiction, and no credit can be too great to be given Senator Roth as the new chairman for this effort. 
It is our duty to know what is going on in this large public agency. It has more than 100,000 employees. In 1997, it collected $1.5 trillion and processed 210 million tax returns. We get used to these numbers, Mr. President, but to give a sense of dimension, 1 billion minutes ago, Julius Caesar ruled the Roman Empire. If that is what 1 billion minutes is, think what 1.5 trillion minutes would be. 
Some, mind you, contend that the IRS is out of control and somehow should be abolished. In truth, we simply need to get it under control and shaped in the mode of modern management. 
Last November, the Senate took an important first step to getting the agency in such a working mode by unanimously confirming Charles O. Rossotti as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. We have previously, for generations, had tax lawyers as the Commissioners. They were superb tax lawyers, gifted and committed, but not necessarily managers for the management problem that needed to be addressed. And particularly not technologies. The Service had a huge problem bringing itself along into the computer age. Vast amounts have been spent with systems that do not interact well. And now, of course, we have the year 2000 problem, which all agencies of Government face. All activities you can imagine compounding that earlier difficulty. 
Commissioner Rossotti has already made a visible difference. He has put in motion a plan to modernize the agency by reorganizing according to type of taxpayer, such as the individual payer, the small business, the large corporation, or the exempt organization, of which there are so many, rather than according to the simple organization of regional offices that do everything. 
In addition to establishing programs to improve the treatment of taxpayers, such as problem-solving days and extended telephone service, Commissioner Rossotti has done two things very specifically addressed to the concerns of the Finance Committee. He has appointed former Comptroller General Charles Bowsher to conduct an independent review of the IRS internal Inspection Service. It was remarkable that the Comptroller General, after 15 years of dealing with the Congress' often unfortunate demands on the General Accounting Office, came back to public service to do this. A more qualified person you could not imagine. 
Secondly, and again an achievement of some considerable measure, Mr. Rossotti has persuaded Judge William Webster, formerly the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and prior to that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to look into the activities and the operations of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Internal Revenue Service. 
This is, obviously, a troubled branch of the agency. We do not associate the Internal Revenue Service with men in body armor carrying automatic weapons, breaking into offices and telling everyone to freeze, if you will. Yet, we heard testimony that could not be doubted that just such things are happening, and they need to be very carefully controlled and obviously have not been. How widespread that behavior is, we do not know. But we will learn from Judge Webster, and not a moment too soon. 
The legislation before us represents a second major step. It would establish an Internal Revenue Service oversight board consisting of six private citizens, a representative of the IRS employees' union, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Commissioner of the IRS itself. The board will be responsible for certifying the strategic direction and goals of the agency, while the Commissioner will continue to manage all day-to-day operations. The Finance Committee specifically voted to include the Secretary and a union representative on the board, making the composition of that board identical to that of the House bill reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means, which passed the House of Representatives by an extraordinary vote of 426-4. 
But now it should be clear in anticipation of some amendments, not necessary but in anticipation of the possibility, it should be clear that if this board is to have any stature within the Government and with the public, the Secretary of the Treasury must be on it. That is basic management practice. As Senator Breaux aptly stated during the Finance Committee markup, it is also far better to have the union working cooperatively on the inside rather than working in opposition on the outside. 
I would also point out that the bill includes a number of provisions to create flexibility for the Commissioner in the area of personnel. In recognition of the great disparity between the salary structures in Government and those in the private sector on parallel activities, the legislation provides a streamlined process by which the Commissioner can appoint up to 40 individuals 
designated critical technical and professional positions for up to 4-year terms at an annual compensation equivalent to the pay of the Vice President, currently $175,400. 
The Commissioner can go out and find this person to do this particular job and make it a 4-year appointment. Persons who obviously are in the private sector will come into Government at not too large a sacrifice, and for most it would be a considerable one. I do not want to use the word `sacrifice'--lachrymose, perhaps--just a large reduction in income for the kinds of persons that will be sought after, but not so large that they cannot manage the transition. 
Other provisions will permit the establishment of a new performance management system focused on individual accountability and will allow for the creation of an award system to provide incentives for and recognition of individual group and organizational achievements. Additional measures call for the termination of IRS employees for violations committed in connection with the performance of their official duties. 
The bill contains two provisions of special interest to this Senator, the first of which Senator Kerrey and I particularly supported, and Senator Roth mentioned in his opening statement. It would require the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an analysis of complexity and administrability issues associated with all pending tax legislation. 
Many of the problems faced by the IRS arise from the Tax Code itself. One of the clearest visions of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service was simplification of the tax law which says it is necessary to reduce taxpayer burden and facilitate improved tax administration. One has to note, regrettably perhaps, that our proposal for simplification goes on some 511 pages. 
This is a pattern we have gotten into which we ought to avoid. 
If enacted, and this bill will be enacted, it will be the 64th public law to amend the Internal Revenue Code since the great Tax Reform Act of 1986. In 1986, led by Senator Packwood, we greatly simplified the Code. We lowered tax rates, we broadened the base, we got rid of all manner of absurdities and irrational provisions in the Code. 
The core group, as we called ourselves, would meet each morning in Senator Packwood's office and talk about the day's plans. It would be my particular job to provide a reading from the Wall Street Journal. I would find--never failed--an advertisement somewhere in the Journal of that day talking about mountain sheep or billy goats, or what have you, in which it would say `losses guaranteed.' Such were the provisions of the Tax Code at that time--you made money by investing in activities that lost money. We cleared all that out, or thought we did, and we brought rates down and hoped they would stay there. 
This will be the 64th law since that time amending and complexifying. I recall last year we passed a bill, 802 pages, called the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and the only copy on the Senate floor was here at this desk. The copy for the chairman was spirited away to be examined in the Budget Committee for violations of the Byrd rule, as I recall. And Senators would come up and ask the Senator from New York if there were certain provisions in the bill. They had no way of knowing because there was no copy on the floor. 
This sort of analysis will take time to do it, but 20 years from now we may look back and think that one of the most important provisions that was contained in this measure was the report by the Joint Committee on Taxation of the complexity of a tax measure, and how well, in fact, the IRS could handle its administration. Because if we failed to simplify the Code, we failed to address the heart of this problem. Complexity contributes to taxpayer frustration, obviously, and to tax evasion, as well. 
We look forward to working with the chairman to try to reduce tax evasion, which is a much larger matter than we have tended to assume. 
Commissioner Rossotti, in his testimony before the Finance Committee on Friday, stated that tax evasion is now at an estimated $195 billion a year. If we were to do no more than collect half the taxes now owed and deliberately not paid, our revenue situation would be profoundly changed. And that can be done, and I think Commissioner Rossotti intends to at least attempt it. We are talking about laws here. If we are a nation of laws, not only do taxpayers have rights, but they have responsibilities. Both should be pursued with energy and effectiveness. 
A second provision has to do with the so-called year 2000 problem or the century date change, as Commissioner Rossotti terms it. The IRS has had some well-publicized difficulties with its computer modernization efforts. These problems have been exacerbated by programming changes required by the Taxpayer Relief Act last year and by the year 2000 problem. 
It is beginning to sink in that we have a real problem here. Our majority leader and the minority leader are much to be congratulated. We have now created a special committee on this matter with our distinguished colleague, Senator Bennett, as the chairman. This is not a problem in the ordinary sense, a difficulty to be looked after or endured. No. The General Accounting Office testified before us September of last year that the computer conversion problem could be catastrophic. The whole system could crash. We are not alone in this regard. The IRS is just another large information center dependent on information processing which it cannot do if the computers are not changed in time. The adjustments are not that complicated but the pressure of time is extraordinary. 
I recently had the occasion of introducing the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, our distinguished Chairman Arthur Levitt, who was nominated for a second term. We were talking while we were waiting for the hearing in the Banking Committee to begin. He mentioned this issue and said that for the banks and such he is responsible for, if they do not get this done it is terminal. Not just that the profits drop a bit or some activities can't survive--it is terminal. 
The Defense Department has unimaginable difficulties. They will get it done or they hope they will get it done, or our missiles won't be aimed in the right direction, things like that. And the Commissioner has asked that some of the provisions in this bill be delayed not for a long time but until after the year 2000 so he can have the year 2000 problem solved before he puts in these new provisions. It is a very reasonable, orderly, sane recommendation and we would be disorderly not to heed it. He has already sent us a six-page letter that tells us when he can have this provision in place, when he can have that provision in place. He knows what he is talking about. I hope we will listen. 
Two final points: The bill requires the Joint Committee and the Treasury to study the issue of taxpayer confidentiality. We must strike a balance between taxpayer privacy on the one hand and the ability of Government to function on the other. In our hearings we have had a matter where IRS officials, faced with specific charges, will often seem evasive or unresponsive in their answers. What they are doing is responding to the law that forbids them to discuss things they know, but which are confidential. Some balancing of that is in order, and I hope we can see it brought about. 
Finally, Mr. President, a comment on the cost of the legislation. Through the ingenuity of the chairman, we have fully funded this measure for the first 5 years of its operation. It is underfunded by $10 billion in the second 5 years. We hope to do something about this. I think it is unseemly of us to bring tax reform legislation to the Senate and fully ignore the fact that we aren't paying for it. We can pay for it; it is not an impossible sum, and it is surely incumbent upon the committee and the managers of the legislation to see if we can't find that extra $10 billion.

As I said, it would be unseemly to bring a measure of this kind to the floor saying, `Let's manage these matters better,' and not manage to pay for it. That is welcome news, and the Senator has my cooperation on that, to be sure. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am going to ask Senator Kerrey to manage the legislation on our side. As I said, he was co-chairman of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. Their superb report, `A New Vision for the IRS,' which was issued last June--11 months ago--has led to the work we are doing now, which we bring to the floor with pride and with the expectation that we will be successful. 
On that note, sir, I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. In the brief period that I will be speaking, I would like to concentrate on the central issue: the dangers of nuclear war in the years ahead. 
Earlier, in an address to the 150th anniversary gathering of the Associated Press, I cited a comment made last autumn by Richard Holbrooke, the American diplomat, now temporarily in private life. 
Richard Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton agreement regarding the former Yugoslavia, commented that `almost a decade has gone by since the Berlin Wall fell and, instead of reaching out to Central Europe, the European Union turned toward a bizarre search for a common currency. So NATO enlargement had to fill the void.' As if this were an accidental policy that derives from the unwillingness of our European friends--some of them our NATO allies--to engage in the more serious work of bringing the once more independent republics of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland into the European Union, a common market from which their economic development can grow, that being clearly the single most pressing concern they have in the aftermath of the half century of a Stalinist economy imposed upon them with the same results for them--not quite so bad, but bad enough--that Russia itself experienced. 
The disaster of this era for the Russians cannot be exaggerated. I say to my dear friend from Delaware, who has been so generous in letting us speak on these matters, Murray Feshbach has recently established that the life expectancy of Russian men dropped from 62 years in 1989 to 57 years in 1996. There is no historical equivalent. A century ago, a 16-year-old Russian male had a 54 percent chance of surviving to age 60. Two percent less than had he been born a century ago. Such has been the implosion of Soviet society--in every respect, including the nuclear one. 
Now, earlier on in a statement, I remarked, and I will take the liberty of remarking once again, that the origins of NATO seem very distant to most Members of the Senate. That age seems like another era. And in a sense it was another era. But there are a few witnesses from that era who are still active and who still speak. 
George Kennan, who conceived the whole idea of containment, of which NATO was an expression and perhaps the most important one, George Kennan has said NATO expansion, in the aftermath of the defeat of the Soviet Union, he says, would be `the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold war era.' `The most fateful error.' 
Paul Nitze, who was the principal author of NSC-68, the national security directive written in 1950, which established the American policy of containment, recently wrote to me to say, `In the present security environment, NATO expansion is not only unnecessary, it is gratuitous. If we want a Europe whole and free, we are not likely to get it by making NATO fat and feeble.' 
In my remarks to the Associated Press, I simply said that expanding NATO at this time, and particularly should we move up to include the Baltic States, which we are pledged to support, would put us at risk of getting into a nuclear war with Russia: wholly unanticipated, for which we are not prepared, about which we are not thinking. 
Professor Michael Mandelbaum, at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said `that is not hyperbole.' That is what we are dealing with here. And the reason, NATO expansion is viewed throughout elements of the Russian political system as a hostile act. Some think of it as a hostile act they could live with; some think it is a hostile act they will have to defend against; and they have said if they have to defend their territory, they will do so with nuclear weapons; it is all they have left. 
Their Army has all been disintegrated--not entirely, but they remark in a December 17 National Security memorandum signed by Mr. Yeltsin, that stretches of their borders are undefended. Their Navy is rusting in a seaport, nominally part of the Ukraine. 
They have nuclear weapons. After all we have gone through to achieve rational nuclear postures: a no-first-use policy, graduated 
response to threats, only resorting to strategic nuclear weapons at the very last moment when no other options are available--that is gone. We are back to the hair trigger that we knew when I was a young person in this Government, in this city, when we could imagine having use air-raid shelters. We could imagine it, because we could remember the Second World War. 
I was called back into the Navy in 1951, briefly, as it turned out, but found myself in Bremerhaven, in the submarine pens there that the Nazis had built. The British finally got a bomb through one, but never did during the war. We were sent on an expedition to Berlin. We had the practice of sending American officers on trains through Soviet-occupied Germany to establish the fact that we had the right to do so. 
I arrived in Berlin, and it wasn't there. Just ruined rubble; early in the morning, a few men stumbling out of a few bars, lost to the world. 
We knew what war meant, and we can imagine what nuclear war means. We just had dropped two bombs on Japan. From the time of President Eisenhower, we have been negotiating ways to control atomic weapons--and we had success. Those early arms control agreements, apart from the agreement President Kennedy reached on atmospheric nuclear testing, those early agreements typically just ratified the increases in nuclear weapons that each side wanted, but we got the START agreement and we reduced our nuclear arsenals. 
The START Treaty, negotiated with the Soviet Union, was signed by four entirely different countries, because by the time it was finished the Soviet Union had disappeared. Russia has not yet ratified START II. The idea of START III, to reduced deployed nuclear weapons ever further, hasn't even begun. They haven't ratified START II, not least because of NATO expansion. I don't claim to know what the actual decisions in the Duma are, but that is what one hears, and one can imagine it. 
Tomorrow there will be a report by the Physicians for Social Responsibility, an American group, principally, that has won a Nobel Prize on the issue of preventing nuclear warfare. They will publish a report in the New England Journal of Medicine which says that the danger of nuclear attack continues and may even be thought to escalate. The New York Times reports this in the terms we have been speaking about on this floor, the exact same terms, with no idea that was coming. 
It says, `Russia's Disarray Brings a Nuclear Risk to the U.S., Study Says.' The Physicians write, `Although many people believe that the threat of a nuclear attack largely disappeared with the end of the cold war there is considerable evidence to the contrary. Each side routinely maintains thousands of nuclear warheads on high alert. Furthermore, to compensate for its weakened conventional forces, Russia has abandoned its no-first use policy.' 
Madam President, that is all I and my friend from Virginia has said on this floor this week of debate and when the expansion of NATO was debated a month ago. Suddenly we have it in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, saying to those who think this threat is behind us. Indeed, it is ahead of us, and we must be very careful, so careful, about what we do. That is why so many of us, starting with the great men--Kennan and Nitze--who conceived the strategy for the cold war, which we won, are saying, `Don't do this.'

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I conclude by saying, I just happened 20 minutes ago to be speaking to our revered former majority leader, Howard Baker, who was in the Capitol to testify before the Finance Committee. I said I was coming over to offer this amendment. He and Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft, and Alton Frye have said, `Don't do this.' He said with respect to Russian nuclear weapons; they have them, but they don't know how many they have and they don't know who controls them. The whole situation of command and control is very limited and weak and uncertain. 
Not many years ago, after the end of the cold war, Norway put up a rocket for purposes of research which put the Russian on nuclear alert. They had 15 minutes to decide whether to go to launch on warning. It was that close. We were that close to nuclear war. We will be closer in the aftermath of NATO expansion.

Just the fact of NATO's guarantee of the borders of these three countries gives them an advantage over the rest of Eastern Europe. That is formidable, among other things. 
Could I just take a moment to agree that the idea that Turkey can't get into the EU is appalling. When we were fighting in Korea in the first real war of the cold war, the Turks were there.

It would cost them a great deal more if instability returns to Europe.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I express my gratitude to the Senator from Delaware for his thoughtful comments. Might I simply respond that the behavior of the Western Europeans and the European Union has been self-interested. But perhaps, after half a century of our defending them, having in the first instance liberated them, we might hope for a more open view. 
For half a century, half the defense expenditure of the United States has gone to NATO. I believe that is correct--half. We have had American troops on the Rhine since 1944. That, Madam President, is the stuff of Roman Legions. But out of that commitment which we have made--an unparalleled act of generosity and self-interest, but informed self-interest and extraordinary generosity--has grown a vibrant and wealthy European community. On Saturday, many of its members will form a common currency. It is not too much to ask them to do themselves and Europe the favor of extending membership to these newly independent nations. I can imagine that they will if we make the effort. We are the ones who first came along with the proposal to expand NATO and therefore expand American force. Isn't a half-century enough? I would have thought it was. I would not give up hope that we might see some enlightened self-interest in Brussels. There is really reason to hope for that. 
When the Senator from Delaware mentioned the economic divisions of the Washington treaty as reported by the Foreign Relations Committee, they were talking about the Schuman Plan, an unheard of plan to have France and Germany unite in a common market--common production of iron and steel and the coal that goes with it. The disputes over Alsace-Lorraine, which they fought over for all those years, might come to an end. It did. And it could happen again. 
I thank the Chair. I very much appreciate the courtesy that has been shown to Senator Warner and myself. I see Senator Torricelli is on the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in brief, a moment of history about Russia. 
On March 20, 1917, one of the most momentous Cabinet meetings in American history took place in which Woodrow Wilson and his Cabinet judged that German submarine warfare had reached a point which left the United States with no choice but to enter the war on behalf of the Allied Powers. In 13 days Wilson would convened Congress and speak to a joint session asking for recognition of the state of war with Germany. At the Cabinet meeting, Robert Lansing, as Secretary of State, spoke in favor of doing this. He captured the meeting in a memorandum in which he wrote: `I said that the revolution in Russia which appeared to be successful had removed the one objection to affirming that the European war was a war between democracy and absolutism.' 
Sir, in 1917, Russia had a democratic revolution. As a schoolchild in New York, I can recall the head of that provisional government, Mr. Kerensky, would come around to our assemblies to tell us about it. That democratic revolution was crushed by Lenin and the Bolsheviks in St. Petersburg. And the country lived a hideous 70 years under that regime. Then the Russians liberated themselves. They did it internally. 
They had to face a second coup against Mr. Gorbachev with tanks around the government buildings. The tanks withdrew and the forces of an earlier protodemocratic government prevailed. There are Russians who genuinely believe that they liberated their country. They now once more have the possibilities they had at the beginning of the century before the Bolsheviks took power. Why some of us here hated the Bolsheviks, hated Lenin and Stalin, and their successes, was not just for what they stood for but for what they had crushed. 
There is a belief that is growing in Russia--one learns this; one hears this--that they not only freed themselves of the infamous Stalin and Lenin but also the countries around them; and that they should be seen now as a partner, not as the enemy. They were under the rule of the their enemies. 
I hope we will see this and not expand in their direction an alliance that was formed against Joseph Stalin and his politburo. Give us a chance to bring Russia into the democratic world in which it almost entered and which will now be put in jeopardy, or so some of us believe. What a historic failure that would be. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in the foreseeable future the central strategic object of the United States and the world will be that of controlling the spread of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in the Near East, in South Asia, in East Asia, and the control of them in Russia itself. 
If we can have the cooperation, however tacit, of the Russian Government in these affairs, we have great hopes and possibilities. If we were to have their hostility, their opposition, it could be ruinous to the world. We are talking about nuclear war and biological and chemical war. That, in my view, is what is at issue in this decision we are about to make and the amendment I have offered. 
I thank the Chair for its courteous attention.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my colleague Senator D'Amato, and with Senators Mikulski and Snowe, legislation important to ensuring that women with breast cancer and cervical cancer will receive coverage for their treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a successful nationwide program--National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection program--that screens low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. However, CDC's program does not have funding to treat these women after they are diagnosed. 
The women eligible for cancer screening under the CDC program are low-income individuals and yet are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid coverage. They do not have health insurance coverage for these screenings and for subsequent cancer treatment. 
From July of 1991 to March of 1997, the CDC program provided mammography screening to almost 600,000 women and diagnosed nearly 3,500 cases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program also provided over 700,000 pap smears and found more than 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer. 
The CDC screening program has had to divert a significant amount of time and funding in order to find treatment opportunities for the women found to have breast and cervical cancer. The lack of subsequent funding for treatment has, therefore, jeopardized the programs' primary function: to screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. Currently, the program screens about 12 to 15 percent of all eligible women. 
A recent study conducted at Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and Evaluation and the University of Michigan School of Public Health on treatment funding for women screened by the CDC program found that, although funding for treatment services were found for most of these women, they often experienced time delays. In addition, during the search for treatment funding, the CDC program lost contact with several women. The study also found that the sources of treatment funding are uncertain, tenuous and fragmented. The burden of funding treatment often fell upon providers themselves. The uncertainty and delays worsen the stress of coping with cancer. Some women, upon learning that they have cancer, must hold lunches and bake sales to raise funds to cover their needed treatment. 
Our legislation would provide treatment coverage for the women screened and diagnosed through the CDC program and who are uninsured. States will have the option to provide this coverage through its Medicaid program. If a state chooses this option, they will receive an enhanced match for the treatment coverage, similar to the federal match provided to the sate for the CDC screening program. 
Mr. President, the Senate has approved this proposal in the past. A similar provision was included in the Senate version of last year's Balanced Budget bill. It is my hope that the Senate will again support this important legislation.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sir, would you be aware--and obviously 
this is a rhetorical question because the Senator is very much aware--that the resolution of ratification has a section, `The Strategic Concept of NATO,' in which I read, `The Senate declares that NATO may also, pursuant to article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty, on a case-by-case basis engage in other missions when there is consensus among its members that there is a threat to the security and interests of NATO members.' 
Would my distinguished friend not regard that as a huge expansion of the mission and territorially defined role from a specific North Atlantic Treaty Organization to a global treaty?

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I first join in thanking the revered chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for the openness with which he has addressed this issue of cost, which has come to be a bit of an embarrassment. We start out by hearing it is only $150 billion, and in no time at all we learn that it is only $3.5 million. But those are not his fooling with the estimates; that comes from downtown. 
I would like, sir, to address, just for balance, the question of who has entered objections, expressed fears, or concerns regarding NATO expansion. The majority leader was quite correct that the Secretary of State and others have joined in supporting this measure. It was their policy for many years, but it is also the case that the persons most responsible for the formation of NATO and the formation of the containment policies which NATO implemented, in a far off time that not everyone remembers--I believe it is the case, sir, that half of the Members of the Senate were born after 1940, such that many would have been aged 9 when NATO was established. It is in a distant time. 
Following World War II, American foreign policy faced the maniacal determination of Stalin to extend his effective borders and power--somewhat conceded by the United States at Yalta, in all truth. The Soviet expectation was that there would come a day, not far distant, when Socialism would manifest, with the U.S.S.R. and China leading the way to international unity. But the person who put in mind the notion that the Soviet Union will fail if you just contain them, that the internal contradictions are so awful, they can't pull this off, that man is George F. Kennan. He was a treasure then, and is doubly so now, as he is still alive to bear witness to the aftermath and the extraordinary success of his policy. 
His famous `Long Cables From Moscow' and the subsequent anonymous article publish in Foreign Affairs under the pseudonym `X' are part of the history of the United States, not just this particular period. 
Sir, George Kennan has said that expanding NATO would be `the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-world war era'--`the most fateful error.' More recently, in the World Policy Journal, he writes:  
What is at stake in this sad state of affairs is a problem of tragic and momentous importance; for the situation now prevailing stands firmly in the way of the creation in influential American opinion of any quiet thoughtful concept of American policy and hence of any really useful and constructive employment of the great and unique potential weight of this country in world affairs. But the national political establishment, as now existing, has shown itself totally incapable even of understanding the true dimensions of this problem, and much less in tackling it effectively; and one cannot now look to it for anything more than what it is capable of giving. 
I have the honor to have known Ambassador Kennan for 30 years. He has been a historian for 45 years now at the Center for Graduate Studies at Princeton. He does not normally speak with such disdain of those in, as Shakespeare called `our brief authority,' here in Washington. He is a statesman. But he says that the persons involved in a moment of `tragic and momentous importance' are quite incapable of doing anything but what they have done. 
That is George Kennan. 
If there was one other iconic--and I will use that word--person of the age still with us, still active, and in Washington, it would be, of course, Ambassador Paul Nitze. Paul Nitze, active adviser to President Truman at a time when we formed this policy we call containment and when NATO's article 5 military guarantee, that an attack upon any one of us is an attack on all of us, was extended. And don't make any mistake about that. That was the beginning. 
Paul Nitze has just this moment written in almost the same terms as George Kennan to say, don't do this. I am going to read, if I may, the letter which I received on Friday from Paul Nitze addressed, in effect, to me and to my distinguished colleague, Senator Warner. It is from the Ambassador Paul H. Nitze, the Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. It says: 
Dear Senator Moynihan: Your effort to introduce a more deliberate approach to the question of NATO expansion is most constructive. We are in a period of great change in the security challenges for which our country must be prepared, but it is also an era in which we would be foolish to squander the opportunities opened by the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Perhaps the most important such opportunity is the chance to bring Russia into the community of nations. A sensible policy to support that objective would concentrate on lending political and economic support to the development of a democratic, market-oriented society in Russia. NATO expansion distracts both us and the Russians from that goal. Indeed, the open-ended expansion being proposed for the alliance points toward increasing friction with post-Communist Russia for years to come. Driving Russia into a corner plays into the arguments of those most hostile to forging a productive relationship with the United States and its allies. It is not a sound basis for future stability in Europe, particularly when no current or projected threats warrant extending the alliance. 
As you and Senator Warner have proposed, the preferable path surely lies in the direction of enlarging the European Union to embrace the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Negotiations have now begun for the accession of the EU of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, along with others. Encouraging those negotiations is the most useful emphasis the Senate could give to current trends in Europe. It makes no sense at all to enlarge NATO merely `to fill the void,' as one senior administration official described the current process. 
Might I interject here, Mr. President, to say that was Ambassador Holbrooke, and I commented on this in my address to the Associated Press. 
To quote further: We should, on the contrary, use the period while the EU is negotiating its own enlargement to demonstrate that the Partnership for Peace--which now has more than 25 partners--is the suitable relationship for European countries which are not members of NATO. 
In the present security environment, NATO expansion is not only unnecessary; it is gratuitous. If we want a Europe whole and free, we are not likely to get it by making NATO fat and feeble. 
Mr. President, one other question. I see my friend.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on the nuclear issue, I raised this in an address to the Associated Press, their 150th anniversary, which was held in Dallas on April 20. I simply put the question: Could NATO expansion lead to nuclear war? The thrust of these remarks was that Russia is now a much weakened country--terribly weakened. They have recently issued the equivalent of our NSC-68, which Paul Nitze wrote in 1950, a national security memorandum. In the Russian National Security Blueprint, issued in December, describes how Russian armed forces have seriously declined, the army has melted away, the navy is rusted, and things like that. But it says, don't forget this. We have nuclear weapons, and don't think that we will not use them if our country is in danger. 
The whole of 40 years of national security doctrine, from President Eisenhower on, of thinking of conventional forces, of a graduated approach to conflict, of no first use of nuclear weapons--all that is off the table. Not because the Soviet Union is so powerful but because it is so weak. We can almost feel them pleading in this document to say, `Don't you understand our situation?' Back to the hair trigger of the 1950s.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Finally, just a few comments. Some attention was paid to that address. On just last Friday there was an article in USA Today in which it says: 
At a speech in Dallas this week Senator Moynihan raised eyebrows when he said that NATO expansion at a time of Russian weakness in conventional weapons and increased dependence on nuclear weapons could cause the United States and Russia `to stumble into the catastrophe of nuclear war.' 
Then this paragraph: 
`That's not hyperbole,' says Michael Mandelbaum of the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Affairs. `If NATO continues to expand, as many envision to include the Baltic States on Russia's border--Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia--we would be moving toward a hair-trigger nuclear balance of the kind we had in the 1950s and 1960s.' 
David Broder had a column last Wednesday in the Washington Post in which he quotes Jack Matlock, who is the former Ambassador to Moscow, a wonderful diplomat, who says: 
There is no question that our decision to take on new members now, when no country in Eastern Europe faces a security threat from the outside, will greatly complicate our efforts to see to it that the vast stocks of nuclear weapons now in Russia are never used against us or our allies. 
And finally, just from this morning's Newsweek magazine, there is an article by Fareed Zakaria, who is the managing editor for Foreign Affairs who simply comments--this is my last remark so Senator Wellstone can ask some questions--he asks, `Can't Russia Join the Club, Too?' But he makes one simple blunt assessment:  
NATO could defend the Baltics by only one means, nuclear attacks.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to respond first to the absolutely essential question Senator Wellstone has put, or so I judge, in the context of Mr. Gorbachev's response to Susan Eisenhower. That all takes place in the context of the reunification of Germany when the wall came down and western Germany moved into eastern Germany. There was a clear understanding that that is as far as NATO would go. That is why I believe the word `swindled' was used. 
Now I would like to make a point which I know my friend would sympathize with, and I think his father might sympathize with, which is to say this: That the Russians have the right to claim that they freed their own country from the horrors of a decayed Marxist-Leninist dictatorship. It was not always such in Russia. 
I have, Mr. President, a certain advantage which comes with age. There are not many others. But when I grew up in New York City, Alexander Kerensky would come around to speak to our high school classes from time to time.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Social Democrat. So I had the opportunity to learn early in life--which most people never seem to recall--there wasn't one Russian revolution, there were two. There was a democratic revolution, a provisional government came in, recognizable Social Democrats, as we say, and they were overthrown by the Bolsheviks. All right, now, in turn, the Bolsheviks have been overthrown. The Russians have a right to say, `we are back on course.' 
There was a rather striking meeting of Woodrow Wilson's Cabinet in Washington in the spring of 1917 after this first Russian revolution. I know my friend would be interested in this. On March 20, 1917, before the United States had entered the war, the cabinet was called together for a discussion on `the question of war with Germany and the abandonment of the policy of neutrality' as Secretary of State Robert Lansing wrote in a memorandum of the Cabinet meeting. They were very clear that war was coming with Germany and the President asked the cabinet if he showed call for a meeting of Congress to so declare. And then Lancing had this comment. He said: 
I said that the revolution in Russia, which appeared to be successful, had removed the one objection to affirming that the European war was a war between democracy and absolutism. 
We welcomed the Mensheviks, the Social Democrats, and we said--I will say that once again. Here it is 1917, the United States is about to get into the First World War--and the Second World War is just an extension of the first--and the Secretary of State believed `that the revolution in Russia, which appeared to be successful, had removed the one objection to affirming that the European war was a war between democracy and absolutism.' 
Do we want to put that in jeopardy? Don't we want the Russians to be able to say, `We are back where we were at the beginning of the century; we have a democratic tradition, not a perfect one, but we have one, we were moving there, and the Bolsheviks just stole it; we liberated Poland and we liberated the Baltic States that Stalin had seized; we have done things for which the world ought to sort of say thank you.' 
I spent most of my adult life thinking would we go to war with the Soviet Union this week or next week. It is a bit late in life that that prospect declined and has gone away, until now. Wouldn't the Senator agree that the Russian people and their leaders have something of which to be proud?

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to say here that we have an element of candor that is not always forthcoming in these matters. Ambassador Holbrooke said, what? Because Brussels won't expand the European Union, NATO expansion must fill a void. Is it filling a void because they cannot agree on a common agricultural policy in Europe? So filling a void to bring back the prospect of nuclear war, is that worth it? I know there are a lot of farmers in Poland. Well, there are a lot of farmers in Spain, too, and Ireland, too, and they got into the European Union and they have lived through it. 
The Europeans owe us something. Half--half--the defense outlays of the United States for the last half century, Mr. President, have gone to protect Europe. I was there. I was called back in the Navy when the Korean War broke out for service in Europe in case that conflict became global. Oh, the ruin. But we, by God, were there, and the submarine pens the British had managed to get a few bombs through, just testing. We saved those people. 
And now because the common agricultural policy would be a little bit inconvenient for them, we are proposing to expand NATO as a surrogate. And may I make a point to my friend, I am sure he knows it, but not everybody does. We say we are expanding the borders of NATO toward Russia. My learned friend knows there is a Russian enclave on the Baltic Sea which is called Kaliningrad, named after one of the original members of the politburo--Stalingrad is gone, Leningrad is gone, Kaliningrad continues--sitting right next to Poland. 
We are not getting close, Mr. President, to the borders of Russia. We are on the borders of Russia. There it is, that little yellow spot--yellow for Russia. It says `Russia.'

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, there would be a lot more people on the Senate floor this afternoon. But, I mean, I could not agree more. You heard George Kennan say, in fact, `Is this the only thing our policymakers in Washington can think to do?' 
Now, the creating of NATO was a big event. It was a proposal by Ernest Bevin, who understood these things in a way that not every American did. There is a nice story that I think Senator Wellstone will enjoy, and you, Mr. President. 
As some people recall--I recall, but I was in the Navy. After V-E Day, the British held an election. They had not had one for 10 years. Suddenly, Churchill and all his Cabinet--out they go. And in comes the Labor Government. Big change. Clement Attlee is Prime Minister. And Ernest Bevin, the sometime head of the Transport and General Workers Union, becomes Foreign Secretary. So he goes off to Potsdam, which is just a suburb of Berlin. And there is Stalin and all his people. And Truman--I doubt whether Harry S. Truman ever met someone he knew to be a Communist until he got to Potsdam and was introduced to Stalin. They do not have many of them in Kansas City. We had lots of them on the west side of Manhattan, but that is another matter. 
This story is apocryphal but true. Bevin comes back from Potsdam, and he is in on the floor of the House of Commons. And a friend comes up to him, a parliamentarian, and says, `Ernie, what are those Soviets like?' And he says, `Well, you know, they're just like the bloody Communists.' 
I mean, there are no shortage of Communists in the Transport and General Workers Union. He could spot their behavior and so forth. It was he who said we had to form a military alliance. The thing nobody in this world wanted was more armies and navies, and so forth, but he knew. And our people responded. 
Harry Truman, who did not know there was an atom bomb being built as Vice President, who had very little contact with any of this--he had been in Europe in World War I--supported it. God, there was a golden age. 
Now, all we can do is expand NATO because the common agriculture policy is making it difficult in Brussels to include the Czech Republic and Poland. That is not the standards we set for ourselves when the cold war began.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I understand your question perfectly, sir, because it is my question. 
And I say this--and I would recommend to anyone who wishes to think about it--if you love Poland, if you think that solidarity was the first real assault on the Soviet system, if you think that Pope John Paul has meant more in advancing freedoms in this age than anybody you can think of, do not do this to Poland. See that Poland is in the European Union, give them a common market, give them the same currency that the Danes will have and the Spanish will have. Give them access to a global market they have never been allowed into. Give them a common agricultural policy that will give their farmers a living. 
That is what they deserve. And that is what is being denied them by the bureaucracies, as bureaucracies will do. And what we do not want is--Poland has had enough in this 20th century. We do not want another period of hostilities that could lead not just to war but to annihilation.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President. I rise as an original sponsor of the resolution acknowledging the historic Northern Ireland peace agreement. In adopting this resolution, the Senate will demonstrate its strong support for this agreement which has been so long in coming. 
When I first came to the Senate in 1977, Senator Kennedy, Speaker O'Neill, then-Governor Hugh Carey of New York, and I joined together and issued this St. Patrick's Day statement: 
We appeal to all those organizations engaged in violence to renounce their campaigns of death and destruction and return to the path of life and peace. And we appeal as well to our fellow Americans to embrace this goal of peace, and to renounce any action that promotes the current violence or provides support or encouragement for organizations engaged in violence. 
Now, finally, one of the oldest conflicts in Europe has the potential of healing and being resolved. A courageous agreement has been reached in Northern Ireland. We in the United States Senate can be particularly proud of the role that our former colleague and leader George Mitchell played in mediating this agreement. He deserves no less than the Nobel Peace Prize. 
The search for a just and lasting peace in Northern Ireland has entered a most promising stage. This resolution indicates the strong support of the United States Senate for this historic agreement. May it fulfill our hopes.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a very important event to the 78,000 plus other graduates of Tufts University--Tuftonia's Day. Tuftonia's day marks the anniversary of Tufts University on this date in 1852 (It is the second oldest college in the Boston area). It is a time for all Tufts students, alumni, professors, and friends of the university to turn their thoughts to Tufts and their fellow Tuftonians. Tufts is my alma mater. I graduated from the university and received both my masters degree and my doctorate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. 
Tufts, a school of 7,800 students, is one of the finest universities in the country and is rated as such by the most recent U.S. News and World Report survey. The main campus is located in Medford, Massachusetts and is home to the Tufts College of Liberal Arts, Jackson College, the College of Engineering, the Boston School of Occupational Therapy, and the Fletcher School. The Dental and Medical schools are downtown on the Boston campus and the School of Veterinary Medicine, the only such school in New England, is located in Grafton, Massachusetts. 
When Charles Tufts founded the college, it is said he wanted to found a `light on the hill.' The first rate education, the wonderful experiences, the enduring friendships, and the values instilled in Tufts students during their years on the hill, shows that Charles Tufts' dream has been realized. 
Mr. President, Tufts University is a wonderful place, and Tuftonia's Day is a special time for all Jumbos (our mascot) to think about our days at Tufts and to pay tribute to our alma mater, the dear old brown and blue. I join with my fellow Tufts alumni in doing so and in recognizing Tuftonia's day.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I congratulate Chairman Roth for his statement and for once again bringing a Finance Committee bill to the floor that includes ideas supported by members on both sides. And I thank the Chairman for insisting that the appropriate place for initial consideration of the Coverdell education savings account legislation was in the Finance Committee, not on the floor. This legislation was reported by the Committee on February 10, 1998, by a vote of 11-8. 
This is one of those infrequent occasions in which the Chairman and I disagree on a policy matter. The good intentions of the proponents of expanding the availability of education individual retirement accounts are clear. However, in our view the proposed changes to the education IRA provisions, passed just last July and effective on January 1st of this year, are fraught with serious policy and technical defects. Secretaries Rubin and Riley have expressed strong opposition to the education IRA provisions in this bill, and have indicated that they will recommend that the President veto a bill that contains such provisions. In a letter to Members of the Finance Committee dated February 9, 1998, the Secretaries of the Treasury and Education stated that the education IRA provisions in this bill would disproportionately benefit the most affluent families and provide little or no benefit to lower and middle-income families. In addition, they indicated that the provisions `would create significant compliance problems.' 
Treasury Department analyses conclude that 70 percent of the tax benefits from this provision would go to the top twenty percent of all income earners. In a memorandum of March 2, 1998, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 52 percent of the tax benefits of the enhanced education IRA provision would go to seven percent of taxpayers: those with dependents already enrolled in private primary or secondary schools. The Joint Committee memorandum indicates that the per tax return benefit for taxpayers with children in private schools will be five times greater than the benefit to taxpayers with children in public schools. 
This bill will not result in greater opportunity for middle and lower income families to send children to private schools, as supporters contend. Instead, it will merely provide new tax breaks to families already able to afford private schools for their children. If the proponents are truly concerned about the middle class, the tax benefits should be targeted there. In order to accomplish this, the income limits would have to be lowered, and the ability to circumvent those limits would have to be prevented. 
Nor will this legislation result in an increase in national savings. The expansion of the education IRA will provide further incentives for taxpayers to shift money to tax-favored accounts, and to spend funds that would otherwise be used for retirement. 
Further, the additional complexity these changes would add to the Internal Revenue Code is of real concern. Taxpayers are just beginning to become aware of the hundreds of changes made in the 1997 tax bill. And now we are considering additional changes to a provision that became effective on January 1, 1998. More confusion for taxpayers; a boon for H&R Block. 
Even as we hear ever louder calls to simplify and even terminate the Code, we have before us a bill that would create a maze of rules in attempting to define what constitutes a `qualified elementary and secondary education expense.' For example, the bill defines such expenses to include computers and related software and services, but how is the IRS to monitor whether a computer, or the use of the Internet, is used by a 
child for educational purposes or for entertainment, or by the child's parents for unrelated purposes? 
Under this bill, the ability to contribute up to $2,000 per year in an account for elementary and secondary education expenses would sunset after 2002. However, money contributed through 2002 could still be used for such expenses. There will be different rules depending on whether contributions were made in 1998, 1999 to 2002, or post-2002. It will be up to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when funds were contributed, the earnings on those funds, and whether they can be used for only higher education, or both elementary and secondary education and higher education. Who will understand these rules? 
Mr. President, we are already spending enough on IRAs and other tax-advantaged savings vehicles. At a cost of $40 billion over 10 years, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created the Education IRA and the Roth IRA, and significantly expanded existing IRAs and the tax benefits of State-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans. 
Having said all of that, I must express thanks to the Chairman, who gave priority in this package to the income exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, which is Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is one of the most successful Federal education policies we have. A million persons per year are provided tax-free higher education by their employers; about a quarter of those are students enrolled in graduate-level education courses. 
In a world of continuing education, Section 127 permits an employer to send an employee to school to learn something new, get a degree, and bring the skills back into the workplace. The employee gets more income, and the Federal treasury gets more tax revenue. This is a program that works, and it administers itself. 
Last year, the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 would have made this absolutely easy; it made Section 127 permanent for both undergraduate and graduate study. For reasons I will never understand, the Senate language was dropped in conference. Members of the House have already indicated that in a conference on this measure they will move to strip the Section 127 provisions, particularly the piece for graduate students. 
Finally, I appreciate the Chairman's good faith efforts in working with members on both sides to try and come up with measures designed to address the issue of school infrastructure. Last year, Senators Carol Moseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the issue of crumbling schools to our attention, and they continue to be the leaders in the effort to address this serious problem. Most of us would prefer not to address this issue via the Tax Code, but previous attempts at more direct solutions have been opposed. I am afraid that such opposition has resulted in the nominal tax provisions we find in this bill to address a problem that is estimated to cost at least $112 billion--a figure that does not include the cost of building new schools. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a milestone will occur on Saturday, April 18, while the Senate is in recess, which I do not want to go unacknowledged: Dr. Richard Hermann Kastner of Clarksburg, Maryland, will celebrate his 75th birthday. 
Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, `. . . to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.' I imagine it would be nearly impossible to count how many lives have `breathed easier' because of Richard Kastner. For nearly 45 years, he has helped individuals and families cope with drug and alcohol dependency, abuse, discord, illness and death, and seemingly inconsolable grief as a psychiatrist and therapist, and as a friend. He has devoted his life to helping others find meaning in their lives. 
Richard Kastner is a native New Yorker. He received a bachelor's degree in psychology and biology from New York University, a master's degree in psychology from the City College of New York, his M.D. from Jefferson Medical College, and his doctorate in psychology from New York University. He then went to the University of Minnesota for post-graduate medical training and for his psychiatric residency, which he then continued at St. Elizabeth's Hospital here in Washington. 
Richard Kastner achieved glittering academic success and then embarked on his career to achieve glittering professional success. He was a captain in the Medical Corps and served as a military psychiatrist at Andrews Air Force Base. He has been a senior psychiatric consultant for the National Security Agency, chief psychiatrist of the Employees Health Service at the National Institutes of Health, and a consulting senior psychiatrist and lecturer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He also served as an instructor in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard University's School of Medicine, and is a Fellow in the Royal Society of Medicine. He is a pilot, husband, and father of three children. 
Even now, as he turns 75, he maintains a robust private practice, undeterred by age, ailment, or surgery. I suppose the animating force is an unquenchable desire to help others. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate him on his 75th birthday and wish him many more.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself fully with the remarks of my distinguished colleague from New York. Kodak has compiled volumes of evidence, based on more than 100 years of experience in the Japanese market, that clearly document the thicket of laws and regulations that have the intent--and the effect--of curbing sales of foreign photographic film and paper. Through an elaborate system of restrictions on sales and distribution, Japan has succeeded in severely limiting market access for foreign film and paper. 
Nearly three years ago, on May 18, 1995, Kodak filed a petition with the U.S. Trade Representative under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, urging action on the broad range of trade barriers. After a formal investigation, Ambassador Barshefsky found that Japan's practices were indeed in violation of our trade laws, and dispute settlement proceedings in the World Trade Organization were begun. The verdict from the WTO, issued in its final form on January 30, 1998, was a great disappointment. But certainly not the end of the argument, nor the end of Kodak's attempts to penetrate the Japanese market. 
The resolution that I am pleased to cosponsor today emphatically endorses the initiative that Ambassador Barshefsky and Secretary Daley unveiled on February 3, 1998, which will put the Government of Japan to the test. During the course of the WTO proceedings, as my colleagues are aware, the Japanese Government asserted that its market was fully open to foreign film and paper. And so our government has proposed that we monitor that proposition, by collecting data and examining, every six months, the progress that Kodak--and other foreign suppliers--have made in competing in the Japanese film and paper market. 
This initiative is worthy of our support, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of Bella S. Abzug. While we began our association as political rivals, past quickly became past, and I came to respect and admire her as a friend and colleague. 
She served three terms in the United States Congress with extraordinary distinction, establishing an unparalleled record of commitment to women's issues that would distinguish her career. With a rare combination of intellect, energy, and wit, Bella properly won a place on the national stage. And she did not stop there--in short order Bella Abzug became an international figure. As President of the Women's Environment and Development Organization, she added her voice to a wide range of international debates with a style that was all her own. Bella's stature was such that in 1995 she was selected to lead a delegation of United States nongovernmental organizations to the United Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, China. She made us proud. 
To know Bella Abzug was to know a woman of indefatigable passion for the fray. Regardless of the issue, whenever New Yorkers needed an outspoken advocate, Bella could be counted on to lead the charge. She will be missed.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and neighbor from New Jersey, the manager on our side, and my friend Senator Conrad of the Finance Committee, for his remarks. 
Mr. President, I rise not so much in opposition to the proposal by the esteemed chairman of our committee, as to see if it is not possible to clarify some of these issues. And to welcome the Senate to what should be a substantive, constructive debate over the next 6 months--pending the time when our distinguished Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Franklin D. Raines, has indicated the administration plans to begin to have legislation on this issue, in the first session of the next Congress. In my view, we ought to take up such legislation as a first order of business in that session. 
May I take the presumed responsibility of this body, which tends to have long tenure, to give a bit of history? In 1935, we established the Social Security system on a pay-as-you-go basis. It was no time, in the midst of a great economic depression, to take more money out of the economy than was being put back, even if it was only a nominal process. 
This went on until 1977 when we moved from a pay-as-you-go system to a partially funded system. I was a member of the committee of conference between the Senate and the House which adopted that change, and I can say there was very little attention paid to it. We put in place a huge surplus to provide for the baby boom retirement, as the phrase was. But we did not put in place any mechanism to save that surplus. 
Indeed, if I look around the horizon of political economy, I do not think there is any such mechanism. You can strengthen an economy by paying down debt such that the private sector grows. Theoretically you could build warehouses and fill them with cans of Campbell soup to be opened in 30 years time. But in a system of this kind, a defined benefit arrangement for retirement and for survivors and the disabled--only 62 percent of persons receiving Social Security benefits are retired persons; the rest are spouses and children of persons who have died, and the disabled--there is no way to save a surplus. 
The result was that for 21, now 22 years, we have had each year a large surplus from the payroll tax. This is what Senator Conrad was speaking about. And we have used it for other reasons altogether. We have abused it because at a minimum we have never let our debt be paid down so our private savings and investment would rise as an absolute reciprocal, as mathematicians say. For every dollar of debt you pay down you get a dollar of savings that will be used for private investment. 
Instead, we used this money to conceal the enormity of the deficits we ran in the 1980s and which we now have gotten past. We are now down to a stable situation, not yet one of surplus, because we still have this money coming in from the partially funded system we put in place in 1977 with a very regressive, high payroll tax, 12.4 percent of payroll, paid on the first dollar of income and up to $68,400 this year. 
But this is no longer much of a surplus. The numbers are approximately this, and I say approximately because we won't know for another year or so, but next year the combined costs of old age and survivors and disability insurance, plus hospital insurance, will be roughly equal to the combined payroll tax revenues for these two programs; thereafter you are in deficit. Technically, there are Treasury bonds that can be cashed in, but then you have to get general revenue or borrow more to convert them into benefits. 
By about the year 2010, there is no longer any surplus in the primary OASDI, Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. We have 11 years until there is nothing left there either. 
Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and I have introduced legislation that we think accommodates the situation we are in which, first of all, does not save Social Security. Social Security does not need to be saved. What it does not need is to be destroyed. There is now abroad a powerful ideological movement to turn the system of retirement benefits and survivors benefits over to personal savings in the market. This is a legitimate idea, but I am not sure, if it were understood, it would be a very popular idea. 
It puts at risk much more than we would ever wish to do in terms of the entire population. It translates the experience of successful entrepreneurial people in an age of great economic growth into a proposition that this is something that the whole of the population can and ought to want to do. 
We have a plan which does two things: One, it secures Social Security as a defined benefit for retired persons, for disabled persons, for survivors indefinitely. Simultaneously, it provides for lowering payroll taxes and allowing the difference to be used for just the kind of personal savings accounts, investment accounts, that our friend from Delaware would like to do. 
Specifically, we move from the current 12.4 percent payroll tax--half of it by the employee, half by the employer--to 10.4. That will pay your benefits for more than 30 years; thereafter the payroll tax is gradually increased to a combined 13.4 percent thereby, with some other adjustments I will mention, securing the system for more than a century. Then we say give the employee the option of taking his or her 1 percent as income--some will do that; young persons will do, no doubt--or having the 2 percent deposited into some kind of thrift savings plan. 
We have such an arrangement in the Federal Government. You can contribute part of your salary, which the Federal Government matches. There is a booklet, and you pick the kind of investment you would like. Some people like index funds, bonds, mutual funds--there are a whole range of these products, as they are called, and you can pick what you wish, and from time to time you can change, if you wish. 
The prospect for the average earner with a 2 percent investment is that, after contributing for 45 years into the system, the worker would have a nominal asset from that 2 percent contribution in the range of $400,000. This would mean Americans would have an estate. They could leave something to their grandchildren, who might even be more attentive given that prospect. 
We have an idea of an America very different from the world of the 1930s and the system we put in place, which was put in place in Europe in the 1880s. We have an idea of a retirement system in which persons begin to have a three-tiered system: You have your Social Security, a fixed amount, an annuity. You have benefits from private pensions that you earned with your employer. About half of American workers now have such. And then you have income, if you wish it, from your savings and investment accounts. 
That requires a few other changes. It requires that we get an accurate cost-of-living index by which to adjust the benefits for changes in the cost of living. We do not now have one. There is a small group of economists who dissent, but the overwhelming judgment of the profession is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index is not a cost-of-living index, which the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics insists it is not. They do not misrepresent their product; it is we who misuse it. 
I will say that again. The Department of Labor does not misrepresent its Consumer Price Index; it is we who misuse it. We began the practice in 1972 at a time when Social Security benefits were the object of a biannual auction on the House and Senate floors as Members rose to say, `I propose we raise benefits 5 percent,' then 10 percent, then 15 percent. I think on one occasion we went up 20 percent. We had to stop that. The nearest thing at hand was the CPI. We can make a correction. 
A committee of distinguished economists, headed by Professor Michael Boskin, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush, reported to the Committee on Finance a year and a half ago recommending a correction of 1.1 percentage points. 
Different economists, different Government officials, have different judgments, but they are almost all in the same range. And just at this moment, the principal economic planners of the U.S. Government do not use the CPI as a measure of inflation. They just don't; they know otherwise. 
We have to gradually increase the age of retirement to 70, as we do in our bill, way into the next century. Under current law, we are already approaching an increase to 67. The majority of beneficiaries, Mr. President, retire at age 62 at a reduced benefit, which is actuarially sound. 
We get rid of that dumb earnings test. It wasn't dumb in 1935 when we were encouraging people not to be in the labor force. Right now, if you work between ages 62 and 70, you lose some or all of your benefits. At age 70 and above, you would then get increased benefits. That is, you receive the same benefits over the course of your retirement. Under our bill, you can decide when to collect your benefits, regardless of whether you are working. You don't have to fool around. 
We would tax these benefits at the rate at which ordinary pension income is taxed. May I say, Mr. President, for a very, very large number of our present recipients, particularly the old ones, their Social Security benefit and any other income they might have is so low that they pay no Federal taxes of any kind and would not pay any taxes under this new proposal. 
But I say that this can be done, but it won't be done if we don't understand that we are dealing with a group, a body of respectable opinion, that basically thinks Social Security is a failed plan, perhaps never should have been put in place and now should be transitioned out. This is not the view of the Senator from Delaware. He would like to see a basic annuity for all Americans continue. But it is the view of many more people than we know, or perhaps are aware of, or perhaps are collected in a coherent manner. 
This morning in the Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Gingrich spoke very much in these terms. Typically, Senator Dole, who appeared as a witness, did not. The problem is, right now there are groups who are so attached to the present system that they will not make the changes necessary to maintain the present system. It is painful. They know who they are. If I may say, the White House knows who they are. I daresay there aren't many of us in the Finance Committee who do not know. But they must recognize that the alternative is the loss of everything we have developed over 60 years, 60 years in which the system has never been a day late or dollar short on any payment, but which has somehow lost the confidence of the public. I ask my distinguished friend for another 2 minutes to conclude.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to make this point. I want to shout this point at the American people: They are trying to scare you out of your Social Security. You don't think you are going to get it now. Why, I am not sure. But ask anyone on the streets at home. Ask someone in their thirties or in their 
forties. The polls are clear. People do not expect to get it. Partly this is bad management at the Social Security Administration. It got lost in the HEW and then HHS. 
In 1994, we re-created it as an independent agency with an independent Administrator, but the SSA never tells people that the agency knows their name, what they are going to get in benefits, and that they are on top of this. 
I say it right now, there are people who would like to scare you into thinking you are not going to get Social Security, so don't worry about it when they take it away, and what they are going to make you instead is a millionaire in the stock market. I don't think that will happen. I don't think it should. I think we should allow the accommodation of both. I think we should begin, if I can use a term from the academy, to demystify some of these claims, not by Senator Roth, who is loyal to this institution. He has been on the Finance Committee for 30 years and has helped maintain the system. 
But there are those who are out to do away with it. Why, I do not know. They take as their model the system in the Nation of Chile, a nation of some 12 million people, I believe, a system developed under General Pinochet, which does not immediately suggest sound social policy or equity. I don't say there is anything wrong with their system, but there is nothing wrong with ours either. It is ours to maintain. We should do it, and we should not let our people be frightened into giving up something so important to them and to their children and to their parents. 
I thank my friend for giving me this time. I regretfully have to say that while I very much endorse the idea of personal savings accounts, right now we should use the surplus money we have to pay down the debt, increase investment, and get on with the simple changes we need to make this system permanent and stable. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the manager for his courtesy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in emphasizing the importance of providing adequate assistance to the dairy farmers of the Northeast, who suffered tremendous losses due to the ice storm of January 1998. Our amendment will address an important gap in the Dairy and Livestock Disaster Assistance Program described in the supplemental--by providing for compensation for diminished milk production for the remainder of this year. 
In the days and weeks following the January ice storm, my staff met with dairy farmers from upstate New York, and listened while they detailed the extent and the nature of their losses. My staff realized that one of the main needs expressed by our farmers--compensation for the diminished production which they knew would ensue for the remainder of the year--was not being addressed. Working with the New York Farm Service Agency, my staff developed an approach which will provide crucial assistance to our farmers for these losses. I am pleased to see that compensation for diminished milk production is included in this amendment. 
Without electric power, farmers were unable to use electrical milking machines, in some cases for several days. Veterinarians at Cornell University estimate that two days of missed milkings will result in an average loss in milk production of ten percent for the remainder of the lactation cycle. The situation is analogous to damages to fruit trees, which suffer production losses in the months--or years--following a storm, in addition to the initial losses suffered at the time of the storm. 
Diminished milk production losses will greatly surpass the value of milk dumped at the time of the storm. For example, in New York, the value of milk dumped in the days immediately following the storm is estimated to be $1 million. The New York Farm Service Agency projects $12 million in losses due to diminished milk production. Dairy farmers in Vermont and Maine will be similarly affected. 
The amount provided for dairy and livestock in the Administration's request--$4 million--drastically under represents the amount of damage. The $10 million which this amendment will provide for dairy and livestock farmers is based on the best estimates of damages available from the Farm Service Agencies of the affected states. Through this amendment, we will be able to compensate dairy farmers for 30 percent of the value of their demonstrated losses--the same proportion provided to other farmers under previous disaster relief programs. 
The farmers of the Northeast dairy industry do not have sufficient means of emergency support outside of Federal aid. Many farmers were shocked to find that their private insurance policies, which do cover losses sustained due to fires, floods, and other natural disasters, will not cover damages sustained during ice storms. The states of New York, Maine and Vermont are offering limited assistance to their dairy farmers, but additional Federal aid is sorely needed. 
Mr. President, I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for their assistance with this amendment.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there is an article in the Metro section of today's Washington Post, `A New Way to See the Future,' about a small school which is going about the difficult business of reclaiming young people here in the District of Columbia. The school, which is called See Forever, was started by two lawyers, David Domenici and James Forman, Jr. See Forever--on its way to becoming a charter school--only enrolls those students who have become `entangled' in the D.C. court system. The regime consists of a regimented schedule, strict discipline, core classes and electives, participation in a school-run catering service, and paid internships (the money from which is put into Merrill Lynch investment funds, which the students learn to manage). The school runs 12 months a year, and 10 and one-half hours a day. The youngsters enrolled are turning their lives around; they are beating the odds. 
Adlai E. Stevenson once remarked of Eleanor Roosevelt that she `would rather light candles than curse the darkness.' So it seems with David Domenici and James Forman, Jr. (whose father was active in the civil rights movement a generation ago). Of course, knowing David's father--the senior Senator from New Mexico--it is not surprising at all that David should dedicate his life to helping those less fortunate. 
Mr. President, throughout the course of our nation's history, we have seen the shift from labor to capital--in agriculture, in manufacturing, etc. But there is one enterprise that remains stubbornly labor-intensive, if we are to do it properly. And that enterprise is raising our children, especially those who are socially and economically disadvantaged. David Domenici and James Forman, Jr. understand. The student-teacher ratio at See Forever is 5-1, and more than sixty volunteers help tutor the twenty or so students. 
Two years ago, I published a book on social policy, `Miles to Go.' I ended that book by saying, 
Even were governments specifically qualified for such work, which is to say the restoration of individual character and moral instruction in everyday life, the national government has entered a time of chronic, even disabling fiscal stricture. . . It is a time for small platoons; a time possibly to be welcomed for such can move quickly, and there are miles to go. 
David Domenici and James Forman, Jr. have formed one such `small platoon' and we--and the lives of those whom they touch--are lucky for it.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. This is Kaliningrad right here, cut off from Russia by Lithuania, Belarus, and Latvia. 
I would like to make a point that the Russians have already asked for passage through Latvia and have not received it. 
One point about the proposal of the Senator from Virginia to have a pause before further expansion. Last December, the Woodrow Wilson National Center for Scholars had a conference on NATO enlargement, and there was just this one passage that struck me by a Finnish scholar Tiiu Pohl. She said, `In 1994, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung of Germany organized a study of the Russian military elite to find out whom they considered to be enemies of the state. 
The results of the research showed that Latvia was named most frequently, by 49 percent of the respondents. Latvia was followed by Afghanistan, Lithuania, and Estonia. After Estonia came the United States.' 
Sir, we are walking into historical ethnic and religious enmities. Catholics here, Orthodox here, and Lutheran here. We have no idea what we are getting into. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I wanted to respond to his wonderful, vivid image of an iron ring surrounding Central Europe and facing Russia. Would my friend not agree--and of course, he will agree because it is a fact of geography--that Russian territory will be within that ring? The simple fact that Poland will be in NATO means that Kaliningrad will border NATO though it is cut off from the rest of Russia. It is cut off, in any event, by Lithuania and Belarus, but I don't have to tell the former Secretary of the Navy that, other than Sebastopol in the Black Sea, the main port of what was the navy of the Soviet Union is in Kaliningrad. 
We may expand NATO beyond that. Surely that cannot but cause anxiety in Russia.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I would like to first thank my friend from Virginia. We have reached across the aisle to collaborate on two amendments which we will offer at the appropriate time. Today we are engaged in just some preliminary observations. 
I will begin with the current event of one of the more interesting aspects of life in Moscow at this moment, which is that it is in so many ways much more open than the United States. Their archives are open, and their national security plans are open. I do not doubt there are closed elements as well. But on December 17, the Russian Federation issued Presidential edict, No. 1300, entitled `The Russian National Security Blueprint.' 
This is the kind of document that we would not have gotten from Moscow in the past. We can think of the famous NSC-68, which was drafted early in 1950 and was so powerfully influential in our affairs for many years. NSC-68 remained secret for 30 years. By contrast, the Presidential edict, No. 1300, was published in Moscow's official gazette on December 26, 9 days after it was issued. It is a disturbing document; yet, in many ways it is an admirable one in the clarity with which it sets forth the exceptional difficulties facing the Russian Federation at this point. It speaks in its first paragraph that: 
The Russian Federation National Security Blueprint is a political document reflecting the aggregate of officially accepted views regarding the goals and state strategy in the sphere of assuring the security of the individual and the state from external and internal threats of a political, economic, social, military, manmade, ecological, informational, or other nature in the light of existing resources and potential. 
It speaks of internal threats in the context of the convulsions that have occurred in that country within the past decade. The forces which played such a fundamental role in breaking up the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. It is a sober assessment of the threats to Russian security. 
Madam President, in this debate it should be recorded that the national security document, the guiding principles of the Russian Federation, states right up front: 
The prospect of NATO expansion to the east is unacceptable to Russia since it represents a threat to its national security. 
That was drafted, or agreed to, on December 17 and published December 26. It is a formidable document and an extraordinarily candid one. It speaks to the ethnic problems, it speaks to the economic decline, it speaks to poverty, it speaks to unemployment, and it speaks to the nature of the Russian defense forces. 
They acknowledge that large portions of their borders are undefended. They acknowledge that their traditional conventional weapons systems are deteriorated, if not in fact disfunctional. And they say--and this is the most difficult part--that they do have nuclear weapons and, if necessary, they will use them. 
This is not the type of posture that we had hoped for, after the long arms control efforts from President Eisenhower's time to START II. I was one of the Senate observers to the START II talks and the present Russian Ambassador to the United States, who wrote a very important article recently in the Washington Post, was one of the negotiators then. With START, for the first time we agreed to build our nuclear forces down. Previous agreements had really legitimated the respective nations' plans to increase their nuclear forces. We reached that historic moment, and have been able to build on that important achievement. Since then, other historic treaties have also been achieved, allowing eminent Senators, such as the Senator from Delaware, to bring to this floor the Chemical Weapons Agreement, a very powerful, far-sighted document. 
But now the Russian government says, under the circumstances, we have nothing left but nuclear weapons. We are in serious difficulty. The prospect of NATO expansion to the east is unacceptable. The term is `unacceptable.' It is not a calculating document. 
May I make this point twofold? I would like to go back just a bit. There is not one of us in this body who has not paid some heed to the affairs of the Soviet Union over time and the world of communism over time. Yet rather early on it began to occur to some of us that all was not well in that arrangement and that it was not going to remain permanent as was often presumed. 
Just a short while ago, Arkady Shevchenko documented--and his obituary appeared in the principal national papers. Arkady Shevchenko was the second ranking official at the United Nations during the time when I had the honor to be our Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Shevchenko was a protege of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko. He was on anyone's short list to succeed Gromyko. He held one essentially attractive position after another. There he was, the Under Secretary General responsible for the Security Council, about as important a position as you will get in any diplomatic service and particularly in that of the Soviet Union. 
Whilst I was at that post in New York, Shevchenko defected to the United States. It was a very closely held matter. He simply passed a note in a book in the General Assembly library, that he was thinking of defecting. He was a man at the top of his form. In the manner of the espionage craft, we established that he had defected and then left him in place for some two and one half years, where he remained in his position as Under Secretary General whilst providing us information. 
In Moscow they began to sense something was the matter and they began to think a defector was in place. It even got to the point where the Soviet Ambassador here in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, another person of great stature in the Soviet system, came under suspicion as the source of the security leaks. Finally, they worked it out. That is not too hard. You give three messages to three different people and you see which one the United States gets. Shevchenko had to defect. He later moved to Washington, where I got to know him. I had known him somewhat at the United Nations, but I got to know him better here.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, if I could say to my friend from Delaware, that is when I became convinced the Soviet Union would not last through the 20th century. When a person of Arkady N. Shevchenko stature defects, it means the system is not working. And it did not work. But when it came apart, there is a proposition in which Owen Harries, in a very fine article in The National Interest, cites British historian Martin Wight who observed that `Great Power status is lost, as it is won, by violence. A Great Power does not die in its bed.' 
Of all the extraordinary events of the 20th century, nothing is more important, more striking than the fact that the Soviet Union and that whole world empire died in bed. There was virtually no bloodshed. The only bloodshed that really took place occurred within the remaining Russian Federation, with its many different languages and regions, when you began to get things like Chechnya and the appearance of a Russian army that clearly was not capable of fairly elementary military operations. 
I say that is a beleaguered and troubled society. And one that could have resisted, in the first instance, the Polish defection. They could have resisted others. They had an army; they had an air force; they had nuclear strategic and tactical weapons. They did not, Owen Harries argued--a man, I must say, of impeccable conservative credentials--that there was an implicit understanding that we would not take advantage of what the Soviet Union was allowing to happen to their empire. They gave up everything they had hoped for from 1917. They collapsed. And they recognized their failure. 
Again, we had been picking up things like that in the mid-1970s. Murray Feshbach, a distinguished demographer here at the Bureau of the Census, noted that life expectancy for Soviet males was declining. It wasn't working. It was all a lie. 
If I could relate one more event as a bit of an anecdote but not without some interest. Our distinguished Ambassador at the time has related it as well. In 1987, I was in Moscow on a mission of possible importance. It had to do with the infiltration of our new Embassy with listening devices and things like that. We were treated with great courtesy. We were presented a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier. We visited Lenin's tomb. We were shown Lenin's apartment. I was struck; behind Lenin's desk there were four bookshelves, two shelves of English books and two of French. Now, I expect they were put there for the delectation of George Bernard Shaw and Lady Astor in the 1930s, but still there they were. And I recognized that I had met three of those authors. I can not say I was intimate with them, but I had met them. 
Two days later we called on Boris Yeltsin, who was then a candidate member of the politburo. This was August, and he had the duty to stay in town in August while the rest were off in the Crimean. To be friendly, I said, well, we were in Lenin's apartment looking over his books and I knew three of those people. Isn't that interesting? And it was very clear, as the U.N. Ambassador said, that Yeltsin had never heard of any of these authors and could care less; he hadn't read a book since he had left technical school. There was not a person left in the politburo who believed any of that. 
I say to my friend from Delaware, Yeltsin said to me, `I know who you are. I know where you are from. And what I want to know is how am I supposed to run Moscow with 1929 rent controls?' This was the level of ideological discourse. 
It was a sick society, wounded. It collapsed, died. And what is left is fragile, and they have just formally proclaimed both their vulnerability and their determination that if NATO is expanded, the no-first-use principle, which saved mankind in the 20th century, is over because all they have to defend themselves are nuclear weapons. It is a curiously ironic outcome that at the end of the cold war we might face a nuclear Armageddon. 
I leave it there. I have nothing more to add at this moment. 
But I ask, Madam President, if I might have excerpts printed from the Russian National Security Blueprint in the Congressional Record.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am sure that the distinguished Senator from Colorado has other appointments he has to meet and will have to leave the floor shortly. 
But could I congratulate him on his remarks, and to say that we are about to introduce a bill, the Social Security Solvency Act of 1998, that is almost precisely the one he contemplates, or is in that range of reference. For his particular concern, we reduce the present 12.4 percent payroll tax by 2 percentage points, to 10.4. That puts us on a pay-as-you-go system, which with other adjustments, particularly the cost-of-living adjustment, means we will never go much above 13.4 percent, and we stay at 12.4 all the way to the year 2045. And then we give to each worker-employee the option of having 2 percent, the reduction in tax under our bill, put into a personal savings account--not very different from the Federal Thrift Savings Plan in which you have a whole catalog of mutual funds of various kinds in which you can invest. 
The magic of compound interest is extraordinary. The Wall Street Journal this morning comments on this proposal and notes that--well, I will just read it:  
Why shouldn't working stiffs have the same chance others have to exploit the magic of compound interest? Mr. Moynihan shows that workers earning $30,000 a year-- 
Which is not a high income at this time-- can at a modest 5 percent return amass $450,000 in savings after 45 years. 
By just shifting that 2 percent. 
And this gives workers something they have not had in the past. It gives them an estate they can pass on to their children. Oh, heavens, I am about to say something which I suppose should be stricken from the Record, but it will make them all Republicans. Still, it is very much in line with the Senator's comments. I very much appreciate what he has said, and I congratulate him on doing so.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing the Social Security Solvency Act of 1998. I do so in the distinguished company of my friend from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey. This is a matter which we have just heard two distinguished Senators from the other side of the aisle say requires that we attend to, and soon. The President has asked us to devote this year to a national conversation on this subject. The Pew Charitable Trusts are beginning a series of forums across the country on the matter, and the prospect that we can reach some kind of a consensus is good, if we have just enough courage to do the few necessary things. 
I perhaps would start out by saying that we can save Social Security, and I don't use those words lightly, because Social Security is in jeopardy. In about 14 years' time Social Security outlays will exceed revenues. In a generation's time, there will be a huge gap between what is owed and what is received, and the mood will be to scrap the whole system as a relic of the 1930s, as, indeed, an inheritance from Bismarckian Germany. It predates the global economy of the present and the wide participation of our population in personal savings accounts and mutual funds and such matters. 
My distinguished friend from Nebraska and I have been thinking about this for a good long while. He has introduced important measures, and we now bring to the Senate floor and to the consideration of the Congress a matured proposal. May I say that we have worked very closely with the actuaries at the Social Security Administration, now an independent agency once again. We have worked with the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. The numbers we present in this measure are, as near as they can be, accurate and agreed to by objective authorities who have no politics of any kind. 
I shall describe the essence of the bill very briefly as I see both the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and another distinguished colleague on the Finance Committee, the Senator from Louisiana, on the floor. Our proposal is as simple as can be. We say go back to pay-as-you-go. That is the principle on which we began Social Security in 1935. We changed it in 1977 to a partially funded system. The payroll tax rose and rose again; 80 percent of American taxpayers now pay more in payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes. And the surplus has been used for other things altogether, it being the necessary fact that you cannot save it in any of the senses that an individual can save. 
We propose to reduce the payroll tax from 12.4 percent to 10.4 percent. As you can see on this chart, our present arrangement would lead us, by the year 2070, to 18 percent of payroll--and it might even be higher. Under this legislation we stay at 10.4 until the year 2030, and then only very slightly go up in mid-21st century to 13 percent and a little more. 
Our second proposal is to allow employees--workers--to opt that the 2 percent reduction in their present rate of taxation be put into a personal savings account. The Social Security Administration would present an array of different options, just as the Federal Thrift Savings Plan does now, from very conservative to more speculative, or a combination thereof. There are plenty of such options available. And at rather modest returns, given what 
John Maynard Keynes called `the magic of compound interest,' you would see a worker who put in 45 years, let us say--as I remarked in the paper I gave at the John F. Kennedy School on Monday which describes this--a worker who spent 45 years with the Bethlehem Steel Company could easily find himself with an estate of half a million dollars. The worker could pass on that wealth to his or her heirs. 
Retirement has been for some time taking up about one-quarter of the adult life. We would gradually raise the retirement age to continue at that ratio. A person retiring would have that basic annuity of Social Security, frequently--not always, but increasingly--a pension earned in his or her working life from the firm involved, and the returns on the personal savings account. This is an extraordinary possibility. The one essential that makes it possible is that we establish a correct cost-of-living index, such that the value of the Social Security annuity is maintained but not overstated. This is something on which I believe the great majority of economists now agree. I was impressed, and I will close now, with a statement by Robert A. Pollak, the Hernreich Distinguished Professor of Economics at Washington University, in the Winter 1998 Journal of Economic Perspectives, a journal of the American Economic Association, just available, in which he says we ought to do two things. One is leave the CPI as it has been since 1918, keep its integrity. It is not a cost-of-living index; the Bureau of Labor Statistics which computes it so states. But then have the necessary political will to correct cost of living adjustments by 1 percentage point, which was the proposal of the commission headed by Professor Michael J. Boskin, of Stanford University, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. As Professor Pollak writes:  
[O]n the political side--and here I step outside my role as an economist and an expert on the CPI--I recommend modifying not the CPI but the procedure used to index tax brackets and transfer payments. More specifically, I recommend that the CPI be left alone pending the report of the committee of technical experts I have proposed, but that, pending their report and action on it, tax brackets and transfer payments be escalated by the CPI minus one percentage point. I recommend one percentage point not because it is my estimate of the amount by which the CPI overstated the rate of inflation in some particular year but because of its resemblance to what game theorists call a `focal point.' A change in the indexation formula rather than in the procedure used to calculate the CPI would accomplish two desirable goals. First, it would maintain the integrity and credibility of the CPI and, thus would do nothing to further erode trust in government. Second, it would recognize that the procedure currently used to index tax brackets and benefit payments is working badly--that is it has become too expensive and is leading to excessive transfers from young workers to the elderly. As a political matter, I would like to see these transfers reduced, but the responsibility for reducing them belongs to elected politicians, not to unelected economists. 
Mr. President, we are all agreed on this. We only have to do it. It is not a complicated matter, but it is a daunting one because it requires courage. There are now veto groups which will say, `Don't change this system.' All public arrangements acquire such groups. In the end they will defeat themselves. And in a sense we have to save them from themselves. But to do so takes courage. If I may say, that is one of the reasons I am particularly proud to be associated in this matter with my gallant friend from Nebraska, who has shown remarkable courage in his lifetime in battle overseas and at home, where he has been willing to tell truths that were not always welcome but were very necessary.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. If you think of the prospect of retirement benefits, and that is real, but something that is not always recognized--I know the Senator understands it--only 62 percent of the beneficiaries of Social Security at this moment are retirees. The rest are survivors or persons who have been disabled, and that can be someone 24 years old or 35 years old. This is a system that is not just devoted to the elderly. Keeping it is essential, and we can do it. I cannot tell you how much I am honored by you associating yourself with this proposal.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I do not think there are 100 people in the country who understand the formulas by which you have a higher rate of benefit for persons with lower incomes, but it has been there from the beginning. It is a very progressive program in that regard. 
That level of general unawareness, as the Senator knows, is a threatening fact, that a majority of nonretired adults think they will never get Social Security, not knowing they might need it for other purposes. If they don't think they will get it, they won't miss it if it is taken away. That is why we had better act now, and soon, and with a measure of courage that the people who created this institution showed in 1934, 1935.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to provide access to health insurance for individuals between the ages of 55-65. These individuals are too young for Medicare, not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, and in many cases, are forced into early retirement or pushed out of their jobs in corporate downsizing. 
The `Medicare Early Access Act' is based on the President's three-part initiative announced on January 6, 1998. The bill is a targeted, self-financing proposal to give older Americans under 65 new options to obtain health insurance coverage. Many of these Americans have worked hard all their lives, but, through no fault of their own, find themselves uninsured just as they are entering the years when the risk of serious illness is increasing. This legislation attempts to bridge the gap in coverage between years when persons are in the labor and the age--(65) when they become eligible for Medicare. 
The bill has three parts: (1) It enables persons between ages 62 and 64 to buy into Medicare by paying a full premium; (2) it provides displaced workers over age 55 access to Medicare by offering a similar Medicare buy-in option; and (3) it extends COBRA coverage to persons 55 and over whose employers withdraw retiree health benefits. A more detailed description of the proposal is attached.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise on this great day in honor of Ireland's legendary saint and pay special tribute to two venerable New York City institutions bearing his name. St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, dedicated in 1815, and St. Patrick's Old Cathedral School, opened in 1822, have served the citizens of New York for nearly two centuries. 
Throughout the Cathedral and School's history, Old St. Patrick's priests, nuns, parishioners and students have contributed so very much to the betterment of New York City. Most famously, Saint Patrick's parishioners and their erstwhile leader Bishop John Hughes helped define the course of American immigration in the 1830's when they refused to let nativists prevent Catholics, mostly poor Irish at the time, from establishing themselves in New York City. Their heroic efforts included an 1835 standoff in front of Saint Patrick's in which an anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant mob gathered to destroy the Cathedral. The Cathedral stood, and with it America's first large immigrant population. 
Nearby, Saint Patrick's Old Cathedral School has served as a lead model for many of New York City's parochial schools. Founded by the Sisters of Charity, the schoolhouse on Mott Street has offered for 176 years the hope and opportunity of a strong education to tens of thousands of mostly poor, immigrant students. 
Recently, I had the good fortune to revisit Saint Patrick's Old Cathedral and the Old Cathedral School and am delighted to report that these institutions remain remarkably unchanged in their caring mission and spirit. The good works abound under the leadership of a newly appointed pastor, Father Keith Fennessy. I look forward to working with him and others in celebrating next year's two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Lorenzo Da Ponte's birth. Da Ponte, who was Mozart's librettist, was a parishioner, and his funeral mass was celebrated at Old St. Patrick's. Unfortunately, Da Ponte, like Mozart, ended up in a mass grave. Next year provides the nation a chance to celebrate the life of one of the greatest librettists, and one of the most influential Italian-Americans in our history. I eagerly anticipate my return to Old St. Patrick's for these events. 
By serving the surrounding neighborhoods, Saint Patrick's Old Cathedral and Saint Patrick's Old Cathedral School remain as vital as they were almost two centuries ago. Thus, I extend my gratitude to these institutions for their vital work on this great day of thanks for their patron saint, St. Patrick.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Eric Breindel, a proud son of New York who was taken from us all too suddenly and all too soon this past Saturday. Eric lived life at a hectic pace, almost as if he knew that his years would be so painfully limited that he would do well to fill as much meaning and involvement as he could into every single day. The Talmud teaches that fools measure their lives in years, while wise people measure them in days. Eric was wise in this respect as he was in so many others. 
As I noted in his funeral on Monday, `I taught him for two years at Harvard and learned from him for the next twenty.' His passion for the truth, for justice, for democracy, were all well reflected in the editorial pages of the New York Post, where he presided for eleven madcap years as the editorial page editor. I ask unanimous consent to place in the Congressional Record his obituary from The New York Times and the Post's tribute to this brilliant journalist and passionate American.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wish to salute my distinguished colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Chairman Chafee of Rhode Island, Senator Baucus of Montana, and Senator Warner of Virginia, for their leadership and vision in crafting ISTEA II. I also wish to salute my fellow New Yorker, Senator D'Amato and Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, for their outstanding work on the transit title of this bill and the careful compromise they were able to fashion. Finally, I congratulate Senator Roth of Delaware, for all his skill on crafting the tax title to ISTEA II. 
In 1991, Congress developed the principles for the first highway bill to mark the post-Interstate era. That previous era had seen development of a nationwide, multi-lane, limited access highway system, as first envisioned at the General Motors Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair, and then funded by a dedicated tax proposed by President Eisenhower and approved by Congress in 1956. 
Those principles were designed to address the fundamental imbalance in national transportation investment, and in so doing, promote intermodalism, improve mobility and access to jobs, protect the environment, increase participation by local communities, and enhance transportation safety. 
ISTEA spurred the Federal government and the States to invest their transportation dollars in whatever modes were most efficient for moving people and goods and to solicit the input of local communities in planning those investments. The result was a dramatic increase in investment in maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads and bridges, in mass transit, and in creative approaches to our transportation needs, from bicycle and pedestrian paths to ferry boats. 
I am proud to see that the bill we will pass today is true to those principles, retaining ISTEA I's major environmental programs such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program and the Transportation Enhancements Program, as well as creating a new innovative finance program that will help fund projects across the nation. This bill is good for New York, providing the State with over $14 billion in highway and transit funds over the next six years. 
I also salute the EPW Committee for including a program to develop magnetic levitation projects in this country. Maglev was first conceived in 1960 by a young Brookhaven scientist, James Powell, as he sat mired in traffic on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. But it is the Germans and Japanese who are building it. It promises to be the most important development in transportation technology since the airplane and we must not be left behind. 
I want to close with a word about mass transit. One of the most important things that ISTEA I accomplished was to begin the work of repairing the damage done to our cities by the Interstate Highway System. American cities were cruelly split, their character and geography changed forever, with interstate highways running through once-thriving working class neighborhoods from Newark to Detroit to Miami. Homes and jobs were dispersed to the outlying suburbs and beyond. The physical and economic damage is still with us today. 
But our cities have used ISTEA funds to repair the damage where they could, using funds for transit--even bike and pedestrian paths--instead of more road building. Under the flexibility granted to them under ISTEA I, States transferred $3.6 billion from highways to transit, spurring improvements in transit systems all across the country. 
This bill will continue a strong investment in transit, and improve and expand transit commuting benefits for employees. Mass transit is vital to the economic health of our cities, which remain the primary generators of wealth in the United States. Mass transit enables our cities to thrive by retaining their physical density, richness, and character. Without mass transit, urban life and culture disperse and eventually disappear, leaving all Americans poorer indeed.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in support of the Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998. This important legislation addresses the perils of environmental degradation and, to a limited extent, the pressures of third world debt. 
As some of the other co-sponsors of this legislation have noted, tropical forests around the globe are disappearing at an alarming rate. Economic pressures are nearly always the underlying cause. Rural populations constrained by poverty engage in destructive short-term exploitation of timber. Growing populations result in growing land use pressures, often causing large tracts of forested land to be clear cut and converted to agricultural uses. Yet in most cases, there are opportunities to redirect development toward a sustainable course. 
The legislation we are introducing today responds to some of these opportunities, by establishing a new program for debt-for-nature swaps between the United States and the tropical developing countries of Africa and Asia. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 builds upon the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) first established under the Bush Administration. The EAI created a system by which Latin American and Caribbean governments could restructure some of their official debt to the United States, on the condition that funds be established in local currency to support environmental conservation. 
The idea of linking debt to conservation, often referred to as `debt-for-nature swaps,' was first articulated in 1984 by Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, then a vice president of the World Wildlife Fund. In early 1986, Costa Rica announced the first transaction based on this premise. The Costa Rican plan involved a debt-for-equity swap in which the Northeast Bank of Minnesota was allowed to exchange $10 million in Costa Rican debt titles for an equity position in Portico, a local door manufacturing industry with considerable export potential. Local currency bonds provided by the central bank of Costa Rica were used to purchase nearly 5,000 hectares of forest, which was held in trust by the government to ensure sustainable forest management practices. 
Since the 1986 Costa Rica transaction, the idea of converting commercial debt into local currency instruments for conservation projects has gained momentum, and more than a dozen countries in Latin America have approved similar projects. Costa Rica has gone on to negotiate other debt-for-nature swaps with the governments of Sweden and the Netherlands. The success of these projects in Costa Rica, and elsewhere in Latin America, make them models for potential projects elsewhere on the globe. 
The Tropical Forest Conservation Act is designed to spur new debt-for-nature exchanges in areas outside of Latin America--namely, in the tropics of Asia and Africa. The new conservation projects which are established as a result of this legislation will benefit from the lessons learned through the earlier Latin American projects. Two important lessons are illustrated by the Costa Rican experience. 
First, experience has taught us the importance of the local organization administering the conservation program. Non-governmental organizations sometimes lack the technical and administrative expertise necessary for effective management of a large conservation effort. In Costa Rica, the debt-for-nature program has been carried out through the National Park Foundation. The respectability of this foundation, and its commitment to environmental education, ecological tourism and scientific research largely contributed to its successful administration of the conservation projects in its charge. We must ensure that the organizations administering the conservation efforts established through this legislation have the requisite knowledge and technical expertise to manage their charges effectively. 
Second, a cautionary note is in order regarding limitations on the magnitude of these projects. Ultimately, debt-for-nature exchanges imply that the local government must print local currency bonds, and eventually these will increase a country's money supply--thus creating inflationary pressures. At the request of the Costa Rican government, the Nature Conservancy commissioned a study to assess the potential inflationary impact of debt-for-nature swaps. This study concluded that if Costa Rica were to spend $50 million in local currency generated by debt-for-nature exchanges each year, the inflationary impact would be less than 0.5 percent. Although this figure may appear negligible, inflationary pressures may become significant if a large fraction of a nation's debt is involved in a debt-for-nature exchange. 
By incorporating the lessons we have learned through earlier debt-for-nature projects in Latin America, I am confident that we will ensure the success of such exchanges in tropical developing countries of Asia and Africa. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this important legislation, which will help third world nations to develop in a sustainable, environmentally-minded fashion. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to lend their support to this effort.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, January 4 of this year marked the eightieth birthday of a constituent, Robert B. Sloane. This Friday, March 13, Bob Sloane's friends and family will gather to celebrate his entry into his ninth decade. Having recently earned the title of septuagenarian, I wish him hearty congratulations on this senescent achievement. 
Bob Sloane was born in Brooklyn, NY and has always been a resident of our fair state. He was graduated from New York University's School of Dentistry at the age of 21 and spent the next two years living on Roosevelt Island as a resident. 
And then began World War II. Bob Sloane entered what was then the United States Army Air Force serving for four years both at home and in the South Pacific. While stationed on the island of Guam, he received orders to construct a fence around the periphery of the camp. In charge of a number of young men he instructed them to build the fence in the hard, coral ground of the island. The fence was a disaster, toppled by a tap from his commanding officer. And down came the single line order signed by the commanding general: Captain Robert B. Sloane is hereby immediately relieved of his duty as utility officer for this command. Bob Sloane's skills were clearly that of an oral surgeon and not a constructor of embattlements. 
He left the U.S. Army Air Force in 1945 having attained the rank of captain and returned to civilian life. He spent the next four decades ministering to the oral health of the residents of the state of New York and raising his four children. 
Bob Sloane is now well into his second career as a painter. He has been the subject of a number of shows and wields his brush at classes at the National Academy of Design, School of Fine Art as well at his studios in New York City and Warwick, NY. 
I would like to take this opportunity, Mr. President, to join with Bob Sloane's family and friends in wishing him a very happy eightieth birthday.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to congratulate the Senator from Kansas on this amendment, which I hope will be accepted. I can attest that in my own State of New York this kind of difficulty has arisen. I think the amendment will have an important effect in bringing about agreed solutions as against agitated--how do I say--contested solutions. 
So I thank the Senator. If I could, I ask that I be added as a cosponsor, and yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. There are just some days you have nothing but luck around here. Might I just thank the managers for having agreed to the amendment. I am sure Senator Specter would want to be associated with this. I make the point for the record that in our present legislation, the Secretary of Transportation is directed to choose one maglev project to proceed. 
Senator Specter and I feel that there is no reason we should not have more than one, if that makes sense. If there are alternative engineering techniques that should be tested, the Secretary agrees more than one is the way to proceed in an experimental mode. 
I note, sir, that magnetic levitation was invented on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge in February of 1960. A nuclear engineer by the name of Powell, working at Brookhaven, was on his way back to MIT from a visit, and between the time the car slowed down in that `permanent' traffic jam and the time he paid his toll, he thought up maglev. 
The Germans are now in the process of building a route from Hamburg to Berlin, which will be open in 2005 and make the trip in 55, 58 minutes. The Japanese have much the same technology. We have nothing. In ISTEA I we authorized $1 billion for this newest mode of transportation since the airplane. It is an extraordinary phenomenon. It travels easily at 270 miles an hour, will go to 350--no friction, no exhaust. We invented it; the Germans and the Japanese are building it. 
In the 6 years of ISTEA, with the $1 billion authorized, no Secretary of Transportation took any effort, any energy, any initiative. That is a formula for failure, failure in Government. We hope that this will not continue. We have authorized an equal amount in this bill, but we had better pull up our socks here or we are going to find ourselves with the most important transportation technology of the next century manufactured elsewhere--important here. 
I just add, because the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia is on the floor, that this type of transportation is uniquely suited for the generation of electricity and powerplants that is then distributed along the system. It does not have to--you do not have your powerplant within the train or within the car or within the plane. It is simply electricity moving along magnets--elemental. Simple as a thing can be, a great American invention so far ignored by our Department of Transportation, which I am sorry to say is still in the four-lane highway mode and does not seem to be able to get out of it. 
But that is a personal view. I do not want to associate it with Senator Specter--just mine. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the managers of the bill. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I rise in the spirit of the chairman's wish and the Senate's clear interest that we move ahead and get this work done. It is almost finished. 
This is an absolutely indispensable title. It provides the money for the programs that have been authorized so far. 
I will make two points. One is that the amendment was reported out of the Committee on Finance unanimously. Once again, the chairman has brought us to a bipartisan unanimous position, and I personally thank him for accepting the provision that gives equal treatment to mass transit commuters, as well as those who receive parking benefits from their employers. 
This is an excellent measure, Mr. President. It is not without certain serendipity that the managers of the underlying bill, the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Montana, are also members of the Finance Committee. 
So we are here in perfect accord, and I hope we can proceed directly to approving this amendment, although I understand we have an agreement that an amendment will be offered shortly by the Senator from Florida. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to call our attention to a most significant event to be held next week. On March 10, 1998, New York University will honor the generosity and vision of Henry Hart Rice with the first ever Henry Hart Rice Urban Policy Forum on `The Revitalization of New York City.' 
The moderator will be Dr. Mitchell L. Moss who has fittingly been named the Henry Hart Rice Professor of Urban Policy and Planning, a newly endowed chair at New York University. In addition to honoring the remarkable legacy and vision of Mr. Rice, this new chair, according to University President, L. Jay Oliva, `will play a major role in supporting undergraduate programs in urban policy that will be available to students from all schools of the University.' 
The study of urban policy is vital to the future of New York and our nation. Appropriate that it is carried out by as vital and lively an institution as NYU. But let us not lose sight of our history as we look forward. For the longest while we in New York defined ourselves by spectacular public works. The Croton Aqueduct, 1842--pick and shovel all the way for 41 miles to 42nd Street. We built Central Park in two years--more gunpowder than was used at Gettysburg. The Empire State Building --a public work really--14 months. Steam power. But the plain fact is that we have developed a civic culture in which prestige more often goes to those who prevent the city from developing than to those who enable it. The time has come to ask how this came about, and how it might be reversed. 
Thus, it is with great anticipation that we look to Professor Moss, the esteemed participants in the Henry Hart Rice Urban Policy Forum, and the committed leaders at NYU, to lead us toward this end.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the two leaders for their support and welcome them to an effort that began in the 103rd Congress with the adoption of P.L. 103-236, establishing the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. This bi-partisan commission, which I had the privilege of chairing, and on which Senator Helms played an important role, issued its unanimous report last March. The Commission found that the current system neither protects nor releases national security information particularly well.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. The central fact is that we live today in an information age. Open sources give us the vast majority of what we need to know in order to make intelligent decisions. Analysis, far more than secrecy, is the key to security. Decisions made by people at ease with disagreement and ambiguity and tentativeness. Decisions made by those who understand how to exploit the wealth and diversity of publicly available information, who no longer simply assume that clandestine collection, i.e. `stealing secrets', equates with greater intelligence. 
We are not going to put an end to secrecy. It is at times legitimate and necessary. But a culture of secrecy need not remain the norm in American government as regards national security. It is possible to conceive that a competing culture of openness might develop which could assert and demonstrate greater efficiency.

One of the important recommendations of the Commission was a proposal for a statute establishing a general classification regime and creating a national declassification center.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Last year the number of officials with the authority to classify documents originally decreased by 959 to 4,420. Presumably, this should reduce the number of classifications, but the number of classifications increased by nearly two-thirds, over 5.7 million. There cannot be 5.7 million secrets a year which, if revealed, would cause `damage' to the national security. To paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart's decision regarding the Pentagon Papers, when everything is secret, nothing is secret.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. If the Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy is to serve any large purpose, it is to introduce the public to the thought that secrecy is a mode of regulation. In truth, it is the ultimate mode, for the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated. Normal regulation concerns how citizens must behave, and so regulations are widely promulgated. Secrecy, by contrast, concerns what citizens may know. The citizen is not told what may not be known. 
With the arrival of the New Deal agencies in the 1930s, it became clear that public regulation needed to be made more accessible to the public. In 1935, for example, the Federal Register began publication. Thereafter all public regulations were published and accessible. In 1946, the Administrative Procedure Act established procedures by which the citizen can question and even litigate regulation. In 1966, the Freedom of Information Act, technically an amendment to the original 1946 Act, provided citizens yet more access to government files. 
The Administrative Procedure Act brought some order and accountability to the flood of government regulations that at time bids fare to overwhelm us. Even so, `over-regulation' is a continuing theme in American life, as in most modern administrative states. Secrecy would be such an issue, save that secrecy is secret. Make no mistake, however. It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it malfunctions.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is correct--there has been only one other statutory inquiry into this subject. This was the Commission on Government Security, established in 1955 by the 84th Congress, known as the Wright Commission for its Chairman, Lloyd Wright, past President of the American Bar Association. This was a distinguished bipartisan body, which included in its membership Senators John C. Stennis of Mississippi and Norris Cotton of New Hampshire, along with Representatives William M. McCulloch of Ohio and Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania. 
The Commission report, issued 40 years ago, is a document of careful balance and great detail. The Commission was concerned with classification as a cost. Free inquiry, like free markets, is the most efficient way to get good results. The Commission set forth a great many proposals ranging from Atomic Energy to Passport Security, but its legislative proposals were concise: the proposal to outlaw by statute `disclosures of classified information. . . by persons outside as well as within the Government' was quickly perceived as prior restraint: press censorship. The response was swift and predictable. The recommendation was criticized strongly in articles and editorials in a variety of newspapers, notably by James Reston. And the Commission's recommendations were dropped.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Government Secrecy Act will provide a framework for our secrecy system which can limit the number of documents initially classified and significantly reduce the backlog of already classified documents. It sets standards for declassification whereby information may not remain classified for longer than 10 years unless the head of the agency which created the information certifies to the President that the information requires continued protection. Information not declassified within 10 years may not remain classified for more than 30 years without another certification. It requires that a balancing test be established in making classification and declassification decisions so that officials must weigh the benefit from public disclosure of information against the need for initial or continued protection of the information under the classification system. 
The bill also establishes a national declassification center to coordinate and oversee the declassification policies and practices of the Federal Government to ensure that declassification is efficient, cost-effective, and consistent. 
I thank the Majority Leader for raising his concerns. It is my sincere intention to work with the Majority Leader and other interested Senators to perfect this legislation, so that we might pass it in the coming months.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to name the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) headquarters here in Washington after Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to three Presidents, director of the NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary. I am pleased that Senators Kerry and Moseley-Braun are co-sponsors of my bill. I would point out that Senator Kerry was poised to introduce similar legislation; in fact, he sent out a Dear Colleague on the subject last November. But he graciously deferred to me, and I am most appreciative. Bob Weaver was my friend, dating back more than 40 years to our service together in the Harriman administration. He passed away last July at his home in New York City after spending his entire life broadening opportunities for minorities in America. I think it is a fitting tribute to name the HUD building after this great man. 
Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's `Black Cabinet,' an informal advisory group promoting educational and job opportunities for blacks. The Washington Post called this work his greatest legacy, the dismantling of a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America. Indeed it was. 
Dr. Weaver was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Housing for New York State in 1955, and later became State Rent Administrator with Cabinet rank. It was during these years working for New York Governor Averell Harriman that I first met Bob; I was Assistant to the Secretary to the Governor and later, Acting Secretary. 
Our friendship and collaboration continued under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. In 1960, he became the president of the NAACP, and shortly thereafter would become a key adviser to President Kennedy on civil rights. In 1961, Kennedy appointed Dr. Weaver to head the Housing and Home Finance Agency, an entity that later became the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, when President Johnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, Dr. Weaver was, in Johnson's phrase, `the man for the job.' He thus became its first Secretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet agency. Later, he and I served together on the Pennsylvania Avenue Commission. 
Following his government service, Dr. Weaver was, among various other academic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, a visiting professor at Columbia Teacher's College and New York University's School of Education, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. When I became director of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at MIT and Harvard, he generously agreed to be a member of the Board of Directors. 
Dr. Weaver had earned his undergraduate, master's, and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard; he wrote four books on urban affairs; and he was one of the original directors of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which designed the plan to rescue New York City during its tumultuous financial crisis in the 1970s. 
Last July, America--and Washington in particular (for he was a native Washingtonian)--lost one of its innovators, one of its creators, one of its true leaders. For Dr. Robert Weaver led not only with his words but with his deeds. I was privileged to know him as a friend. He will be missed but properly memorialized, I think, if we can pass this legislation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in this morning's New York Times, Thomas L. Friedman has written a powerful critique of what he calls `fumbling on NATO expansion.' In it he refers to a letter in the spring issue of The National Interest from George F. Kennan who warns that NATO expansion is an historic blunder. Ambassador Kennan's letter came in response to an article by Owen Harries, editor of The National Interest, on `The Dangers of Expansive Realism' in the current, winter issue of The National Interest. 
It is surely a rare moment when three respected commentators on foreign affairs, and in Ambassador Kennan's case, a participant of historic standing, each of quite distinctive points of view, come together in such strong agreement. In an article in The New York Times of February 5th, 1997, Ambassador Kennan stated that `expanding NATO would be the most fateful error of American policy in the entire post-cold-war era.'

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported the Resolution of Ratification to NATO enlargement. It is appropriate at this time to inform my colleagues of my intention to offer a condition to the Resolution of Ratification when it comes to the Senate for debate linking NATO expansion with economic expansion. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner. 
The former Majority Leader, Howard Baker, Jr., our colleague Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft, and Alton Frye recently wrote an article for The New York Times in which they assert that `Linking NATO expansion to the expansion of the European Union would underscore the connection between Europe's security and its economy--and offer certification that entrants to NATO could afford to meet its defense obligations.' 
It is our contention that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic face no security threats, so strengthening their economies and democratic institutions should be their first priority. 
All three of the candidates are eager to join the European Union (EU), which has now decided to begin accession negotiations with them. NATO's decision at Madrid to invite these countries to negotiate for membership preceded the EU offer to negotiate accession. The EU's offer affords the Senate an opportunity to lend support to these countries' bid for EU membership, without accepting any presumption that entry into the EU guarantees admission to NATO. 
A provision to link admission to NATO with admission to the EU will encourage expeditious negotiations by the EU, and will allow the three countries to concentrate their full resources on economic modernization, rather than diverting precious resources to military expenditures.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution seeking to right a 50 year wrong. I am joined by the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, and 37 of my colleagues. Having served as our Ambassador to the United Nations, I am painfully aware of the paradox facing Israel at the United Nations. Israel is a state which was created by the United Nations, and yet for 50 years has been treated as a step-child--or worse--in its dealings at the United Nations. 
Never was that more apparent than the sad period when the General Assembly equated Zionism with racism. It took a long 16 years to repeal, but after great effort it was done. Today, I hope we can begin a similar effort to end a Cold War anomaly. I speak of the fact that Israel is excluded from a United Nations regional group. Israel is the only one of the 185 member states of the United Nations barred from membership in a regional group. The United Nations member states have organized themselves by regional groups since before Israel joined the United Nations in 1949. Membership in a United Nations regional group confers eligibility to sit on the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, as well as other United Nations councils, commissions, and committees. 
This effort could mirror that of the effort to repeal the odious General Assembly Resolution 3379, equating Zionism with racism. That effort was led by Chaim Herzog. He came to Washington in 1987 for the first state visit by a President of Israel to the United States in history. 
I took the floor of the Senate to introduce a Joint Resolution following word-for-word an Australian measure calling for the repeal of Resolution 3379. 
The Senate and the House of Representatives adopted the resolution unanimously, in time for Chaim Herzog to address a Joint Meeting of Congress on November 10, 1987--on the 12th anniversary of his defense of Israel at the United Nations in opposition to Resolution 3379. President Reagan signed the resolution on November 17. Finally, there was an American policy. We meant to repeal General Assembly Resolution 3379. 
Both the Zionism resolution and the rejectionist Arab Front would soon lose their major support with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The General Assembly overwhelmingly repealed Resolution 3379 on December 16, 1991. The fight had taken 16 years. 
We won that battle but one cold war anachronism remains at the United Nations. One sorry throwback to an era when the institutionalized isolation of Israel was a given in international affairs--the ugly `gentlemen's agreement' that excludes Israel and only Israel from membership in any United Nations Regional Group. Israel--and only Israel--can never sit on the United Nations Security Council. Israel--and only Israel--can never serve on the United Nations Economic and Social Council, where her expertise is so sorely missed. Israel--and only Israel--is less than a full member of the very international organization which bravely voted on November 29, 1947, to create the State of Israel. 
A hundred years ago the Zionist Congress first articulated the Zionist dream. 
Fifty years ago the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the Zionist dream. 
Today, we call for Israel's admission to a United Nations Regional Group. This must be a goal of our government's foreign policy and a priority of reform efforts at the United Nations. That such legislation is necessary is a reminder that, despite the unparalleled success of the Zionist movement in its first hundred years, the state created half a century ago as the fruit of this ideal still requires support from its friends. 
I can think of no more fitting congressional tribute to this vision than our country taking its rightful place in the forefront of the effort to allow Israel to participate fully in international affairs, to be counted as a legitimate member among the nations of the world. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for supporting the measure. In particular I thank Senator Lugar for his strong support in this effort. I hope that this will begin an effort which will finally bring Israel completely within the fold of the United Nations.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 1848 was one of the busiest years of the 19th Century in Europe. Everywhere kings were abdicating, ministers fleeing, mobs roving. In London, Karl Marx and Frederich Engels composed a pamphlet entitled Manifesto of the Communist Party. Revolution was all the rage. But the real revolution was taking place in a small brick chapel in a village in upstate New York where people had begun to think of a revolution unlike anything known--equal rights for women. 
The American movement for women's rights began in Waterloo, New York nearly 150 years ago when five women met at the home of Jane and Richard Hunt. There, Elizabeth Cady Stanton of Seneca Falls, Mary Ann McClintock of Waterloo, Marta Coffin Wright of nearby Auburn, Lucretia Coffin Mott of Philadelphia and Mrs. Hunt planned the first women's rights convention held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls. It was also there that they wrote the `Declaration of Sentiments,' a document which can certainly be regarded as the Magna Carta of the women's movement. Modeled on our Declaration of Independence, the `Declaration of Sentiments' proclaimed that: 
All men and women are created equal: That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
This unprecedented declaration called for broad societal changes aimed at eliminating discriminatory restrictions on women in all their spheres of life. A woman's right to a higher education, the right to own property and the right to retain her own wages--all these and more were proclaimed in this landmark document endorsed at the Seneca Falls Convention on July 19 and 20, 1848. 
Perhaps most importantly, the convention was the catalyst for the 19th Amendment. There, Elizabeth Cady Stanton made what was at the time a most radical proposal. She called for extending the franchise to women. 
Ameila Bloomer, publisher of Lily, the first prominent women's rights newsletter, eloquently defended Stanton's call and articulated the importance of the vote:  
In this country there is one great tribunal by which all theories must be tried, all principles tested, all measures settled: and that tribunal is the ballot box. It is the medium through which public opinion finally makes itself heard. Deny to any class in the community the right to be heard at the ballot-box and that class sinks at once into a state of slavish dependence, of civil insignificance, which nothing can save from becoming subjugation, oppression and wrong. 
It was fully 72 years before the Nation heeded their call for the vote for women. 
It took but 10 months in 1980, however, to establish a Women's Rights Historic Park at Seneca Falls and Waterloo, commemorating this call. Then-Senator Javits and I proposed a bill that created an historic park within Seneca Falls to commemorate the early beginnings of the women's movement and to recognize the important role Seneca Falls has played in the movement. The park consists of five sites: the 1840's Greek Revival home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organizer and leader of the women's rights movement; the Wesleyan Chapel, where the First Women's Rights Convention was held; Declaration Park with a 100 foot waterwall engraved with the Declaration of Sentiments and the names of the signers of Declaration; and the M'Clintock house, home of MaryAnn and Thomas M'Clintock, where the Declaration was drafted. 
On June 27 last, my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato and I introduced S. Con. Res. 35, a resolution that urges the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Convention. It is only fitting that a stamp be issued commemorating this historic anniversary and highlighting the importance of continuing this struggle for equal rights and opportunity for women in areas such as health care, education, employment, and pay equity. 
Today Senator D'Amato and I, in concert with Representative Louise M. Slaughter of Rochester, introduce legislation which would direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the development of a Women's Rights Historic Trail stretching from Boston, Massachusetts to Buffalo, New York. 
Mr. President, the contributions made by women in that region are many. This is hallowed ground that needs to be celebrated. It would include such sites as the Susan B. Anthony House and voting place in Rochester; the Women's Rights National Historical Park; the National Women's Hall of Fame and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca Falls; the Harriet Tubman House and memorial in Auburn; and the Eleanor Roosevelt home in Hyde Park. 
The women of Seneca Falls challenged America to social revolution with a list of demands that touched upon every aspect of life. Testing different approaches, the early women's rights leaders came to view the ballot as the best way to challenge the system, but they did not limit their efforts to this one issue. Fifty years after the convention, women could claim property rights, employment and educational opportunities, divorce and child custody laws, and increased social freedoms. By the early 20th century, a coalition of suffragists, temperance groups, reform-minded politicians, and women's social welfare organizations mustered a successful push for the vote. 
Today Congress honors Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along with Susan B. Anthony, as revolutionary leaders of the women's movement by placing a statue of them in the Capitol Rotunda next to statues of other leaders in our Nation's history such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr. 
An historic trail would be a living monument to women's history, bringing to life the numerous pioneers so often left out of our textbooks. In `The Ladies of Seneca Falls: The Birth of the Women's Rights Movement', Miriam Gurko writes: 
Most histories contain, if anything, only the briefest allusion to the woman's rights movement in the nineteenth century--perhaps no more than a sentence to include it in the general upsurge of reform. Here and there the name of a woman's rights leader might be mentioned, generally that of Susan B. Anthony, sometimes Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The rest might never have existed so far as the general run of historical sources is concerned. 
One of the most important social forces of our time is women's struggle to achieve equality, and, as such, it is incumbent upon us to pay tribute to its many heroes.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the revered journalist Harry Ashmore died last month at the age of 81. He died one day after the day set aside to observe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and our nation's bitter struggle for civil rights. Mr. Ashmore was a leader in the struggle to integrate schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. His writings helped deliver Americans peacefully from unjust and oppressive laws. 
A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Mr. Ashmore was raised to revere Southern traditions. His grandfathers fought for the Confederacy. As a young man, he was graduated from Clemson Agricultural College and then worked as a reporter in Greenville and in Charlotte, North Carolina. He served during the Second World War as an infantry battalion commander in the European theater and completed his military service a Lieutenant Colonel. After the war, he returned to North Carolina and to The Charlotte News, where he rose to the position of editor. In 1948, he moved to Little Rock and began his eleven years at The Arkansas Gazette. There, he would become The Gazette's executive editor. 
Harry Ashmore loved the South. He embodied the dignity of a southern gentlemen throughout his years. But he was never provincial--either in his writing or his thinking. He studied at Harvard University as a Nieman fellow; from 1960 to 1963, he was editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia Britannica and from 1969 to 1974, he was president of the Center for the Study of Democracy in Santa Barbara, California. In addition, he found time to author, co-author and/or edit a dozen books. In 1996, he was honored with the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Lifetime Achievement Award. 
But it was in newspapers where he would have his greatest influence on American life. In 1957, three years after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown, Arkansas' Governor Orval E. Faubus called out the National Guard because of `evidence of disorder and threats of disorder.' As ever, Harry Ashmore called it like he saw it. He described the eerie scene as, `the incredible spectacle of an empty high school surrounded by the National Guard, troops called out by Governor Faubus to protect life and property against a mob that never materialized.' 
Ashmore knew Governor Faubus wanted to prevent nine students from entering Little Rock High School. He warned against delay, realizing that resisting the Supreme Court would bring bloodshed. In The Gazette, he argued dispassionately for the people of Arkansas to uphold the law. He wrote: `There is no valid reason to assume that delay will resolve the impasse which Mr. Faubus has made. We doubt that Mr. Faubus can simply wear the Federals out--although he is doing a pretty good job of wearing out his own people.' Harry Ashmore understood before so many others the power and the moral force of civil liberty. And yet, he also knew the rooted strength of the opposition. 
Above all he was honest, to himself and to his readers. Through his calm and reasoned editorials he stood for justice despite daily threats on his life and on his family. The Gazette suffered financially for his courage. It lost advertising revenue and circulation. Harry Ashmore, however, fought for his beliefs, and he helped lead Arkansas and the Nation toward equality for all its citizens. In 1958, the Pulitzer committee recognized Harry's excellence in editorial writing by awarding him the Pulitzer Prize for `clearness of style, moral purpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion.' In addition to his own Pulitzer, in 1958, The Gazette was awarded the Pulitzer for public service. 
Harry Ashmore was on the front lines of the struggle for civil rights in this country. His leadership, courage, and wise words must not be forgotten.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, next Wednesday, February 18, marks an auspicious occasion: Michael B. Robertson--a constituent--will turn 50. He will become a quinquagenarian. Individuals often approach this milestone with some trepidation. That need not be, for as Sir Richard Steele wrote, `Age in a virtuous person, of either sex, carries in it an authority which makes it preferable to all the pleasures of youth.' Now, Steele was all of 38 or 39 when he wrote that in 1711, but I can attest to the sentiment, having become a septuagenarian last March. More important, we learn from Leviticus 25:10 that `Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you.' 
Michael Robertson was born in Scotland in 1948. But he `left fair Scotland's strand' at the age of six and moved with his family to the United States. He obtained a bachelor of arts degree in English from Wilkes University in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania in 1969. From there, as a young man, he headed west, following the advice of Horace Greeley (actually, it was the advice of John Babsone Lane Soule, in an article published in the Terre Haute Express in 1851). 
His car and his funds made it to Los Angeles. He had to find work, and ended up taking a job in the mailroom of Carson/Roberts Advertising. His superiors quickly recognized his innate ability and work ethic, and promoted him to copywriter. Soon thereafter, he was an associate creative director with Young & Rubicam, eventually returning to the East Coast. Onward and upward in the highly competitive business of advertising to his present position as executive creative director of Bates USA, where he is responsible for the overall creative product of a $1.1 billion agency. 
Mr. Robertson, I might note, is a neighbor of sorts. His office is in the venerable Chrysler Building, a few floors below the suite which is my New York City office. He has a lovely family, including a daughter, Megan (just recently married); a son, Brendan (a strapping young man presently in college); and another daughter, Charlotte (a star fourth-grader at the Nightingale-Bamford School). His wife, Linda, is quite accomplished in her own right: she produced the television commercials commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. 
I would like to take this opportunity, Mr. President, to join with Michael Robertson's family and friends too numerous to count in wishing him a very happy fiftieth birthday. May it truly be a jubilee.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is an honor to speak following the statement by our revered, sometime President pro tempore, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a man who has brought to our Chamber a sensibility concerning the Constitution that, I would argue, is unequaled since those awful days that led to the Civil War, days in which his lucidity and courage could have produced a very different outcome. 
We have a matter before us of equal consequence. I would offer the personal judgment that in the history of the Constitution, there has never come before us an issue considering the relations between the executive and the legislative branches as important as this one. It is a course of a peculiar inexplicability that this Chamber is empty--the distinguished Presiding Officer from Utah, our President pro tempore sometime from West Virginia and myself--empty because of a particular politics that for a long time said this was a desirable measure and enacted it and now faces the court saying, `But it's unconstitutional.' 
The courts, I dare to say, at the level of those asides that are well known in our judicial history, the court is also saying, `Don't you know your Constitution? Don't you understand what is at stake for you?' The courts are not themselves directly involved here, but they are trying to tell us, in brilliant decisions by Judge Jackson, now by Judge Hogan, singularly literate decisions. 
Judge Hogan begins his historical analysis, if you will, with a citation from Gibbon's `Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire':  
The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost when the legislative power is nominated by the executive. 
That is how he saw the decline of the Roman Senate, inexorably followed by the decline of Roman civilization. That is what we are dealing with here today. 
As Senator Byrd has so forcefully stated, George Washington, whose birthday we observe on Monday, who presided over the Constitutional Convention, in his later writings put it as explicitly as only he could do with that clarity and simplicity he had. Washington said: 
From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all the parts of a Bill or reject it in toto. 
That could not be more plain. And we find the courts saying to us--I don't presume to say this is obiter dicta, but I can see the courts pleading: `Senators, do you not know what is at stake?' 
As for the claims of efficiency and economy and this and that--legitimate claims--but the court refers in this particular decision, Judge Hogan refers to a wonderful passage from Chadha, which was so true about the original understandings of the political and Government process of the founders. He said in the Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, a decision in 1983--as I recall, it is on the one-House veto--the court said: 
The fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient and useful in facilitating functions of government standing alone will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution. Convenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives or the hallmarks of democratic government. 
That was the great perception of our founders. In the Federalist Papers, which Senator Byrd has so generously mentioned, they ask openly, given the fugitive and turbulent existence of earlier republics, the Roman Republic, what makes you think this Republic will work? 
They said, fair question, but we have a new science of politics. It is a science that does not assume virtue in men, it assumes conflict, and it provides for the resolution of conflict by equal and opposing forces. It does not fear debate. It welcomes it, it assumes self-interest on the part of regions, of sectors in the economy, of groups in the population. No fear. 
And here is a central idea which was part of our amicus brief and which we find, I think, echoed in Judge Hogan's remarks, which I don't assert but I offer the thought. When we put together on the Senate floor a bill--I will say a Finance Committee bill, as I am now ranking member, was one time chairman of Finance--we think of balancing interests, conflicting or often unrelated, but there are 100 Members of this Chamber. They represent 50 States and 550 different points of view. We accommodate them. We provide for this interest and for that interest and hope and, I think, in the main see that the public interest is served by the opportunities of governing. 
If you were to take one of those provisions out or two or three, it would be quite possible you would not have the votes to pass the bill. There could be a filibuster, or there simply could not be the 51 votes. 
However, with the line-item veto, the President can subsequently take out such provisions such that the statute books will contain a law which never could have passed the U.S. Congress. 
 How say we, the statute books will have a law that could not have passed the Congress? Here it is, this is the arrangement. The courts are so clear on this, and I so look forward to a final decision by the Supreme Court. 
It is interesting, if I may say, just to give an illustration of the compound interests of people involved, on the one hand we have two plaintiffs here, the City of New York, et al. The City of New York being the Greater New York Hospital Association, those great hospitals and the union of hospital employees which work there. The city, great science centers, ordinary persons who clean floors and care for patients. 
They are one group. 
Across the continent, another group, the Snake River Potato Growers, Incorporated--about 30 farmers. They grow potatoes. They have an interest. It was in a bill, and it was taken out. That interest, I think, would have had real effect on the decision how to vote of the two Senators in this Chamber who represent those potato growers. 
So you have radiologists and potato growers and people who scrub floors and people who go beyond the limits of conceivable knowledge in the biological and medical sciences. All these interests are always represented here, and only here. 
Congress makes the laws. The President is required to see that they are faithfully executed. But, sir, and in closing, if nothing else will bring this Chamber to its wits, perhaps this will. The President's power under this line-item veto is likely rarely to be directly exercised. It will be threatened.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I add, not only honest but a courageous man. In some 21 years on the Senate floor I have not heard a more refreshing and inspiriting statement. It is not surprising coming from the Senator from Utah, but it is all the more amazing. There are few places in this world today where such a statement could be made and praised. 
It is a tribute to you, sir; also a tribute to the U.S. Army, I believe. But we will not get into that. I thank you for your remarks, sir.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Isidore Schwartz, a Polish immigrant to the United States and World War II veteran who is reported to have been the first man to repair mechanical watches in combat during his four years of dedicated service to the United States Army. 
Mr. Schwartz learned the trade of watch repair through a Work Progress Administration program during the Depression, a skill which he later used to assist the United States military. Upon induction into the army, Isidore Schwartz, wishing to use all of his talents to help the war effort, brought the necessary instruments for repairing mechanical watches. Originally, he merely intended to perform favors for the men with whom he served. His ability to repair military mechanical watches in combat developed into a skill recognized and sought after by the Army. 
Mr. Schwartz's talent was discovered during an inspection tour of an infantry company. The Commanding Officer of the Company asked Mr. Schwartz's Commanding Officer if he had a watchmaker. The Commanding Officer called Mr. Schwartz over and presented him with several malfunctioning military watches. Working out of a modified bus, Isidore Schwartz successfully repaired the watches. Word spread to the War Department that Private Schwartz had the ability to perform the important function of military watch repair in combat. Had it not been for Mr. Schwartz's initiative during his service, these military watches would have been shipped for repair under hazardous war time conditions. 
Isidore Schwartz's contribution to the war effort was not limited to the repair of mechanical watches in combat as he used his ingenuity to perform similar important tasks. One accomplishment was the repair of a lieutenant's eyeglasses which were severely bent out of shape. In the process of straightening the frame, hinges broke on both sides making the glasses unwearable. Despite lacking the necessary parts to perform the repair, Mr. Schwartz, using a small brass rod and a jeweler's file created the necessary hinges thus successfully completing the repair. It is this creativity and dedication to helping fellow soldiers and the United States Army which makes the actions of Private Schwartz deserving of recognition and commendation. 
Through our recognition of Mr. Schwartz's achievements, we are reminded of the tremendous contribution immigrants have made in the shaping of our nation. This diverse group of extraordinary, enterprising, and self-sufficient individuals have continuously served to strengthen the United States. The great desire of America's immigrants to contribute combined with a passion to improve their new home has allowed the United States to assume the position of world leader. We are forever grateful for their strength and courage. 
The quiet, yet significant actions of Isidore Schwartz during his four years of military service in Northern Ireland and North Africa exemplify his commitment and dedication to the United States of America. It is with great pleasure that I join his many friends in the Bronx who will be honoring Mr. Schwartz this summer for being the first man to repair mechanical watches in combat.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. On September 28, 1996, the Senate passed the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, a 749-page bill with 24 separate titles. Included in that unwieldy legislation was the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, a far-reaching measure designed to curtail illegal immigration and prevent criminals from entering our country. This legislation, hurried to passage in the final days of a legislative session, has proven to be overly punitive in a number of cases, including that of Jesus Collado. 
On April 7, Jesus Collado, a 43-year-old legal resident of the United States, returned to this country after vacationing in the Dominican Republic, his homeland. Upon arrival at John F. Kennedy airport in New York, Mr. Collado was detained by INS officers who kept him handcuffed and made him sit on the floor of a room in the airport for nearly 24 hours. INS officials had determined Mr. Collado excludable because the Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act made the misdemeanor on his criminal record a deportable offense. Twenty-three years ago, when Mr. Collado was 19-years old, he was convicted of a class A misdemeanor, having sexual relations with a minor, his 15-year-old girlfriend. I should note here that their relationship was a consensual one. Mr. Collado was sentenced to a year's probation, which he served. He has not been in trouble with the law since. 
Whatever I or my colleagues think about his teenage indiscretion, the fact remains that he is not a serious criminal who should be excluded from entering the United States. Yet, as I mentioned, on April 7 last, Mr. Collado was arrested upon arrival in New York and was held without bail for 201 days at the INS Detention Facility at the York County Prison in York, Pennsylvania. 
The Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act was meant to keep serious criminals out of the United States. It was not meant to exclude those who have resided here legally for a quarter century because of a misdemeanor committed as a teenager. Might I add that Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Immigration Subcommittee seems to agree with me. In Anthony Lewis' December 22, 1997 column in the New York Times, Mr. Smith remarked that Jesus Collado's case `obviously tugs at your heart. Clearly this is an instance where humanitarian considerations should be taken into account. I believe in redemption and I believe it should be granted generously.' 
Ultimately, the Immigration and Naturalization Service must be given discretion in the implementation of this Act. But Mr. Collado and his family need relief now. Today I am introducing private relief legislation for Mr. Collado to establish that his misdemeanor is not grounds for inadmissibility, deportation or denial of citizenship. Representative Nydia Velazquez, who has worked tirelessly on Mr. Collado's behalf, has introduced a similar measure in the House of Representatives. I urge the Senate to act on this matter swiftly so that the Collado family may get on with their lives.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with good news. We have at long last seen a measure of justice in a case which brings back memories of an awful time in our nation's history. 
In 1953 Dr. Beatrice Braude, a linguist, was wrongfully dismissed from her position at the United States Information Agency and was subsequently blacklisted by the Federal government as a result of accusations of disloyalty to the United States. The accusations were old. Two years earlier the State Department's Loyalty Security Board had investigated and unanimously voted to dismiss them. The Board sent a letter to Dr. Braude stating `there is no reasonable doubt as to your loyalty to the United States Government or as to your security risk to the Department of State.' Despite this, her name was not cleared. 
Dr. Braude was terminated one day after being praised for her work and informed that she would probably be promoted. She was told that her termination was due to budgetary constraints, but the truth was that she was selected for termination because of the old--and answered--charges against her. Because she did not know the real reason for her dismissal, she was denied certain procedural rights, including the right to request a hearing. 
Over time she grew suspicious. When she was unable, over the course of several years, to secure employment anywhere else in the Federal government--even in a typing pool despite a perfect score on the typing test--she became convinced that she had been blacklisted. The Privacy Act of 1974 enabled her to obtain her government files and confirm her suspicions. She invested much time and energy fighting to regain Federal employment and restore her reputation. She was partially successful. In 1982, at the age of 69, she was hired as a language instructor in the CIA. Sadly, she still had not been able to clear her name by the time of her death in 1988. The irony of the charges against Dr. Braude is that she was an anti-communist, having witnessed first-hand Communist-sponsored terrorism in Europe while she was an assistant cultural affairs officer in Paris and, for a brief period, an exchange officer in Bonn during the late 1940's and early 1950's. 
Mr. President, I have reviewed the charges against Dr. Braude before on the floor of the Senate, but I think that they merit repeating because they are illustrative of that dark era and are instructive to us even today. There were a total of four charges. First, she was briefly a member of the Washington Book Shop on Farragut Square that the Attorney General later labeled subversive. Second, she had been in contact with Mary Jane Keeney, a Communist Party activist employed at the United Nations. Third, she had been a member of the State Department unit of the Communist-dominated Federal Workers' Union. Fourth, she was an acquaintance of Judith Coplon. 
With regard to the first charge, Dr. Braude had indeed joined the Book Shop shortly after her arrival in Washington in 1943. She was eager to meet congenial new people and a friend recommended the Book Shop, which hosted music recitals in the evenings. I must express some sensitivity here: my F.B.I. records report that I was observed several times at a `leftist musical review' in suburban Hampstead while I was attending the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Fellowship. 
Dr. Braude was aware of the undercurrent of sympathy with the Russian cause at the Book Shop, but her membership paralleled a time of close U.S.-Soviet collaboration. She drifted away from the Book Shop in 1944 because of her distaste for the internal politics of other active members. Her membership at the Book Shop was only discovered when her name appeared on 
a list of delinquent dues. It appears that her most sinister crime while a member of the book shop was her failure to return a book on time. 
Dr. Braude met Mary Jane Keeney on behalf of a third woman who actively aided Nazi victims after the war and was anxious to send clothing to another woman in occupied Germany. Dr. Braude knew nothing of Keeney's political orientation and characterized the meeting as a transitory experience. 
With regard to the third charge, Dr. Braude, in response to an interrogatory from the State Department's Loyalty Security Board, argued that she belonged to an anti-Communist faction of the State Department unit of the Federal Workers' Union. 
Remember that the Loyalty Security Board investigated these charges and exonerated her. 
The fourth charge, which Dr. Braude certainly did not--or could not--deny, was her friendship with Judith Coplon. Braude met Coplon in the summer of 1945 when both women attended a class Herbert Marcuse taught at American University. They saw each other infrequently thereafter. In May 1948, Coplon wrote to Braude, then stationed in Paris and living in a hotel on the Left Bank, to announce that she would be visiting shortly and needed a place to stay. Dr. Braude arranged for Coplon to stay at the hotel. Coplon stayed for 6 weeks, during which time Dr. Braude found her behavior very trying. The two parted on unfriendly terms. The friendship they had prior to parting was purely social. 
Mr. President, Judith Coplon was a spy. She worked in the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Division, an office integral to the FBI's counter-intelligence efforts. She was arrested early in 1949 while handing over notes on counterintelligence operations to Soviet citizen Valentine Gubitchev, a United Nations employee. Coplon was tried and convicted--there was no doubt of her guilt--but the conviction was overturned on a technicality. Gubitchev was also convicted but was allowed to return to the U.S.S.R. because of his quasi- diplomatic status. 
Judith Coplon was a spy. Beatrice Braude was not. We know that Judith Coplon was not alone as a Soviet spy; though there were not as many as one might have imagined given the American response. In 1956, Edward A. Shils captured the overreaction to Communist activities in the United States in his fine, small study, The Torment of Secrecy: The Background and Consequences of American Security Policy. `The American visage began to cloud over,' Shils wrote. `Secrets were to become our chief reliance just when it was becoming more and more evident that the Soviet Union had long maintained an active apparatus for espionage in the United States. For a country which had never previously thought of itself as an object of systematic espionage by foreign powers, it was unsettling.' 
The larger society, Shils continued, was `facing an unprecedented threat to its continuance.' In these circumstances, `The fantasies of apocalyptic visionaries * * * claimed the respectability of being a reasonable interpretation of the real situation.' A culture of secrecy took hold within American government, while a hugely divisive debate raged in the Congress and the press. 
The public now divided. There were those who perceived of treason on every hand, and so we witnessed the spectacle of Senator Joseph McCarthy making such accusations of George C. Marshall. Charges and counter-charges of Communist conspiracies proliferated. 
A balanced history of this period is now beginning to appear, but at the time, the American government and the American public was confronted with possibilities and charges, at once baffling and terrifying. A fault line appeared in American society that contributed to more than one political crisis in the years that followed. 
The first fact is that a significant Communist conspiracy was in place in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles, but in the main those involved systematically denied their involvement. This was the mode of Communist conspiracy the world over. 
The second fact is that many of those who came to prominence denouncing Communist conspiracy, accusing suspected Communists and `comsymps,' clearly knew little or nothing of such matters. And in many instances, just as clearly were not in the least concerned. And so while there were spies like Coplon who were caught, there were also innocent people who, having been accused, were unable to remove the stain. Dr. Braude is one such. 
My involvement in Dr. Braude's case dates back to early 1979, when she came to me and my colleague at the time, Senator Javits, and asked us to introduce private relief legislation on her behalf. In 1974, after filing a Freedom of Information Act request and finally learning the true reason for her dismissal, she filed suit in the Court of Claims to clear her name and seek reinstatement and monetary damages for the time she was prevented from working for the Federal government. The Court, however, dismissed her case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. On March 5, 1979, Senator Javits and I together introduced a bill, S. 546, to waive the statute of limitations on Dr. Braude's case against the U.S. government and to allow the Court of Claims to render judgment on her claim. The bill passed the Senate on January 30, 1980. Unfortunately, the House failed to take action on the bill before the 96th Congress adjourned. 
In 1988, and again in 1990, 1991, and 1993, Senator D'Amato and I re-introduced similar legislation on Dr. Braude's behalf. Our attempts met with repeated failure. Until at last, on September 21, 1993, we secured passage of Senate Resolution 102, which referred S. 840, the bill we introduced for the relief of the estate of Dr. Braude, to the Court of Claims for consideration as a congressional reference action. The measure compelled the Court to determine the facts underlying Dr. Braude's claim and to report back to Congress on its findings. 
The Court held a hearing in November 1995 and on March 7, 1996 Judge Roger B. Andewelt issued his verdict that the USIA had wrongfully dismissed Dr. Braude and intentionally concealed the reason for her termination. He concluded that such actions constituted an equitable claim for which compensation was due. Forty-three years after her dismissal from the USIA and 8 years after her death, the Court found in favor of the estate of Dr. Braude. 
Justice Department attorneys reached a settlement with lawyers representing Dr. Braude's estate concerning the monetary damages. In due time, $200,000 in damages were appropriated by Congress. 
I am happy to report that Beatrice Braude's estate has just received a check from the Department of Justice. Fully forty-five years after her wrongful dismissal and ten years after her death, Beatrice Braude's reputation has been restored and the United States government has paid her estate for the damages it inflicted during a dark period of our history. The money will be donated to Hunter College, the institution from which Dr. Braude received her bachelor's degree. Happily, students at Hunter College are now learning a more balanced history of the Cold War. We are now not in the least concerned about the infiltration of the government by ideological enemies. With the end of the Cold War we are able to learn much more of the facts of the Communist threats we faced. Our response to that threat was certainly mixed and I am pleased that we have been able to set the matter of Beatrice Braude to right. 
Senator D'Amato and I wish to express our profound gratitude to Joan L. Kutcher and Christopher N. Sipes of Covington & Burling, two of the many lawyers who have handled Dr. Braude's case on a pro bono basis over the years. It is thanks to their tireless dedication that history has been made and Dr. Braude's name has been cleared.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, nearly a year-and-a-half since I wrote President Clinton urging him to appoint a high level aide to handle the Year 2000 Computer Problem, I am encouraged that the President has made this issue a top priority, and named John Koskinen to chair a Presidential Year 2000 Council. 
The President's council has many similarities to the Commission/Task Force that would have been created by my bill, S. 22, which I introduced on the first day of the 105th Congress (1/21/97). This all has come about in no small part because of the tireless efforts of Representative Steve Horn and his House Government Reform Subcommittee. I look forward to working closely with Mr. Koskinen. 
Having spent two years studying, and warning of, the lagging progress of the agencies on this issue, I should warn Mr. Koskinen that with fewer than two years remaining, he faces what looks to be the 13th labor of Hercules.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise for the simple purpose of simply informing the Senate of a very happy occasion in the very near future. It will be the dedication of the Ronald Reagan International Trade Building at 16th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, the largest Federal building, as it happens, in the city and the completion, after 60 or 70 years--70 years of the Federal Triangle proposal which was begun by Andrew Mellon under the Presidency of Herbert Hoover for whom the Commerce Building across from 16th Street is named. 
The Ronald Reagan Building was--it should be noted that he signed the bill on August 21, 1987, the Federal Triangle Development Act. I had offered the measure here. It passed, very happily, and authorized the construction of an international, cultural and trade center on that site--a billion dollars worth of real estate. The site was cleared in 1928 and remained a parking lot until now. I remember writing a proposal for President Kennedy on the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue--a parking lot of surpassing ugliness. 
But then in 1995, with the building up and about to be running, Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand, who represented the District in which the President lives, introduced a bill to name it for him. Senator Dole cosponsored it here. It was passed unanimously, I should think, in both bodies. And on December 22, 1995, in a very fine ceremony in the Oval Office, President Clinton signed that bill. Speaker Gingrich, Mr. Dole, Mr. Daschle, the Vice President, and the Senator from New York were there. Alas, Representative Seastrand had a vote and could not come. 
The building is a 2-century building. It will be there for a very long while. We own the land. It will save money because we will move people from rented space to Government space in the same manner that the Judiciary Building now flanks Union Station but it is a congressional building. It is on Federal land. It is a lease-to-own project. In about 25 years we will have it. We are already paying less rent than we were paying in rented space because we own the land. It is a handsome building. It is a triumphal building. 
The architectural critic of the Washington Post, Benjamin Forgey, has given it his very warm endorsement. It has a great atrium. As you walk in it, you see the names, Ronald Reagan and International Trade Organization Building--the Ronald Reagan Building, and in it the National Trade Center. You know you are at a special place designed for, authorized, and built by a very 
special man, and now to be named for that man in a ceremony that I hope will be joyous, celebratory, and on the edge sad as we consider the condition of our former President, but proud that he was just that. 
I thank the Chair. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.

And I hope people will find time for it. There is nothing like it that will have happened in our city--well, for those who do not know the history, the Federal Triangle was moving along very well. The crash came, and they stopped--boom--they just stopped. Now we have finished it. President Kennedy envisioned it. President Reagan made it possible. And we are naming it for President Reagan.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today's New York Times has confirmed what many on the forefront of fixing the Year 2000 Computer Problem have already learned. Namely, that the problem is not just a programming glitch within software (programs run on the computer), but a larger crisis of identifying and renovating hardware (the computer itself). 
As the Times story relates: `The problem was first thought to be a programming glitch. But as the F.A.A. is demonstrating, the line between hardware and software is not so clear, because of computer instructions, called micro-code, that are built in and are more basic than the programs the computer runs. In some instances, the answer may be the wholesale replacement of computers that might otherwise have run for years. Early indications are that many airlines will also throw out numerous computers.' 
Like many private sector businesses, the FAA is finding that it may have to replace the interrelated computer systems themselves--in this case, systems that provide for the safety of air flight in America. While some programmers at the FAA believe the systems can be debugged without replacing them, the company which built the hardware, IBM, has recommended replacing the machines. 
There is a lesson to be learned here. Consultants confronted with this problem have told me this all along. The problem is deeper than the programs. It deals with the micro-code beneath the programs. This micro-code is in everything from our telecommunications systems to the personal computer on your desk--essentially the infrastructure of the company or agency. 
Thus, we peel back another layer of the onion. The FAA is taking multiple approaches to its fix: a combination of debugging and replacement. On the one hand, debugging old systems risks that they won't be fully tested until after the year 2000. On the other hand, replacing them costs millions upon millions. When the maker of the machines--in this case IBM--recommends replacement, and a failed effort to debug the machines could mean lives lost in air accidents across the country, I would prefer we lean heavily on the replacement approach. 
With fewer than two years until January 1, 2000, this lesson must be learned quickly and throughout the Federal Government. A few Chief Information Officers who are ahead of the curve on this issue are similarly discovering they not only have to fix the application codes, but they also have to make their infrastructure--telecommunication systems, micro-computers, and electrical components--year 2000 compliant. 
In the few months ahead, agencies must be ready and willing to admit the extent of their problems, and find solutions that will be balanced between debugging and replacement. At the same time, we in Congress must be ready and willing to assist agencies in what is beginning to look a lot like a matter of damage control.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to call to your attention a most momentous and joyful occasion. Theresa and Joseph Palmieri of Brooklyn, New York will celebrate their fiftieth wedding anniversary on January 31, 1998. 
Theresa and Joseph were wed at Saint Rosalie Catholic Church in Brooklyn, New York on January 31, 1948. The couple was introduced at a `Welcome Home' for Joseph after his return from service during World War II. Living and working on Long Island, New York for the past thirty-five years, the Palmieri family includes daughters Jo Ann and Theresa, sons Paul and Joseph, and seven grandchildren. 
In an era when nearly half of all couples married today will see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both instructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment of `till death do us part . . .' seriously, demonstrating successfully the timeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. 
Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and the entire Palmieri family in recognizing the wonderful sense of achievement and happiness that marks the golden wedding anniversary of Joseph and Theresa Palmieri.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the members of the Jewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway in the Bronx recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of David Edelstein's tenure as their executive director. 
Twenty years ago the Bronx was a virtual, albeit not entirely appropriate, synonym for urban decay and middle-class flight. The Jewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway is one of the dynamic grassroots neighborhood groups that have helped bring about a dramatic change in this proud borough. 
Much of the credit for the council's success belongs to its indefatigable executive director. David Edelstein came to the Jewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway on September 7, 1977. He helped establish the council's programs of social service, community development, Jewish cultural enrichment, and civic improvement. He pioneered the creation of programs that led to the reinvestment of over $17 million in the neighborhood's multifamily housing stock and played a key role in the creation of programs that helped settle over 3,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood. David's leadership has enabled the council to sponsor programs that assure the availability of Jewish education for all neighborhood youngsters. 
David established relationships with New York City's major Jewish organizations, helping to assure that needy families in Pelham Parkway could be helped with the resources available from those agencies. The council distributes over $25,000 in emergency and/or supplemental food to over 500 needy families every year. Hundreds of people have been helped with emergency home care, transportation for the homebound, eviction prevention, and other forms of emergency assistance. 
David has helped the Jewish Community Council become the unified voice of the Jewish community in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood. Working with the council's active board of directors and maintaining relationships with the police, medical centers, ¨S12721­elected officials, and others whose decisions impact on the community's quality of life, David has worked to assure cooperation and consensus on issues of community concern. 
My childhood friend, the late distinguished New York State Senator Joseph Galiber worked closely with David Edelstein and was fond of noting the Jewish Community Council's many strengths and successes. I know I speak for all of my colleagues in the Senate when I congratulate David Edelstein and the Jewish Community Council of Pelham Parkway on two decades of inspired leadership.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the German Government has long recognized its moral obligation to assist the survivors of the Holocaust. The landmark reparations agreements of the early 1950's between the West German Government and Jewish groups were predicated on this simple premise. Yet, as years go by, it has become increasingly apparent that a large number of survivors, particularly those living in Eastern and Central Europe, were excluded from these agreements and are now being denied assistance on the flimsiest of technical grounds. As a result, in July Senators Graham, Hatch, and Dodd joined me in introducing Senate Concurrent Resolution 39. I am pleased that the Senate will take up this important issue today. 
The need for such legislation was reinforced only last week. On November 5, Judge Heinz Sonnenberger in Germany upheld just 1 of 22 claims made by a group of Jewish women seeking payment for their work as slave laborers at Auschwitz. The other claims were dismissed by the judge on the grounds that the women had already received compensation under Germany's Federal Compensation Law. This decision represents the German Government's intractable attitude toward survivors of Nazi slave labor, however, it also presents a small window of hope for the survivors of slave labor who until now have been denied compensation by the German Government. 
The German Government has continually dealt with the survivors of Nazi persecution in a heartless, bureaucratic manner, basing its decisions on technical questions and eschewing a moral obligation to aid all survivors regardless of past compensation, current financial status, or amount of pain suffered. This practice stands in sharp contrast to the generous disability pensions paid by the German Government to former members of the Waffen-SS and their families. Until last year, when the German Supreme Court ruled that cases of compensation for slave labor could be taken up by the German courts, survivors of slave labor had been told that they should address their claims to the companies that used slave labor and not the German Government. Often companies had already paid a lump sum toward compensation and refused to hear further claims, while other companies, which had never paid claims, refused to pay them altogether. After 50 years of avoidance, it is time for the German Government to take the opportunity this ruling provides and address the issue of compensation to slave laborers head on. 
Judge Sonnenberger's ruling is the first time that a German court has awarded compensation to a survivor of slave labor to be paid by the German Government. The possibility that this ruling is a precedent may be a bright spot in this otherwise regrettable decision. Perhaps other survivors of slave labor, who have never received compensation from the German Government, will be emboldened by this ruling and bring their own cases forward. This progress is tempered by the rejection of the other 21 claims. In this regard, Judge Sonnenberger's decision carries on the German Government's practice of overlooking humanitarian considerations when judging compensation claims made by the survivors of Nazi persecution. 
In order to encourage a change in the German Government's position, Senate Concurrent Resolution 39 urges the German Government to expand and simplify its reparations system, to provide reparations to survivors in Eastern and Central Europe, and to set up a fund to help cover the medical expenses of Holocaust survivors. Although half a century has passed since the end of World War II, it is important to remember how many chapters opened by the devastating war remain unfinished. I hope this action will help bring the issue of reparations for survivors of Nazi persecution the fore, and encourage the German Government to make appropriate changes so that the elderly survivors of the Holocaust receive appropriate reparations.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense of the Senate resolution commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of Dorothy Day, a woman who embodies the very idea of service to others. I am pleased to be joined by Senators D'Amato, Wellstone, Levin, Dodd, Torricelli, Reed, Durbin, Mikulski, and Kennedy in paying tribute to her life. 
The life of Dorothy Day is central to modern Catholic social thought. Hers was a radical brand of discipleship, akin to what the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer described as `costly grace' in The Cost of Discipleship. She lived a life of voluntary poverty and hardship, forsaking material comfort and opting to live among the poor whom she served. Just as Jesus befriended the tax collector and the prostitute, Dorothy Day embraced the drug addicted and the disenfranchised. She saw Christ in everyone--especially in the poor and the oppressed--and treated people accordingly. In short, she lived the Gospel. 
In 1933, Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin joined to found the Catholic Worker Movement and the Catholic Worker newspaper `to realize in the individual and society the express and implied teachings of Christ.' That same year, they opened the first Catholic Worker Hospitality house, St. Joseph's House, in Manhattan's Lower East Side. The country was, by then, in the throes of the Great Depression, a period of suffering unknown to this country before or since. Dorothy Day ministered to the physical and spiritual needs of the legions of poor who arrived on the doorstep at St. Joseph House. Today, some 64 years after its creation, the Catholic Worker Movement remains a vibrant legacy to her life. There are now more than 125 Catholic Worker `Houses of Hospitality' in the United States and around the world. 
Perhaps Dorothy Day's life was summed up best by those at the University of Notre Dame who bestowed the Laetare Medal upon her in 1972 for `comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable virtually all of her life.' Indeed she did and we are all the better for it. 
I ask unanimous consent that the text of a tribute by Patrick Jordan, who knew Dorothy Day from his days living at the Catholic Worker, from Commonweal and the text of the Resolution be printed into the Record.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we approach the end of the 1st session of the 105th Congress, I would like to implore the Senate for one final time to consider the urgency of the year 2000 crisis. This matter has been much discussed and reported, but little action has taken place. In fact, the General Accounting Office last week released a report that the Social Security Administration, once thought to be at the fore of the solution, faces a possible crash of several crucial systems dealing with disability determination services. 
This report is indicative of the enormity of the problem facing the computer systems of the Federal Government. I introduced S. 22 on the first day of this session to establish a bipartisan national commission to handle this problem--as a civil defense task force would. Try as they might, officials at the Office of Management and Budget simply cannot address the enormity of the task at hand. 
Every few days I have attempted to keep my colleagues informed of the latest facets of the problem. On this last day of the first session let me add but one more twist to the immense but manageable problem. If only we would act. In the latest U.S. News and World Report, John Marks reports on the troublesome coincidence of converting to the new European currency at the time of the turn of the century. He writes: 
Even before it is introduced on January 1, 1999, the long awaited euro threatens to cost American business $30 billion or more to buy new software and recode old programs, as companies with interests on the other side of the Atlantic attempt to adapt to the new currency . . . the two problems would seem to be unrelated. But the coincidence in timing--the millennium bug and the currency change arrive within a year of each other--has transformed them into a larger single crisis for many companies. 
Thus, international companies are forced to deal with two conversions in the next 2 years; and not surprisingly, experts predict there will be a drought in the supply of consultants who know how to do both. 
Again, U.S. News: 
Last year, after dire warnings of a technological disaster at the dawn of the new century, companies rushed to hire programmers to save the day. In doing so, they created a labor shortage at a critical moment. Work on both the millennium bug and the euro transition requires knowledge of outdated COBOL computer systems. So all of a sudden, most of the programmers who might be deployed to manage the transition to the euro already have day jobs. 
As I have mentioned before on this floor, we must also consider the conversion to the Euro and the labor shortage created over the next few years when we consider the size of the problem at hand. 
The year 2000 problem is now fairly well known; the need for action plainly clear. With the legislative year coming to a close, I am hopeful my colleagues will realize this fact in the restful period between now and January 27 and be eager to take action on my bill--S. 22 with 18 copsonsors--in the year to come.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, December 15, 1997 will mark the 100th anniversary of the Order of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Atonement. The Order was founded by Father Lewis T. Watson and Mother Lurana White in Garrison, New York with the goal of promoting Christian unity. The Friars and Sisters continue their mission work through the promotion of the Week of Christian Unity and the operation of ecumenical centers and libraries. 
Through the years, the Friars and Sisters of the Atonement have remained in Garrison where they now operate the Graymoor Ecumenical and Religious Institute. At Graymoor they publish a monthly magazine, Ecumenical Trends, and operate St. Christopher's Inn, a temporary shelter for homeless men, whom they refer to as `Brothers Christopher' or Christ Bearers. 
The influence and the good work of the Friars and Sisters extends well beyond the Hudson Highlands region of New York, reaching throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. They operate day care centers, Retreat Houses, Head Start programs, and shelters for battered wives and children. They minister to the poor, feed the hungry, and embrace the marginalized worldwide. Not only do they seek unity of the Christian community, but also unity of the human spirit and unity of the human community. 
True to their cause of Christian unity, they have dedicated their lives to the hope `that all may be one. . .that the world may believe.' I commend their single-heartedness and congratulate them on the occasion of their 100th anniversary.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 867, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. This legislation promotes adoption and makes important reforms in foster care. It includes provisions drawn from two bills I co-sponsored earlier this year, S. 511 [the `SAFE' Act] and S. 1195 [the `PASS' Act]. We have been able to work out bipartisan legislation with two goals we all share--ensuring the safety of children in the child welfare system, and finding permanent homes for as many children in foster care as possible. 
Children in the child welfare system, victims of abuse and neglect, are among the most vulnerable in our society. Just this week, in my own state, we learned of another tragic death, that of little Sabrina Green. Sabrina, nine years old, lived in the Bronx. After both her mother and her latest foster mother died, Sabrina went to live with her oldest sister, Yvette Green. After what appears to have been months of abuse--such as burning Sabrina's hand over a stove as punishment for taking food out of the refrigerator--she was found beaten to death. Her sister and her sister's boyfriend have been accused of this crime. 
We owe it to these abused and neglected children to do our best on their behalf. And I am encouraged that a group of our colleagues has worked together--on a bipartisan basis--to develop this legislation. I thank Senators Chafee, Rockefeller, Roth, Craig, Jeffords, Kerrey, Coats, DeWine, Landrieu, and the others who have played important roles in this effort. 
This bill clarifies that the health and safety of the child are to be the `paramount' concern when making the difficult decisions involved in the child welfare system and it contains several other `safety first' provisions, such as requiring criminal records checks for prospective adoptive and foster parents. The bill accelerates the process for determining the permanent placement for a child in foster care, so that children do not spend years bouncing among foster homes. H.R. 867 also promotes adoption by providing states with financial incentives to get children in foster care adopted, and by breaking down health insurance and geographic barriers to adoption. 
This legislation is an important step forward in our efforts to help abused and neglected children. I am proud to support it.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senators Chafee, Bond, Warner, and Baucus are to be commended upon their successful negotiations with the House to produce a short-term extension to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] of 1991. This bill will provide the States with the necessary funding while Congress completes its consideration of a 6-year authorization bill early next year. 
I am pleased that the agreement authorizes the States to spend up to $9.7 billion in highway funds and up to nearly $3 billion in transit funds over the next 7 months. The bill also provides an additional $5.5 billion in advance contract authority for the future continuation of our highway program. 
The bill provides States with flexibility to transfer money among program categories. The Secretary of Transportation is required to ensure, however, that all transferred funds be restored to their original intended use once a long-term bill ISTEA is passed. I intend to join with my colleagues to make sure that the Secretary faithfully carries out this directive and that none of ISTEA's key environmental programs, like CMAQ and Enhancements, will suffer because of the flexibility granted in this measure. The bill also provides $78.5 million directly to the metropolitan planning organizations, so they will not be adversely affected by this flexibility provision. 
New York will be apportioned $325 million in new highway funds and $380 million in transit funds. With its existing balances, New York will be able to spend nearly $900 million over the next half year on transportation. I am confident that with this measure, New York will be able to maintain its highway and transit construction program over the short term. 
I am concerned, however, that come May, the House and Senate will still not be close to agreement and we will face the need to pass another short-term measure. It is essential that the process for passing any future ISTEA extensions be inclusive and address the needs of the transit program, which, unlike highways, will have almost no unobligated balances by May. ISTEA's goal was to create an intermodal transportation system and I will fight any attempt to divorce highway needs from transit needs. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion on the Senate floor in the last week in the matter of the fast-track legislation, as we refer to it, about the trade deficit and the size of the present deficit and the projections that it will increase. 
It has been suggested that this deficit began to take form in the context of the 1974 legislation providing fast-track authority to the President, and that to extend that authority would only be to continue and deepen that deficit. 
My very good friend from Maryland has been I think of this view. My colleague and friend from North Dakota has proposed a commission to look into the whole matter, which can do no harm as long as we keep to the economics of this matter as it is now understood. 
Many persons have opposed fast-track legislation because of the deficit, and it seems to me necessary, useful to put into the Record the fact that these are not in fact connected any more than in 1974 the fast-track authority represented some break in the Executive role in trade. It did not. From 1934 on, since the time of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, the President has had one form or another of negotiating authority delegated to him by the Congress in the aftermath of the fearsome experience of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, when we brought a tariff bill to the Senate floor and in the end disabled our own economy, or helped to do, and set the world economy into a downward spiral. If you would list five events that led to the Second World War, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 would be one. And we have not had a tariff bill in the Chamber as such since 1930. We have proceeded in this mode, through periods of trade surpluses, trade deficits and relatively evenly balanced accounts. 
The most important thing to state is that the current trade deficit is not a result of trade policy. It is a result of budget policy. It is a result of the decisions which I think now are behind us in which during a long 15 year period we incurred an enormous national debt in consequence of a long sequence of very large budget deficits. This is not to say that the budget deficit is the only determinant of trade deficit, but it is the key indicator of the matter because it is the relationship between domestic savings, which until this year has been substantially reduced by annual Federal deficits in excess of $100 billion, and domestic investment. 
That is the key, but not only factor in the sense of which, as economists would say, the trade deficit is a dependent variable. I have a chart to make this point. It is not any more complicated than most of the charts we bring to the floor these days in the age of television. 
In 1975, the United States was a creditor nation. We owned net foreign assets of some $74 billion. By 1996, we had become a debtor nation with a worldwide negative net investment of $871 billion. You go from a surplus to being a net debtor in the amount of almost $1 trillion. Foreign investors have more capital in the United States than we have abroad on balance, and that reflects the increase in our Federal debt. 
In 1975, we had a Federal debt of $395 billion. In 1996, we had a Federal debt of $3.733 trillion. The net result was a trade deficit in a manner that is entirely predictable. What we understand about economics, the general consensus of economists is such that if you were to propose that such a change in net budget deficits would take place, the economics profession overwhelmingly would say then your trade balances will change in the same direction. 
It is also clear that foreign persons will end up with the dollars that we need to borrow. Given that our savings rate is so low because our deficits are so high, foreign persons will end up with dollars to lend us only if they export more to us than we export to them. 
Last week it was noted on the floor that an October 1997 report entitled `The Trade Deficit: Where Does It Come From And What Does It Do?' by Peter Morici, of the Economic Strategy Institute, a group founded in 1989, in effect challenged the traditional mainstream economic view that trade deficits are closely related to the imbalance between domestic savings and domestic investment. Again, I say, Mr. President, it is the mainstream view of economists that this is a pattern that is almost automatic; that the trade deficit is a dependent variable related to the level of domestic savings. 
I am not going to argue, dispute the fact that the causes of the trade deficit are complex. To quote from Dr. Morici's report, he says, `History seems to confirm the importance of multidirectional causality.' 
Here is an able economist looking at the conventional wisdom, which I have been setting forth, and saying, `No, matters are more complex than that,' which one welcomes. That is how any science, any field of inquiry advances. When persons challenge the accepted judgment of the time, sometimes a new paradigm emerges. 
But, in arguing the importance of multidirectional causality, Dr. Morici does not deny the importance of the deficits of the early 1980's. He writes. 
. . . the combination of Reagan Administration tax cuts and new defense spending increased the combined government current and capital account deficit from $34 billion in 1981 to about $146 billion in 1983, and the demands imposed by the U.S. Treasury on capital markets drove U.S. interest rates well above German and Japanese levels. 
High U.S. interest rates served the purpose of attracting foreign private investment to finance growing U.S. government deficits. * * * 
I will take the liberty of repeating that sentence: `High U.S. interest rates served the purpose of attracting foreign private investment to finance growing U.S. government deficits.' 
In turn, these foreign private capital flows created much increased demand for dollars in foreign-exchange markets and the real exchange rate for the dollar rose more than 50 percent. In large part, it was the appreciation of the dollar that caused the trade deficit to rise from $16 billion in 1981 to more than $100 billion a year from 1984 to 1988. 
Dr. Morici's analysis points to the causality. It may be more complex than we now suppose, but basically, if you have as large a budget deficit as we ran in the 1980's, you will raise interest rates, your dollar will appreciate, and the result is a trade deficit. 
Earlier, I was commenting with my friend from Michigan, Senator Levin, that the strong dollar of the 1980's seemed to many people a statement that somehow we had a strong economy. Just the opposite. And Senator Levin suggested, if we can, we get rid of that usage `strong dollar' or `weak dollar' as if they were some reflection on the general state of the economy as against the price of money, which is what it is all about. 
What has puzzled many is why the process has not reversed since we have brought the deficit down. Why hasn't the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit has declined? This is a fair question. However, economists have never argued that budget deficits caused trade deficits but, rather, that trade deficits result when domestic saving is not sufficient to support domestic investment. 
In the early 1980's, it was easy to identify the huge Federal budget deficits as the source of the savings shortfall. Now it is more complex, but let me note several factors. We have a strong economy with expansion now in its seventh year. For the first time in 10 years the growth of real gross domestic product has averaged more than 4 percent for four quarters. Not unexpectedly, with a strong economy straining at full employment, investment has increased over the past 5 years from about 9 percent of GDP to 10 percent as firms strive to meet demands by adding new plants. At 
the same time--and here is a mystery for which you will find no explanation on the part of this Senator--at the same time, private saving has declined from about 16 percent of GDP to about 15 percent during this period. That is why, during the period 1992 to the present, the trade deficit as a percentage of GDP has not declined, even as the budget deficit has fallen dramatically. 
In an op-ed article last month in the Wall Street Journal, Robert Eisner, a distinguished professor emeritus at Northwestern University and former president of the American Economic Association, reminded us of the gains from trade that accrue to all nations. He wrote:

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Adlai E. Stevenson remarked of Eleanor Roosevelt that `She would rather light candles than curse the darkness and her glow has warmed the world.' So it is with my dear friend and colleague, Representative Floyd Flake of Queens, who will be retiring from Congress this Saturday, November 15. Few individuals can match his accomplishments, which have materially and spiritually benefited so many. I view his departure as bittersweet. He is going home to his church, answering God's call `to a greater ministry and to a greater work,' as he has put it. Surely, his congregants will be happier for his decision. But we will sorely miss him here in Congress. 
Representative Flake was born in Los Angeles and raised in Houston--1 of 13 children born to parents with fifth- and sixth-grade educations. Modest circumstances. But in the words of an October 19, 1997 New York Times magazine article by James Traub, `they (people who told Flake he would never go to college) hadn't reckoned on his mother, who taught the kids how to sew and wash and cook, or his fiercely self-improving father.' 
Representative Flake received an undergraduate degree from Wilberforce University, the first black college in America, founded in 1856 in Ohio under the auspices of the African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] Church and named after the great English statesman and abolitionist, William Wilberforce. From there, on to graduate study at Payne Theological Seminary and Northeastern University and jobs early in his career as a Head Start social worker and market analyst for Xerox. 
In 1976, Representative Flake--barely 31--became pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Jamaica, Queens. At that time, the church congregation numbered about 1,200; the church's annual budget was about $250,000. There were three employees. Now, some 20 years later, the congregation has grown to nearly 9,000 souls. The church and its subsidiaries have an annual budget exceeding $24 million. Tithes and offerings alone exceed $5 million--this from a mostly middle-class congregation. 
When considering Reverend Flake's stewardship, the Parable of the Mustard Seed comes to mind. Allen A.M.E. Church-sponsored community development enterprises now include a 300-unit apartment complex for the elderly; the Allen Christian School, which has an enrollment of some 400 elementary students--and a growing waiting list; hundreds of single-family and two-family homes; a strip mall; an office complex; a home care agency; a credit union; and a transportation company. The Allen A.M.E. Church and its subsidiaries employ 800 people. Only Kennedy Airport employs more people in the Sixth District. 
In the middle of this remarkable stewardship, he earned a Doctorate of Ministry degree from the United Theological Seminary in Dayton, OH, and he became a Member of Congress. He has ably represented the Sixth District, which covers southern and southeastern Queens, since 1986. As a result of his efforts, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration are building major facilities in the district. As a senior member of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, he has been an indefatigable architect of innovative public and private urban investment programs. While other politicians have abandoned urban communities, Floyd Flake has found ways for such communities not only to survive, but to thrive. While others curse the darkness, Floyd Flake lights candles. 
Perhaps the capstone of his accomplishments is the new Allen A.M.E. Church cathedral on Merrick Boulevard. The $23 million cathedral is 93,000 square feet and seats 2,500. It is the largest church structure to be built in New York City since 1954. Heinrich Heine remarked that it takes more than mere opinion to erect a cathedral, it takes conviction. Indeed it does. Reverend Flake secured a $15 million mortgage for the project from Chase Manhattan Bank Corp: the largest loan Chase has ever made to a religious institution. That's conviction. 
Given all of these commitments, it is understandable that Floyd Flake feels he must go home and minister to his church community full-time. The community will be richer for his presence. We here will be poorer. 
Mr. President, the inscription on Sir Christopher Wren's tomb in St. Paul's Cathedral reads, Si monumentum requiris circumspice. `If you would see the man's monument, look around.' If you would see Floyd Flake's monument, go to Jamaica, or to St. Alban's, or to Rosedale, or to Laurelton, or to nearly any neighborhood in Queens, and look around. 
And so, to my friend, his wife Elaine, his daughters, Aliya and Nailah, and his sons, Rasheed and Hasan, I say, `Godspeed.'

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Friday, the 7th of November 1997, on the occasion of the bicentennial of the birth of Joseph Henry, the Joseph Henry Medal was presented to Dr. Frederick Seitz at a dinner of the Smithsonian Council. Clearly, this was a special occasion, and it was singularly appropriate that Frederick Seitz should be the honoree. The citation of the splendid gold medal reads: 
The Board of Regents gratefully presents the Joseph Henry Medal to Frederick Seitz in recognition of his manifold contributions to The Smithsonian Institution. His advancement of the Smithsonian's research and educational programs in the sciences, history, and the history of science has exemplified the ideals of James Smithson's mandate . . . `for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.'--May 4, 1997.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Thursday, in the Wall Street Journal, two articles appeared highlighting additional facets of the year 2000 [Y2K] problem. While the computer and business industries have been the primary focus of news articles in the past, these reports focused on the legal and accounting fields. And today, in an editorial in the New York Post, the editors warn that `attorneys hope to make a killing off the so called Year 2000 problem.' 
In the Journal article entitled `Threat of Computer Glitch in 2000 Has Lawyers Seeing Dollar Signs,' the authors report that `corporate lawyers are urging clients to review their information systems and write warranties into their contracts.' The possibility of future litigation has caused New York law firms, such as Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, Flom, to establish special groups of attorneys to ensure that all contracts contain Y2K warranties. 
The other article, `CPA Group to Issue Guidelines on Costs of Year 2000 Bug,' reports that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants will advise `auditors on how to push corporations to disclose and account' for Y2K costs. Further, many companies have yet to begin the process of changing their systems to alleviate the problem, and are unaware of the enormous costs that lie ahead. This could well lead to misstatement of profits or loses of 10 percent or more. Lastly, in their no-holds-barred manner, the Post editors write: `this [problem] could make the litigation over breast implants and asbestos look like chump-change wrangling.' My dutiful peer, Senator Bennett of Utah, has been looking into these matters, as Chair of the Banking Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology. And for that we are most grateful. Yet his voice, like that of Congressman Stephen Horn, is being lost among the din over many less pressing issues. 
Mr President, we are beginning to see the ripple-like effects of this most serious issue. The overall costs have been estimated as high as a half a trillion dollars, and that widespread failure to comply could lead to a global recession, in the opinion of New York Federal Reserve Bank President William J. McDonough. 
Above all, from our standpoint, we have an obligation to get our own house in order. The lagging response of the U.S. Government to this problem, a relative benchmark, as the United States is ahead of most countries, is without excuse. With just under 800 days left, we cannot have half of our agencies still assessing how many mission critical systems will be affected. This is but the first phase of three--renovation and testing/implementation are the other two. We need an outside body to ensure this problem is fixed. My bill, S. 22, will do just that.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, in introducing legislation to establish a commission to study the Federal statistical system. Congressman Stephen Horn of California and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York plan on introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. This legislation is similar to bills I introduced in September 1996, and again at the beginning of this Congress. 
The commission to study the Federal statistical system would consist of 15 Presidential and congressional appointees with expertise in fields such as actuarial science, finance, and economics. Its members would conduct a thorough review of the U.S. statistical system, and issue a report including recommendations on whether statistical agencies should be consolidated. 
Of course, we have an example of a consolidated statistical agency just across the northern border. Statistics Canada, the most centralized statistical agency among OECD countries, was established in November, 1918 as a reaction to a familiar problem. At that time, the Canadian Minister of Industry was trying to obtain an estimate of the manpower resources that Canada could commit to the war effort. And he got widely different estimates from statistical agencies scattered throughout the government. Consolidation seemed the way to solve this problem, and so it happened--as it can in a parliamentary government--rather quickly, just as World War I ended. 
Last spring, a member of my staff met in Ottawa with the Assistant Chief Statistician of Statistics Canada. He reported that Statistics Canada is doing quite well. Decisions about the allocation of resources among statistical functions are made at the highest levels of government because the Chief Statistician of Statistics Canada holds a position equivalent to Deputy Cabinet Minister. He communicates directly with Deputy Ministers in other Cabinet Departments. In contrast, in the United States, statistical agencies are buried several levels below the Cabinet Secretaries, so it is difficult for the heads of these statistical agencies to bring issues to the attention of high-ranking administration officials and Congress. 
Statistics are part of our constitutional arrangement, which provides for a decennial census that, among other purposes, is the basis for apportionment of membership in the House of Representatives. I quote from article I, section I: 
. . . enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within ever subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. 
But, while the Constitution directed that there be a census, there was, initially, no Census Bureau. The earliest censuses were conducted by U.S. Marshals. Later on, statistical bureaus in State governments collected the data, with a Superintendent of the Census overseeing from Washington. It was not until 1902 that a permanent Bureau of the Census was created by the Congress, housed initially in the Interior Department. In 1903 the Bureau was transferred to the newly established Department of Commerce and Labor. 
The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, which was originally an independent body, began collecting data in 1866. It too was transferred to the new Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, but then was put in the Treasury Department in 1913 following ratification of the 16th amendment, which gave Congress the power to impose an income tax.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague Senator D'Amato in introducing a bill that will authorize a small but most significant addition to the National Park system by designating the Lower East Side Tenement Museum a national historic site. For 150 years New York City's Lower East Side has been the most vibrant, populous, and famous immigrant neighborhood in the Nation. From the first waves of Irish and German immigrants to Italians and Eastern European Jews to the Asian, Latin, and Caribbean immigrants arriving today, the Lower East Side has provided millions their first American home. 
For many of them that home was a brick tenement; six or so stories, no elevator, maybe no plumbing, maybe no windows, a business on the ground floor, and millions of our forbearers upstairs. The Nation has with great pride preserved log cabins, farm houses, and other symbols of our agrarian roots. We have reopened Ellis Island to commemorate and display the first stop for 12 million immigrants who arrived in New York City. 
Until now we have not preserved a sample of urban, working class life as part of the immigrant experience. For many of those disembarked on Ellis Island the next stop was a tenement on the Lower East Side, such as the one at 97 Orchard Street. It is here that the Lower East Side Tenement Museum shows us what that next stop was like. 
The tenement at 97 Orchard was built in the 1860's, during the first phase of tenement construction. It provided housing for 20 families on a plot of land planned for a single family residence. Each floor had four 3-room apartments, each of which had two windows in one of the rooms and none in the others. The privies were out back, as was the spigot that provided water for everyone. The public bathhouse was down the street. 
In 1900 this block was the most crowded per acre on Earth. Conditions improved at 97 Orchard Street after the passage of the New York Tenement House Act of 1901, though the crowding remained. Two toilets were installed on each floor. A skylight was installed over the stairway and interior windows were cut in the walls to allow some light throughout each apartment. For the first time the ground floor became commercial space. In 1918 electricity was installed. Further improvements were mandated in 1935, but the owner of this building chose to board it up rather than follow the new regulations. It remained boarded up for 60 years until the idea of a museum took hold. 
The tenement museum will keep at least one apartment in the dilapidated condition in which it was found when reopened, to show visitors the process of urban archaeology. Others are being restored to show how real families lived at different periods in the building's history. Across the street there are interpretive programs to better explain the larger experience of gaining a foothold on America in the Lower East Side of New York. There are also plans for programmatic ties with Ellis Island and its precursor, Castle Clinton. And the museum plans to play an active role in the immigrant community around it, further integrating the past and present immigrant experience on the Lower East Side. 
This bill designates the tenement museum a national historic site. It also authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a cooperative agreement with the museum to ensure the marking, interpretation, and preservation of the site. The Secretary will also coordinate with the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Castle Clinton sites to help with the interpretation of the immigrant experience. It will be a productive partnership. 
Mr. President, I believe the tenement museum provides an outstanding opportunity to preserve and present an important stage of the immigrant experience and the move for social change in our cities at the turn of the century. I know of no better place than 97 Orchard Street to do so, and no other place in the National Park system doing so already. I look forward to the realization of this grand idea, and I ask my colleagues for their support.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today we introduce a revised War Crimes Disclosure Act which Senators D'Amato, Dodd and I originally sponsored in the 104th Congress as a companion to a measure introduced by Representative Maloney. 
The measure is a simple one. It requires the disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act regarding individuals who participated in Nazi war crimes. This bill, which Senator DeWine has carefully crafted, builds on our original measure by expanding its scope to include information regarding stolen assets of the victims of Nazi war crimes, and by requiring a Governmentwide search of records to ensure the release of as many relevant documents as possible. A similar search for information regarding Nazi assets was recently conducted under the direction of Stuart Eizenstat, with significant results. 
Ideally, documents regarding Nazi war crimes would be made available to the public without further legislation and without having to go through the slow process involved in getting information through the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA]. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Researchers seeking information on Nazi war criminals are denied access to relevant materials in the possession of the United States Government, even when the disclosure of these documents no longer poses a threat to national security--if indeed such disclosure ever did. 
Perhaps the most important provision contained in the legislation is the balancing test. This requires that `there shall be a presumption that the public interest in the release of Nazi war criminal records outweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be expected to result from disclosure.' The provision is in keeping with the report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy which recommended that such a balancing test be applied in all classification decisions. 
The Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy was the second statutory examination of Government secrecy. I was honored to Chair the Commission; Representative Combest served as vice-chairman. Also serving on the Commission were John Deutch, Martin Faga, John Podesta, and Samuel Huntington. We presented our report to the President in March, and the congressional members of the Commission introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the Commission in May. 
We have welcomed the many editorials and feature articles supporting our efforts as, in the words of the Sacramento Bee, a `sensible, much-needed proposal for reforming runaway classification of secrets by the federal government.' And Albany's Times Union assessment that our bill represents a `bipartisan effort * * * to make more government documents accessible to the public and, in the process, make government more accountable.' 
Our's is a report that, I believe, sets out a new framework for how to think about Government secrecy. Beginning with the concept that secrecy should be understood as a form of Government regulation. In the words of the German sociologist Max Weber, writing some eight decades ago: 
Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration always tends to be an administration of `secret sessions'; in so far as it can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism. 
The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional interests make for secrecy. The concept of the `official secret' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond these specifically qualified areas. 
What we traditionally think of in this country as regulation concerns how citizens are to behave. Whereas public regulation involves what the citizen may do, secrecy concerns what that citizen may know. And the citizen does not know what may not be known. As our Commission stated: `Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of the regulation.' 
Thus, secrecy in the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated. It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it malfunctions. In our democracy, where the free exchange of ideas is so essential, it can be suffocating. 
We must develop what might be termed a competing `culture of openness' fully consistent with our interests in protecting national security, but in which power and authority are no longer derived primarily from one's ability to withhold information from others in Government and the public at large. 
The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is in keeping with the work of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. With the passing of time it becomes ever more important to document Nazi war crimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. The greater access which this legislation provides will add clarity to this important effort. I applaud those researchers who continue to pursue this important work. 
I would like to thank Representative Maloney for her original work on this subject in the House of Representatives and I would also thank Senator DeWine for joining me in this effort here in the Senate.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I simply would wish to say that I have listened with great respect to the Senator from Maryland as regards the time sequenced in which the fast-track legislation went into effect and the foreign trade deficit began to grow. 
I say two things. 
The first is that the essentials of the fast-track negotiations have been in place since 1934. Nothing that discontinuous occurred in 1974. What simply was required was at that time the trade negotiations turned from tariffs on things--machines, iron ore, oil, whatever--to the question of the more complex but growing area of services, intellectual property, and matters like that. That is what impels us to give the President negotiating authority beyond the simple reduction of tariffs. 
The reciprocal trade agreements that began back in 1934 said the President may cut these tariffs up to 50 percent, and proclaim it after he has reached it to his satisfaction and agreement. The increase in the trade deficit corresponds precisely to the onset of enormous budgetary deficits by the Federal Government. It is elemental bookkeeping of economics--that unless you have a very high savings rate, which we do not have, you will finance a Federal deficit by borrowing from abroad, and that borrowing will take the form of imports. In economics this is a fixed equation. One side equals the other. And at just that moment, as the Senator from Maryland pointed out, deficits begin to grow, we have the second oil shock followed by the huge deficits of the 1980's. 
They are an equivalence which comes almost at a level of bookkeeping. They have to happen. 
Now, we have on point where our deficits are disappearing and we should have every reason in the world to think that trade deficit will disappear as well--it need not do--if our savings remain at the low level they are. But if they return to a normal level, which we hope they will, now that the deficit is not using them up, or now that more resources are available, that deficit will shrink dramatically, or we will have to write all the textbooks over again.

He has kept a committee united, minus one vote, in an otherwise unanimous decision. He has been meticulous in his concern that American workers will have their interests pursued here, the environment will be looked after, but ladening these matters on trade negotiations will only ensure they will fail and not bring the benefits we desire.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a measure of ebullience. By a solid majority of both sides of the aisle, we have just voted to do exactly what our revered chairman said ought to be done, and reported how in the past it has been done. The vote was 69 to 31. I think that augurs well. 
I would particularly like to note a fact about this legislation which has been little remarked, the fact that with great felicity and sense of historic importance, the chairman has given to the bill the title the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997. The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, hearkening back almost two-thirds of a century to 1934 when Cordell Hull, a former member of the Finance Committee, as Secretary of State helped the Nation out of the ruin that had been brought about by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a tariff meant to raise living standards and do all the things that seem so easy if you don't think them through. 
If you were to make a list of five events that led to the 
Second World War and the horror of that war, that tariff bill of 1930 would be one of them. If there was a harbinger of the reemergence of the civilized world and the reinstitution of intelligent analysis of public policy, it was the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. 
I might like to take a preliminary effort to note that in 1934 the United States, in fact, did two things of note regarding legislation before the Senate today. We passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, and the President proposed and Congress agreed to our membership in the International Labor Organization, two parallel but distinct measures. We began opening our trade and in the same year, same Congress, moved to join the International Labor Organization for purposes not different than ones we have expounded in this legislation, which speaks directly to that issue. Now, the matter before the Senate is of the highest portent and urgency. Just yesterday in the Washington Post our--how do I say it? Has Bob Dole been gone long enough to be called fabled, legendary? Certainly vastly embraced by this institution on both sides of the aisle. Senator Dole, Republican candidate in the last election, wrote in yesterday's Post, `the fate of fast-track legislation this fall may determine whether the President ever will negotiate another free trade agreement.' He urged that we give the President this power, a power which every President since President Ford has had and which under the original Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act has been in place for two-thirds of a century. 
Since the fast-track authority lapsed, as it did 3 and one half years ago, the United States has effectively been reduced to the status of an observer as unprecedented new trading arrangements, bilateral and multilateral, have been put in place. The changes in trade and patterns and arrangements that you see very much correspond to the change in techniques of production, in modes of manufacture and in the information age of which we have heard so much. They reflect the technological underpinnings which have changed the economies of the developed world, are changing the developing world, and in consequence, change the economy. 
For example, as the chairman remarked, Mexico and Chile negotiated a free trade agreement in 1991 and now are engaged in talks to expand the scope of that agreement by the end of this year. On July 2 of this year, Canada's free trade agreement with Chile entered force, giving Canadian exports just that advantage, the 11-percent tariff advantage, that the chairman has spoken of. Remember, the pattern of Canadian production and exports is very like ours. We are in a competing world with them. We wish them every success. But there is no point in hindering our own ability to negotiate and trade in the same way. 
If I may remind the Senator, we have been here before. On March 4, 1974, President Nixon's Special Trade Representative, William D. Eberle, testified before the Finance Committee in support of the legislation that established the first fast-track procedures for non-tariff matters. He said, `Without the fast-track authority, our trading partners will continue to negotiate but they will do so bilaterally and regionally, to the probable exclusion of the United States.' 
Do not suppose that cannot happen again. The United States is at a position of unparalleled influence and importance in the world. That can produce an unparalleled resentment with consequences that will move through the generations to come. Do not be overconfident in a moment such as this, and certainly do not be fearful. We have nothing to fear from world trade. We gain from it. We have gained from it. And now I am confident with that resounding bipartisan vote, we will. 
Of course, in 1994 we created the World Trade Organization. It took us a long time. In the aftermath of World War II it had been understood we would have an international trade organization to correspond with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. That never came to pass. It came to grief, in point of fact, in the Finance Committee. 
The WTO, the World Trade Organization, is beginning negotiations on agricultural trade, protection of intellectual property. By intellectual property, think Silicon Valley, think Microsoft, think of all the innovations we have made in the world, and the innovators have the right to see their work protected. And, again, international trade in services, think banking, insurance, all those areas in which we have been particularly excluded in the developing world and which we can now negotiate. 
The Uruguay round of negotiations represented the first serious attempt to address barriers to American farm products, but a great deal needs to be done. The last area of economic activity which is freed from protection will always be farm matters. It is one of the great events of our age that the great agricultural States in this Nation have seen what trade can do for them and are supporting these measures. Agriculture is always protected, always subsidized, but in 1999, the World Trade Organization on that matter will begin and we ought to take these negotiations seriously. We ought to be part of them and now we will be. 
American farm exports in 1996 reached $60 billion in an overall global market estimated at something more than half a trillion. So we have something like 10 percent of that trade. This export sector alone represents about 1 million American jobs. 
A similar situation exists with respect to services trade, which was addressed for the first time in the Uruguay round, and the financial services, banking, insurance, securities, are scheduled to wrap up in December in an important round of talks. Another round will begin on January 1 of the year 2000 involving a full range of services, including such sectors as health care, motion pictures, and advertising, where American companies are among the strongest in the world. I don't think it would be in any way inappropriate to recall the remarks of President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China just a few feet off the floor here a week ago, in which he described the formative experience of his college years when he watched the film `Gone With the Wind.' 
It is America that makes the movies for the world to see. Getting them in is a matter of negotiation. Now we can do it. 
I would like to make a point of particular importance to the matter before us. First of all, this is not a new authority, untested or untried. We have been with it for two-thirds of a century. The Smoot-Hawley Act, in which Congress, line by line, set more than 20,000 tariffs, resulted in an average tariff rate, by the estimate of the International Trade Commission, of 60 percent. The result was ruinous, not only to us, but to our trading partners. The British abandoned their free trade policy and went to empire preferences. The Japanese went to the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. In that year, Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in a free election. Such was the degree of unemployment and seeming despair that the consequences of the First World War would never be over. 
Next came one of the largest trade events of the postwar period, the Kennedy round, which came about because of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. I make the point, sir, that there were persons at that time, as now, concerned about the impact of expanding trade on American workers and American firms. As a condition of a Senate vote on giving the President the power to negotiate what became the Kennedy round--it was named for the President who began it--we had to negotiate a separate agreement, the Long-Term Cotton Textile Agreement, and three persons were sent to do this negotiation: W. Michael Blumenthal, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State; Hickman Price, Jr., an Assistant Secretary of Commerce; and myself, then an Assistant Secretary of Labor. We negotiated to limit surges of imports that might come about from drops in tariffs. It was meant to be a 5-year matter, as I recall. That was 35 years ago, and it's still in place. It was succeeded by the Multi-Fiber Agreement. We have not been unattending to the needs of our workers in these matters. To the contrary. We began Trade Adjustment Assistance in the 1970's. We have more Trade Adjustment Assistance in this legislation. We negotiate these matters with the interests of the American worker in mind, and the evidence is the standard of living we have achieved in this country, of which there is no equal. 
With that point, sir, I would like to call attention to a very special issue. We are asked by some to include in this legislation a requirement that trade agreements include provisions, in effect, statutory requirements, concerning labor and the environment. At first, it seems a good idea. Why not? But let me tell you why not, and if I can just presume on age at this point, which is getting to be a factor in my perspective. I have been there and it doesn't happen, it doesn't work. 
If you go to a developing country and say to them, `We would like to enter into a trade arrangement whereby you will reduce your tariffs and barriers--non-tariff barriers--we will do the same, so we can have more trade,' and at the same time, in the same setting, say, `We want you to adopt higher environmental standards and higher labor standards,' right or wrong, the negotiating partners will say, `Oh, you want us to lower our tariff barriers and raise our costs.' Well, they won't do it. `You are asking that we be put at a double disadvantage. We put those tariffs in to protect ourselves against you, and our environmental and labor standards are those of a developing nation. Now you want to put us at a double disadvantage.' It won't happen. There will be no such agreements. 
I can speak to this. I was Ambassador to India when our trade was at a very, very low level. The great anxiety of the Government of India was that we would somehow use trade in a way that would disrupt their internal affairs, which was never our intention, but it was a perception, and will be even more so now. That is why I point to the serendipity, if you would like, of the provisions in this bill. I made the point that the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act--the original one--was enacted in 1934, and the United States joined the International Labor Organization in 1934--a measure of great importance at that time. President Roosevelt was 
very firmly in favor of it, and Frances Perkins--and I talked to her about it--thought it was one of the central initiatives. They saw it as parallel to trade--parallel. 
Over the years, the International Labor Organization has developed a series of what are called the ILO Core Human Rights Conventions. There are a great many important conventions, but they tend to be on technical matters. These go right to the rights of working people. And there are not many. They are the Forced Labor Convention of 1930; Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize Convention of 1948; Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining Convention of 1949; Equal Remuneration Convention, equal pay for men and women, of 1951; Abolition of Forced Labor Convention of 1957. 
In 1991, I stood on the floor of this Senate, with Claiborne Pell, then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and we called that up, and it passed the U.S. Senate unanimously. It is our law now because we chose to make it our law. We passed it. It is a treaty and we passed it as such. And then there was the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention of 1958, and the Minimum Age Convention--a child labor convention--of 1973. 
Now, in this bill before you is an extraordinary initiative. We fought for an initiative by the United States to promote respect for workers' rights by seeking to establish in the International Labor Organization a mechanism for the systematic examination of and reporting on the extent to which ILO members promote and enforce the freedom of a subsidization, the right to organize and bargain collectively, prohibition on the use of forced labor, prohibition on exploitive child labor, and a prohibition on discrimination in employment. 
We have never before made such a proposal. It has enormous possibilities. The ILO is the oldest of our international organizations. But it comes from an era when the idea of sending inspectors into a country to see whether that country was keeping an agreement would have been thought much too radical. That all changed in the aftermath of World War II. 
Just this moment, we are going through something of a crisis with Iraq over the right of American members of the inspection team from the International Atomic Energy Agency to look into Iraqi production of nuclear power and the possibility of nuclear weapons. That begins with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is part of the United Nations system. You send inspectors in to see what they are doing. It is now a common practice over a whole range of international concerns. 
What we propose is that the International Labor Organization bundle, if you like, the core labor standards, and then set about an inspection system, to see to it how China is doing on prison labor, or child labor, or how the United States is doing--we will be looked into, too--and how countries around the world have done. Now, this will take energy. I would like to think that, somewhere in the executive branch, someone is listening to this debate because these measures were proposed by the President. But it takes energy in the executive to get this done. Come to think of it, Alexander Hamilton's definition of good government was `energy in the executive.' 
I would like to think that our Trade Representative, our Department of Labor, our Department of Commerce, will be actively involved. I say the Department of Commerce because business is involved. The ILO is a tripartite group. Business has a vote, the U.S. Council for International Business, as does the AFL-CIO. They each have a vote, and the U.S. Government has two votes. This is a business-labor enterprise. We have been involved with it for a very long time. Herbert Hoover, as Secretary of Commerce under President Harding, sent delegates to the ILO conference in Geneva from the Chamber of Commerce and from the AFL-CIO. So we are addressing concerns about the environment and labor standards in their proper context and setting. If you want them, you have to do it there. 
If you only want not to have more open trade, you can try it in negotiations. But Mr. President, it won't work. The trading partners just will not agree. And if you want to take the time to find it out, very well, but for the moment, I think you will find that the overwhelming judgment of economists is that what we have here is a clean measure. That is the way to go. And this is what we now need to do--give the President fast-track authority, which will enable him to enter negotiations that will result in agreements, and with those agreements in place, we will go into the 21st century proud of what we began in the 20th. 
Mr. President, I again thank my chairman for the felicity with which he chose to give the name Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997 to this legislation.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, without further comment, I yield the floor once again with a sense of ebullience. We are going to do this. We kept the faith. We followed the convictions and the experience of Presidents going all the way back to the 1930's. 
So I close simply by quoting again, Senator Dole in his fine op-ed piece in yesterday's Washington Post: 
The decision to give the President fast-track authority is urgent and must be made now. Very simply, passing fast track is the right thing to do. Our Nation's future prosperity, the good jobs that will provide a living for our children and grandchildren, will be created through international trade. Today it is more important than ever that the debate between advocates of free trade and protectionism is over. Global trade is a fact of life rather than a policy position. That is why we cannot cede leadership in developing markets to our competitors through inaction, thereby endangering America's economic future and abandoning our responsibility to lead as the sole remaining superpower. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his courteous attention and I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there is now clear evidence that at least for the short run, both the economy and the budget have attained to a singular degree of stability. 
Consider the following facts: 
The current economic expansion is now in its seventh year and shows no sign of ending; the unemployment rate is below 5 percent for the first time in 24 years; the current official inflation rate, which may be--and almost certainly is--overstated, is about 2 percent; the deficit has been reduced from $290 billion in fiscal year 1992 to $23 billion in fiscal year 1997, or just three-tenths of 1 percent of our gross domestic product; the Congressional Budget Office projects that, under present law, the unified budget will have a surplus of $86 billion in the year 2007. I repeat that unfamiliar phrase--a surplus of $86 billion. The Congressional Budget Office also projects that, under present law, the debt held by the public will fall from about 50 percent of gross domestic product this year to about 30 percent by 2007. 
May I suggest to my colleagues that, for the first time in 20 years or more, such good economic news is upon us and was previously thought unattainable. 
Last week, at a Finance Committee hearing on his confirmation to be Treasury Assistant Secretary of Economic Policy, David Wilcox quoted a favorite economics professor of his at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology--and I have the honor to say, parenthetically, a long and good friend of mine--the distinguished Nobel laureate Robert Solow. As Wilcox recalls, Professor Solow said something as follows. 
. . . the most important thing economists have to communicate to the rest of the world is how effectively markets work. The most important thing that economists have to tell each other is the important ways in which markets sometimes don't work exactly right. 
One need not engage in a long discourse on the fundamental differences between Keynesian and classical macroeconomic theories, to realize that during the last recession and current expansion, the deficit has changed as economists would expect, or in any event would hope. 
Between fiscal 1989 and fiscal 1991, as the economy entered a recession, gross domestic product in nominal--which is to say money terms--grew at an average rate of 4.7 percent. Revenues to the Federal Government, however, only grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent, while outlays grew by 7.6 percent. Now this imbalance between the growth in revenues and outlays--which helped moderate the recession, as we learned through painful experience in the middle of the century--would ordinarily be welcomed were it not for the fact that, in 1989, the Federal Government's deficit was already 3.8 percent of GDP. As it were, the deficit reached 5.5 percent of GDP in 1991 and 1992. 
For the next 2 years, the economy slowly recovered from the recession. And then, in 1993, something extraordinary happened; we passed what I have since acknowledged to be the largest tax increase in history. We also limited the growth in spending. 
The results--quite contrary to those predicted by many who opposed the measure--are truly remarkable. Between 1993 and 1997, GDP increased at an average annual rate of 5.3 percent. Mr. President, that doubles in something like 13 or 14 years. To double your GDP every 14 years, that would quadruple in a generation, which is almost unimaginable. Real gross domestic product--that is adjusting for inflation--increased at an average annual rate of about 3.5 percent, compared to almost no real growth for the period from 1989 to 1991. With rapid, noninflationary growth, revenues increased at an average annual rate of 8.2 percent, while outlays grew at a modest 3.3 percent annual rate. 
For the fiscal year just ended, the comparison is even more striking. The economy grew by 5.9 percent, while revenues grew by 8.7 percent and outlays by a mere 2.7 percent. We have had no such experience in postwar periods. I don't know if we have ever had such an experience. 
Mr. President, may I suggest that while the revenues and outlays grew as one would expect during the various phases of a business cycle, it was only after a very great deal of effort, and not an inconsiderable amount of pain that we have brought the Federal budget into near balance--a deficit of $22.6 billion, a rather insubstantial three-tenths of 1 percent of GDP. 
But, sir, in the closing days of this first session of the 105th Congress, we can risk it all. 
Perhaps we should follow the admonition that Hippocrates bequeathed to the medical profession, which somehow translated it from Greek into Latin, in the passage of the Hippocratic oath: `primum non nocere'--`first do no harm.' 
Tax legislation for this session of the 105th Congress is and should be concluded. 
Mr. President, my remarks till now have focused on the short run and pleasant and unparalleled economic and budget circumstances in which we now find ourselves. But before we devote too much energy to tax cuts in the next session of the 105th Congress, we should be mindful of the following less-than-exuberant facts. 
First, the budget is not yet in surplus. 
Second, the Congressional Budget Office also projects that the deficit is likely to reappear after the year 2007 and that the debt held by the public as a percentage of gross domestic product is likely to increase as the baby boom generation begins to retire. 
Third, without the on-budget surpluses of the Social Security trust funds, the Congressional Budget Office still projects annual deficits of about $100 billion even after the budget is balanced in the year 2002. 
I make the point, Mr. President, as Senator Dole remarked yesterday on `Meet The Press,' in 1983 we made major changes in the Social Security System which have made it solvent and in surplus every year since then and for many years still to come. But that surplus is not saved in any conventional sense of the word; it is expended on other purposes that have nothing to do with social insurance, a matter which I know troubled Senator Dole when he was still our most revered colleague and majority leader. 
And, lastly, projected unified budget surpluses in the short run would rapidly disappear if the current expansion ends and the economy were to enter a recession. 
In that setting, Mr. President, I offer a resolution which I hope to call up at some point in the days remaining in the first session of the 105th Congress to express the sense of the Senate regarding the treatment of any future unified budget surpluses. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, for half of our century--52 years--one of the notable events in the life of New York City has been the annual dinner of the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation, sponsored by the Archdiocese of New York, and presided over by the cardinal archbishop, most recently by His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor. The foundation supports the hospitals of the archdiocese. 
The centerpiece, if you will, of the evening is the dinner speaker. Over the years, truly great men and women of our age have appeared in the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Kings, prime ministers--Winston S. Churchill was the 1947 speaker, in the company of James V. Forrestall--and Presidents or Presidential candidates by the score. It fell to me to write the first draft of Averell Harriman's address when he was Governor of New York; it was, I do believe, a distinction he treasured ever after. And now we have had Buffalo's gift to the Nation, Timothy J. Russert. 
This year the speaker was Timothy J. Russert, Moderator of `Meet The Press,' which, come to think, is celebrating its 50th anniversary just now. Mr. Russert was by turns irreverent and riotous. But his purpose was profoundly serious and, if you will, reverent. It is something Al Smith would very much wish to have had said. We are just now in a phase of considerable self-congratulation about American society. A world away from the slums and factories that Smith, with his Tammany colleagues Robert F. Wagner and James A. Foley, along with Frances Perkins and, of course, Franklin D. Roosevelt helped transform. A world at once vastly improved, and grossly degraded. For in the course of resolving so many difficulties in our public life, we have seen a near-to-incomprehensible collapse in our family lives. As Mr. Russert states: 
At the turn of this century, just three short years from now, there will be seventy million children under the age of eighteen living in the United States. More than a third of them, one in three, nearly twenty-five million, will have been born into single parent households. 
This is the central challenge to American institutions in the generation to come. Doubly so in that Congress and the President have chosen to eliminate the Social Security Act provision for dependent children, a drop-dead date not 4 years away. 
Can anyone imagine Al Smith or his Industrial Commissioner Frances Perkins doing such a thing! One suspects that neither can Mr. Russert, but this is an unnecessary speculation. What is necessary is that his urgent and cogent words be read and absorbed as widely as possible.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, our revered chairman, in calling up this important nomination of Mr. Charles O. Rossotti, spoke at length of the problems we have encountered with the Internal Revenue Service and spoke of the need for public confidence in that agency and the manner in which our tax revenues are collected. 
He spoke of the determination of the Committee on Finance to see that this issue is addressed fully, comprehensively, and carefully. I would like to stand here and say that as this goes forward, there can be complete public confidence in the chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Roth, that it will be done in a nonpartisan way. I don't think I should use the word `bipartisan,' because I don't think there is a Republican method of collecting taxes fairly and efficiently or a Democratic method. It is something that we must do properly as a Nation. 
We do well to remind ourselves that we began as a Nation in protest against taxation we thought was improper and illegal and that this issue has never been far from our concerns, although not until recently has the Committee on Finance exercised its oversight jurisdiction. It is our duty to see what is going on in this large public agency, which was founded in 1862 on the occasion when the Federal Government imposed for the first time an income tax. And which, as the distinguished chairman said, has the organization and pattern of the industrial age, as yet but little responsive to the modes of management which have emerged in a postindustrial age with great efficacy and public response. 
I am here to state that there is complete support on this side of the aisle for the chairman's program. The particulars will emerge as we work at the facts, as we uncover them. We have our first hearing on the IRS restructuring legislation this Wednesday. Again, I will say this is not a bipartisan matter, it is a nonpartisan matter of central importance to the Federal Government. As the chairman indicated in his closing passage, the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service is an important measure of cooperation from the executive branch. The chairman noted that President Clinton has supported this. In particular, Secretary of the Treasury Rubin, much impressed by the work of the commission headed by a member of our committee, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and legislation introduced by him and another Member, Senator Grassley of Iowa, again in an across-the-aisle mode. It was Secretary Rubin who thought that the time had come to bring modern management modes into the IRS and, indeed, Madam President, Mr. Rossotti will be the first Commissioner not to be a tax lawyer in a half century, since World War II. This is not, as Everett Dirksen would have said, to slight the tax lawyers. They typically defend the public, the individuals against the Government, and their task grows steadily more rewarding as the tax code become steadily more incomprehensible. Still, we have brought the right man to do the job at this moment. 
I would like just to offer a brief comment, if I can have the indulgence of the Chair, about an article which appeared in the New York Times, whilst we were contemplating this second phase of the effort which the chairman began with those 3 days of dramatic and powerful testimony. And that is an article by Paul C. Light, a professor of public affairs and political science at the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, in which Professor Light pointed out that whatever we do to restructure and simplify the Tax Code, we still have a problem of organization within the IRS itself. We still have to do something to reduce the multiple layers of bureaucracy which, and I quote Dr. Light, `leaves no one accountable for how agents treat taxpayers.' 
I think you would find this is a normal development of an agency in place over a very long time in which you have career public servants in a system which has gradations of compensation, and presumedly responsibility that go from General Service 3 to General Service 17, and then there are supergrades beyond that. 
You create this in a 19th-century mode. It is called civil service reform. And on this floor a century ago, 110 years ago, it was debated with great vigor. It meant to take the individuals in the public employ out of any area of political influence, political choice, patronage of jobs. 
But it easily results in what Professor Light calls layering--the GS-5 on top of the GS-4, the GS-6 on top of the GS-5. And he gives this illustration, a very concise one. He said:  
Just imagine a bureaucracy that goes something like this: an agent-- 
The agent is the person who deals with the individual citizen-- an agent reports to a district group manager, who reports to a branch chief, who reports to an assistant chief of the division, who reports to the assistant district director, who reports to the assistant regional commissioner, who reports to the regional commissioner, who reports to the chief of staff to a deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the deputy assistant commissioner, who reports to the assistant commissioner, who reports to the chief operating officer, who reports to the deputy commissioner, and so on. 
You haven't even reached the top of the layer. 
That is the kind of progression you will get over a century in an organization in which the internal incentives are to be promoted, as they should be. It is how Colin Powell went from being a member of the Pershing Rifles at City College in New York, where I began my education, to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces. And they encourage them. But there can be too much. It can separate accountability to the point where it cannot be found in the system. 
It has been remarked that the Catholic Church, which has been around for centuries, has managed all these years with just three layers of authority. You have Pope, bishop, and priest. There are some honorific; every so often a priest will be called a monsignor, but it is Pope, bishop, priest. And it is something to be thought about, as this whole subject is considered in the Congress. 
We spend too little time on organizational matters, too little time on how much we have spread out agencies. I have been witness, in my time in Government, to a number of sequences by which the Bureau of Public Roads in the Department of Commerce, a small effective agency known in the 1920's and 1930's for its very vigorous civil service that was mostly working on farmer market roads, and then comes some other legislation, the interstate highway program, and the next thing you know you have the Department of Transportation. 
I have seen small activities in the field of education. We had a commissioner of education, oh, going back a long way, and various able persons ran it. It was in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. And don't you know, gradually it spun off and became the Department of Education. And there have been efforts in the other body to put an end to it. But by and large, these efforts are never successful. They take longer than you think. They are not very rewarding. You cannot put them in a newsletter. 
As a matter of fact, we don't have newsletters anymore. I do not want to speak with anything less than the fullest admiration of our colleagues in the House of Representatives, but when I came to this body each Senator had a certain amount of funds--we had the franking privilege, which went back to 1790, and enabled us to write persons, to send out mailings to our constituents. 
For my part, I represent some 18 million people. You cannot meet them, but you can write them. Or rather you could write them. The one thing from that great revolution we had across the way a few years ago is we abolished the one direct contact between Members of the Congress and the citizenry, which was the newsletter. The first one went out from Philadelphia in 1790, a gentleman from North Carolina, as I recall, telling his folks that there was not much going on just then, but he had hopes that there 
might be a tariff change which would improve the sales of our local product. By `our local product' he meant whiskey, corn whiskey, as against rum from the Caribbean. Indeed, it was an important source of revenue. And it kept the settlers across the Appalachians connected to the Atlantic coast as against the Ohio-Mississippi system which took them through French territory at the time. 
We have lost that direct contact. This agency ought not to lose its. I was impressed, if I may say, by Mr. Rossotti's response on this point. We were speaking of these matters during his hearing, and I raised this issue of layering. And afterward he wrote me a letter in which he said--and I will take the liberty of quoting as I do not see any other Senator seeking recognition just now--he said: 
Your comment about the `layering' that accumulates in many large organizations that are organized on traditional lines is getting at a very important point. Excessive layering often lies at the heart of many problems, especially the difficulty upper management faces in understanding accurately what actually goes on in the front lines. It can also slow down action to fix problems. Of course, I do not yet know enough about the specific facts at the IRS to know how this problem affects the IRS and what might be done about it. As I begin my assessment of the situation at the IRS, however, I will most certainly be thinking hard about this issue. 
If I may say, this is a promising response. We have had lots of nominations before our committee in the 21 years that you and I have served there together, sir. And without in any way disparaging any of my predecessors, this is the first evidence I have ever had of any of the nominees listening to anything that we said. Perhaps at most they keep an ear open, thinking that as soon as we stop talking, it is over, and `I can get out of here and on with my job.' 
But to get a letter like that back--well, Mr. Rossotti is a management specialist. He deals with modern systems. He has built an international firm for which people engage him to help them with the kinds of problems we have here. It is a good beginning. 
Now, sir, one last point. The employees of the Internal Revenue Service are well-paid public servants, but none of them makes a third of the salary of an average tax attorney. And the average tax attorney has to master this--what is it?--9,479 pages of the Internal Revenue Service. Look at it--9,479 pages. 
That speaks dereliction of our duty. We can't go on producing these. 
I take the liberty of displaying to the Senate and to our distinguished Presiding Officer the bill we adopted on July 31--820 pages added to the 9,479; 820 pages entitled Taxpayer Relief Act. What taxpayer relief will there be from having the IRS have to understand what is in here, as well as individual taxpayers? We better watch this. It is the way organizations can develop. It is a form of entropy. Energy goes down the system, complexity goes up and abuse takes place. 
We can attend to organizational matters as much as we want. We can certainly attend to abuse. But until we simplify the Tax Code as a multiyear effort, as one that is real, we will fail to address the heart of the problem. Remember the simplifiers that took over on the other side of the Capitol who said we will get rid of all these complexities? What did they do? They added 820 pages. That speaks to a systemic problem, and we are old enough and capable enough as a society to address them. I, for my part, am hugely pleased that we will. 
I want to thank again our chairman, without whom this would not be taking place, and thank Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and thank Secretary Rubin. This is a good beginning and a good note on which to start. I urge the confirmation of Mr. Rossotti, an extraordinarily able man. 
I do not know that political party has ever entered into the calculation of who ought to be the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue, but I do expect that by and large it has been a person who is of the same party as the President who nominates him. It is an interesting fact that this is not the case in this instance. I am sure we will have his cooperation, and I am sure you will know how to use it to the greatest public advantage.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, may I thank my dear chairman for saying there is no time like now. What a better moment to start addressing the Tax Code than that point which, nominally at least, we have a balanced budget and we are not driven by the exigencies of revenue as such. We can address the question of complexity, efficiency, and clarity. 
Simplicity--we are a republic. We are meant to be simple. Good people of Maine would like that, I think, and I think the people of Delaware would. In New York we are somewhat given to complexifying, but I think we might find a little simplicity refreshing. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in an op-ed article in the New York Times on Tuesday, Richard Leone, who is the president of the 20th Century Fund, an eminent New York City institution, remarked, `Last week, the House of Representatives took time out from beating up on the Internal Revenue Service to approve a fresh tax loophole.' 
I have had occasion to comment that on July 31, when we voted 92 to 8 to approve an 820-page addition to the Internal Revenue Code, the only copy of the bill in this Chamber was in the possession of our most distinguished tax counsel, Mr. Giordano. 
Somewhat furtively, Members would come up and ask if they could just check whether their provision was in the bill. We might have charged for that service. We did not, in the public spirit of the occasion. But it was no way to legislate taxation. 
In that spirit, I simply want to say that neither, at this time and in this manner, ought we to be approving a new provision providing for expansion of IRA's that would cost us $4 billion over 10 years. That is in addition to the $38 billion in new IRA's which we passed on July 31. There was an education IRA, and I am happy to say a Roth IRA. Our distinguished chairman is to have the satisfaction, I hope it is, of seeing in bank windows around the country, `Roth IRA available for purchase,' which people will be wise to do. 
The tax legislation for this session of the 105th Congress is concluded. We will resume next year. I hope we don't resume with too much energy. It is a fact that we impose upon the Internal Revenue Service, and upon the citizenry much more than the Internal Revenue Service, incredibly complex measures which defy assessment in so many cases. And we do it while calling for the repeal of the Internal Revenue Code and the abolition of the IRS. Well, I can understand the calls that issue from the House of Representatives to abolish the IRS, because increasingly its task is impossible. But on the other hand, there is something called the Nation and it does require revenues. Even if they are reduced to that elemental proposition of delivering the mail and defending the coasts, that does require revenues. The choices are for us many and we shouldn't complexify them to the point of plain bafflement. 
The President has said he will veto this bill. Our President, in a letter to our distinguished majority leader of July 29, thanked the majority leader and, by reference, the others of us in conference on the Tax Relief Act of 1997, for the bipartisan way in which we were putting that legislation together, but he did say he would strongly oppose the measure of the Senator from Georgia. So, accordingly, that was taken out in conference in order for the whole bill to be approved.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair. 
One further point. After a very great deal of effort and not inconsiderable amount of pain, we have brought the Federal budget into balance. I stood here in 1993, or rather my good friend, now Ambassador to China, Mr. Sasser, as chairman of the Budget Committee, stood here and I stood there as chairman of the Finance Committee, and in a very close and dramatic moment, we got the required 51 votes to enact what I have since acknowledged to be the largest tax increase in history. But it broke the back of the expectation that we could never handle our finances, that interest rates had to be high, the inflation premium attendant on the probability that we would end up monetizing the debt because we couldn't pay for it. Monetizing is a term by which you inflate the currency and lower the cost of the debt. 
We did it, and the deficit has gone down. We have this most extraordinary, unprecedented, somewhat difficult-to-comprehend situation of full employment, low inflation, low interest rates, high productivity. Fuller employment than we ever thought was compatible with the interest situation. We are in a new economic setting, and by March, I would think, the continued revenues to the Treasury would be such that the deficit will have disappeared. 
We have talked about the deficit, not always in the calmest tones, for a decade now. We finally balanced the budget, and what do we suddenly see? More and more proposals for cutting taxes through one form or another, losing revenue so we will get the deficit back again. 
Mr. President, the time is at hand, if I may say, to use the deficit to reduce the debt. We now spend almost as much money on interest payments as we do on defense. That is not a proportionate set of values of interests, of priorities. We ought to start reducing the debt. For every dollar of public debt that we reduce, we get $1 of private savings, private investment, which, in turn, will produce revenue, and on one hand, it will reduce costs of interest payments, and on the other hand, it will increase revenue. We are short of savings. I know the concern of the Senator from Georgia is savings, but at this moment, I would like to say we will take this up next year. This has not been referred to the Finance Committee. It is a House measure held at the desk in the last hours of the first session of the 105th Congress. I hope that we will put it off until next year when it will receive a goodly consideration. I can't say I know this to be Chairman Roth's intention, but I cannot doubt it is his intention, such as it is his manner in all these issues. 
But to say again, the measure before us would spend $4 billion over 10 years to increase the contribution limit for education IRA's from $500 to $2,500 per year, provide for tax-free build-up of the earnings in such accounts, and tax-free withdrawals for an array of expenses relating to elementary and secondary education. The bill comes to this floor directly from the House; it has not been considered by the Finance Committee. 
With great respect to the sponsor of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Georgia, I do not believe the Senate should take up this legislation at this time. It was just 3 months ago that we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which included a net tax cut of $95 billion over 5 years and $275 billion over 10 years. At a cost of $38 billion over 10 years, that act created the education IRA and the Roth IRA, and significantly expanded existing IRA's and the tax benefits of State-sponsored prepaid college tuition plans. And now, we are asked to expand those recent IRA changes even further. 
As well intentioned as this legislation is, surely there are many other priorities that should take precedence if we are serious about doing something for education. Priorities that have been thoroughly considered in the Finance Committee and by the full Senate. One such priority is the income exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, which is Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. It is probably the single-most successful tax incentive for education we have. In the tax bill that emerged from the Finance Committee in June, we made section 127 permanent and we applied it to graduate school. Unfortunately, when the tax bill came back from conference, this provision was limited to a 3-year extension only for undergraduates. 
Proponents of the pending legislation speak of a crisis in our elementary and secondary schools. There is no more compelling illustration of this than the state of the infrastructure of these schools. During the debate last summer on the tax and spending legislation, Senators Carol Moseley-Braun and Bob Graham brought the issue of crumbling schools to our attention, and they continue to be eager to address it. If we feel we must spend $4 billion, why not spend it to insure that schools have heat this winter? 
There are also tax policy concerns with this bill. First, complexity. Even as we hear ever louder calls to scrap the code, we have before us a bill that would create a maze of rules in attempting to define what constitutes a `qualified elementary and secondary education expense.' The bill states that qualified elementary and secondary school expenses include expenses for tuition, computers, and transportation required for enrollment or attendance at a K-12 institution, and for home schooling. There is no further definition. For example, would it be possible to withdraw money from these accounts to purchase the family car? I don't know, but you can't find the answer in the text of this bill. 
Under the bill, the ability to contribute funds for elementary and secondary education expenses is proposed to sunset after 2002. However, money contributed through 2002 could still be used for such expenses. It will be up to the taxpayer to track--and the IRS to examine--when funds were contributed, and whether they can be used for only elementary and secondary education, only higher education, or both. 
The administration estimates that 70 percent of the benefits of the bill go to the top 20 percent of income earners, taxpayers with annual incomes above $93,000. Tax benefits to taxpayers below that level are estimated to be nominal. If the proponents are truly concerned about the middle class, the tax benefits should be targeted there. In order to accomplish this, the income limits that apply to this bill would have to be lowered, and the ability to circumvent those limits would have to be prevented. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the good will of the sponsors of this legislation, which we will be happy to consider in the Finance Committee in the next season. But please let us not take up a tax bill, of all things, in the final days of this session. This is no time for this tax bill or any other tax bill. But if our friends in the majority insist on going forward, I believe they will find that Senators on this side--and doubtless on their side, too--will be ready with amendments by the dozens. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
I thank the Chair for his courtesy, and I thank my friend.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, in a few moments the Senate will vote to confirm a most able candidate for U.S. District Judge for the Western District of New York. Charles Joseph Siragusa was western New York's most experienced prosecutor who became its most admired supreme court judge. We now have the opportunity to bring his considerable talents to the Federal bench. 
I had the honor of recommending Judge Siragusa to President Clinton on May 14, 1997. He enjoys the full support of my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, and the unanimous approval of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Might I note that my judicial screening panel interviewed more than 20 applicants to fill the vacancy that resulted when Judge Michael A. Telesca took senior status. There were, as one might have expected, many splendid candidates. However, Judge Charles J. Siragusa stood out. 
Judge Siragusa has served with great distinction in the Seventh Judicial District. He was elected to the State supreme court in 1992, following 15 years as a prosecutor with the Monroe County district attorney's office. In that capacity he tried over 100 felonies and was involved in a number of significant criminal cases including the prosecution of Arthur J. Shawcross, a serial killer responsible for the deaths of 11 women. He received widespread recognition and praise for his work on that case. 
A native of Rochester, Judge Siragusa was graduated from LeMoyne College in DeWitt, NY, in 1969. He received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1976 and has been a member of the New York State Bar since 1977. 
Judge Charles J. Siragusa is a man of great intelligence and unwavering principle. I am confident that, upon confirmation, he will serve with honor and distinction.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would very much like to thank the senior Senator from Alaska, the Chairman, for the graciousness with which he has yielded to me. I will not take long. 
I want to acknowledge that I am a cosponsor of this legislation. And in the interest of full disclosure, I will say there are two small projects in New York State that would be affected. But the proposition to be addressed once again, as the senior Senator from West Virginia has said, is that the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional, and we are already beginning to see the constitutional consequences, the extraordinary increase in the power of the Presidency as against the legislature that is implicit in the newly enhanced bargaining position of the President. 
If you want to change this power, which is very carefully set forth in article I of the Constitution, then amend the Constitution. But, Senators, listen to Senator Byrd. Listen, if I might just presume to say, to Justice John Paul Stevens. In the course of our challenge, which reached the Supreme Court last June, the Justices simply said, well, they don't have standing. However, in a powerful dissent, Justice Stevens, who was the only Justice to comment directly on the merits of the case, said they surely do have standing. He wrote of the Act: 
If the procedure were valid, it would deny every Senator and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the President's cancellation authority. Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it clear that the persons who are deprived of that right by the Act have standing to challenge its constitutionality. Moreover, because the impairment of that constitutional right has an immediate impact on their official powers, in my judgment they need not wait until after the President has exercised his cancellation authority to bring suit. Finally, the same reason that the respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional. 
Again, Justice Stevens said, not only do they have standing but the measure is unconstitutional. Two Federal judges have spoken to this issue: Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia--who took just 3 weeks from having heard the case to declare it unconstitutional--and then Justice Stevens. 
I can report that three new constitutional challenges have recently been filed and now consolidated, I believe is the term, in the District Court, and we will hear from the Supreme Court before this term is out, I should think. 
But in the first instance remember that the large issue here is that of the Constitution. We take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I had never thought, Mr. President, when I first took that oath that there were any `domestic' enemies to the Constitution, but now as I look about us, I recall that celebrated immortal line from Pogo: `We have met the enemy and he is us.' 
Now, there will be time to overcome that. For the moment I simply wish to thank the Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman, for an opportunity to express my view on this subject. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on October 16, following the release of monthly price data by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], the Social Security Administration announced a 2.1-percent cost of living adjustment [COLA] for Social Security and other Government programs. Yet a week earlier, the Social Security Administration circulated a table which indicated that the benefit increase would be 2.7 percent. 
How could this happen? Simple. The Administration, as I have noted on numerous occasions, insisted on using an outdated economic forecast so as to obscure the fact that the budget was approaching balance in fiscal year 1997 in the absence of a budget agreement. While that budget legislation was pending in Congress last summer, it was feared that if the economic outlook was too favorable, pressure for the budget bills would decrease and agreement would not be reached. And so the Social Security Actuaries had no recourse other than to use the official forecast when presenting data on the actuarial status of the trust funds. 
Here is why the numbers were, to put it mildly, misleading. The Administration notes that its midsession budget review--released almost 2 months late on September 5--is based on economic projections finalized in early June. But even by then it should have been clear what was happening to prices. By early June 1997, data for 8 months of the benefit computation period, August 1996-April 1997, indicated that, on an annual basis, CPI-W had increased by 2.4 percent. To increase by 2.7 percent for the full year would require, on an annual basis, a 3.2-percent increase in CPI-W for the remaining 4 months, April 1997-August 1997, of the computation period. Put another way the Administration was predicting a one-third increase in the inflation rate. Yet, on an annual basis, CPI-W increased by only 1.5 percent during these 4 months. That is, the inflation rate actually declined by almost 40 percent. 
In short, by the spring it should have been clear that the benefit increase would be less than 2.7 percent. And by late summer it was virtually certain that the increase would be 2.0 to 2.2 percent, but nowhere near 2.7 percent. 
What does this mean to the average beneficiary now receiving a monthly benefit of $749? Instead of a $20 monthly benefit increase--2.7 percent of $749--the benefit increase will be about $16. Fortunately, few if any Members of Congress rushed out in early October and announced to constituents, based on the Administration's estimates, that they would receive an expected 2.7-percent benefit increase. 
The Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index--the Boskin Commission--concluded that the Consumer Price Index [CPI] overstates changes in the cost of living by about 1.1 percentage points. And many other researchers concur with the findings of the Boskin Commission. The American Association of Retired Persons [AARP], and others, have argued that the only way to keep politics out of the process is to let the BLS do it. Such critics should be mindful that accurate statistics include timely and accurate projections. By late September or early October of each year Social Security beneficiaries should be able to rely on their Government to provide reliable projections of upcoming benefit increases.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is again an honor and a privilege to join with one of the great constitutionalists in the history of the U.S. Senate, Robert C. Byrd, who has written the history of the Senate. 
I can so well remember the occasion on which that great volume was introduced. One of our finest American historians was present saying that it is difficult to understand and very hard to forgive that there has been so little scholarly attention given to this body, to the Congress, as against the Presidency, and suggesting that it is not hard to explain. There is only one President, and there are 435 of us--a more complicated subject that comes later in our historymaking. 
But I think it may be said that in the history of relations between the Congress and the Presidency there has never been an issue equal in importance to the constitutional challenge we face with the Line-Item Veto Act. 
I think of difficulties in the past. There have been clashes between the Executive and the legislative. There are meant to be, sir, I presume to tell you. 
Madison and Hamilton, when they explained the Constitution to the people of New York in that series of essays that became the Federalist Papers, said citizens might well ask. At that time people knew the history of classical Greece and Rome, and they knew how turbulent it was. Madison had the solicitous phrase of speaking of the `fugitive existence' of those republics. And they asked: What makes anyone suppose that we will have a better understanding, a better, a more durable existence than those of the past? And the answer was, `We have a new science of politics.' That was their phrase, ` * * * a new science of politics.' Because in the past, theories of government depended on virtue in rulers. We have made up a different arrangement, an arrangement by which the opposing forces, the checks and balances, set off one group against another. And the result is that in the end you have outcomes that make up for--again, a wonderful line of Madison's--`the defect of better motives.' And, in that regard the Framers very carefully defined in article I and article II this distinction. 
If I may say, again because it is so important, the framers of the Constitution presumed conflict. They did not assume harmony. They did not assume common interests. They assumed conflict. When they were asked, Why should we expect this Republic to survive given the `fugitive existence' of republics of classical Rome and Greece?, they replied `Because we have a new science of politics.' We can have one interest balance another interest. And they devised it because they knew there were conflicting interests. 
I believe it would surprise us, Mr. President, to know the extent to which--until the American Constitution came along--political theory assumed virtue and harmony in rulers and in government. We have seen it in our time, sir, in its most notorious form in the dictatorships of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, in the Republic of China, now in North Korea, if you like. The dictatorship of the proletariat is a wonderful way of saying rule by the virtuists, and rule by the virtuists turned out in reality to be rule by tyrants, by monsters. Indeed, Mr. Pol Pot is just now being interviewed by Mr. Thayer in the Far Eastern Review, 
and in the name of virtue, in the name of the people's republic, Mr. Pol Pot murdered perhaps as many as 2 million Cambodians. All in the name of virtue. 
Well, this Constitution does not assume virtue. It assumes self-interest. And it carefully balances the power by which one interest will offset another interest and in the outcome make up, again in that wonderful phrase of Madison, `the defect of better motives.' 
In the judgment of this Senator, shared of course by our revered leader in this regard, nothing could violate that constitutional design more clearly than the Line Item Veto Act. On January 2 of this year, the first business day after the Line Item Veto Act took effect, I joined Senator Byrd, Senator Levin, and our never-to-be-forgotten friend from the State of Oregon, the former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of that Act on the ground that it violates article I, section 7, clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, known as the presentment clause. 
Mr. President, the issue of this Act's constitutionality has now been commented upon by two Federal judges. In the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson took exactly 3 weeks from the date of oral argument to conclude that it is unconstitutional. He wrote in his April 10, 1997 opinion that by passing the Line Item Veto Act, `Congress has turned the constitutional division of responsibilities for legislating on its head.' 
The Justice Department appealed that decision, and we went to the Supreme Court where, in a manner that I think is generally understood, the Court is a little shy about getting into arguments between Members of Congress and the President. I could use the image, sir, that the Court likes to see someone before it with a broken arm saying, let me tell you how it happened to me and why. And they held that we did not have standing--seven Justices did. Justice Breyer thought we had standing. But most importantly, sir, Justice Stevens dissented. He said we did have standing, and what is more, that this measure is unconstitutional. He is the one Supreme Court Justice who has commented on the question of this statute's constitutionality. In his opinion he wrote:  
The same reason that the respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional. 
I quote, Sir, from the case of Franklin D. Raines, Director, Office of Management and Budget, et al., Appellants, versus Robert C. Byrd, et al. 
Now, this is a constitutional question. There is another more subtle one. It goes directly to the constitutional intention of the separation of powers and the balance of powers, and that is the idea of the shift in power from the Congress to the executive that this legislation makes possible. 
In this morning's Washington Post there is an article about the President's recent exercise of this authority. And rather to my distress, if I may say it, a number of Senators on this floor and a number of Members on the House floor have discovered that there is politics being played in the White House. Politics, Mr. President? I am shocked to hear that there are politics in the Presidency. Of course, there are--ever have been. In today's story in the Post a very distinguished scholar, Stanley E. Collender, who is an expert on spending issues, says, `The line-item veto is never going to be a deficit reduction tool and you would think they'--the Congress--`would have realized it when they gave it to the President. It's a raw exercise in power.' Mr. President, if you want to shift power from the Congress to the executive, fine. Amend the Constitution. Do not abuse it by statute. And if it came to amending it, I am not sure we would. 
I talked earlier about the `Federalist,' which was written as essays in New York State newspapers in support of ratification by New York State of the Constitution, which was a very close matter. 
Rhode Island, as the distinguished sometime President pro tempore knows, was the last to ratify it. It took them years. But they didn't have Madison and Hamilton and Jay to read at the time, and we did. 
Now, there has just appeared a wonderful small volume called the New Federalist Papers, a twentieth century fund book written by Alan Brinkley, Nelson Polsby and Kathleen Sullivan. They try to make their essays about the length of the original Federalist. Nelson Polsby has a succinct and devastating essay on the line-item veto. 
Nelson Polsby, who happens to be a friend of many years, is Professor of Government at the University of California, Berkeley, and his many books include, most importantly in my view, his book `Congress and the Presidency.' And he writes here on the line item veto. He says: 
The line-item veto would make Congress severely dependent on Presidential good will. A shrewd President would not veto everything but would use the line-item veto selectively, in effect bribing legislators into cooperating. Americans have a stake in preserving the independent judgment of Congress on issues of public policy. This is not the way to do it. 
`Americans,' I say again, `have a stake in preserving the independent judgment of Congress on issues of public policy. This is not the way to do it.' 
I should say that Mark Hatfield, our coplaintiff, is using this text in his seminars back in Oregon just now. 
Early on in our deliberations--and I hope I will not take any liberty when I say it--a most distinguished and admired colleague, `Mac' Mathias, a Senator from Maryland, who was with us so long, when this first came up commented from his long experience, `The President won't veto any great number of items. He will just let it be known that he can.' And the conversation goes as follows: Senator, I know how much this radiation laboratory means to that fine hospital you have worked so hard to develop. I know how much it means to the health of the American people, to science, to medicine. But, you know, Senator, expanding NATO is a very important issue to me. And I hope that if I understand your needs, and I feel your needs, you will understand mine, and surely you will. Can we have that understanding as responsible persons in Government? 
Well, that kind of trading goes on and is meant to go on. That's what checks and balances are about. But not with the threat of an unconstitutional act to change a bill passed by this body and the other body and sent to the President, take something out of it, and the bill that in consequence never passed either body becomes law. That violates the Constitution's `single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure,' as the Court in INS versus Chadha called the presentment clause of article I. 
Now if you want to do that, fine. Amend the Constitution. But you cannot amend the Constitution by statute. 
I do not want to go on because there are so many distinguished persons in the Chamber, and the Senator from West Virginia, our teacher in these matters, is being very patient. But simply to say, as Mr. Collender says in this morning's Washington Post, this will never save any money. What will happen is, as Mr. Polsby says in his essay, it simply shifts power from the legislative branch to the executive branch. And it does so in a manner that Justice Stevens in the Supreme Court not 4 months ago said is unconstitutional. More I do not know what need be said. The Congress could do itself a great service by passing Senator Byrd's legislation. Then we would have a real test of political reality. Would that bill be signed or vetoed? We do not know, but one good way to find out is simply to adopt this direct and simple legislation.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I might reply to my distinguished friend and chairman who asked, `Who has agreed? If we assert this is unconstitutional, who has agreed?' May I just read a passage from the opinion of the one Justice of the Supreme Court who has commented on the constitutionality question? It was John Paul Stevens, 26 June, 1997. Our complaint had been filed on January 2, the first business day of this year after the act took effect. He says: 
The line-item veto purports to establish a procedure for the creation of laws that are truncated versions of bills that have been passed by the Congress and presented to the President for signature. If the procedure were valid, it would deny every Senator and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the President's cancellation authority. Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it clear that the persons who are deprived of that right by the act [meaning the plaintiffs] have standing to challenge its constitutionality. 
Moreover, because the impairment of that constitutional right has an immediate impact on their official powers, in my judgment they need not wait until after the President has exercised his cancellation authority to bring suit. 
Finally, the same reason that the respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional. 
Now, on October 16 of this year--this month--the city of New York filed suit with respect to a vetoed item in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. New York City was joined by the Greater New York Hospital Association and two labor groups that represent hospital workers. I have asked to file an amicus brief. The case is now pending in the district court and we will hear presently from them.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I respond to my learned and good friend, there are no judicial pronouncements to the effect that this is constitutional, for the simple reason that it is rather new. It was enacted by Congress for the first time in 1996. But although it has never been adjudicated by the courts, it has been the subject of scholarly commentary. At the time we debated the measure in the Senate, I cited several such scholarly opinions, including those of Lawrence H. Tribe of the Harvard Law School, and Michael J. Gerhardt, then of the Cornell Law School, now dean of Case Western Reserve Law School. I noted that in Professor Tribe's treatise `American Constitutional Law,' he writes: 
Empowering the President to veto appropriation bills line by line would profoundly alter the Constitution's balance of power. The President would be free, not only to nullify new Congressional spending initiatives and priorities, but to wipe out previously enacted programs that receive their funding through the annual appropriations policy. 
He goes on to say: 
Congress, which the Constitution makes the master of the purse, would be demoted to the role of giving fiscal advice that the executive would be free to disregard. The framers granted the President no such special veto over appropriations bills, despite their awareness of the insistence of colonial assemblies that their spending bills could not be amended once they passed the lower house had greatly enhanced the growth of legislative power. 
As the conference report on the Line Item Veto Act came back to the Senate in 1996, we asked Professor Tribe for his opinion, as Senator Byrd will recall. He read the conference report and telephoned in the morning, and he gave us this statement: 
This is a direct attempt to circumvent the constitutional prohibition against legislative vetoes, and its delegation of power to the President clearly fails to meet the requisites of article I, section 7. 
I say to my friend once again, if you want to give the President this power, do so in the mode the Constitution provides. That is by constitutional amendment. But you cannot do it by legislation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the National Security Agency has recently lost to retirement its deputy director, William P. Crowell. As David Kahn has recently written in Newsday, Mr. Crowell has taken NSA and `brought the super-secret spy organization into its public, post-Cold War posture.' For too long, we have been learning our cold war history from Soviet Archives. Bill Crowell set about to change that at the National Security Agency. He directed the establishment of the National Cryptologic Museum, which I have visited and commend to my colleagues, and helped to make public the hugely important VENONA project. 
The VENONA intercepts comprise over 2,000 coded Soviet diplomatic messages between Moscow and its missions in North America. The NSA and its predecessors spent some four decades decoding what should have been an unbreakable Soviet code. Led by Meredith Gardner, these cryptanalysts painstakingly decoded these messages word by word. They would then pass on the decoded messages to the FBI, which conducted extensive investigations to determine the identities of the Soviet agents mentioned in the messages. The resulting VENONA decrypts detail the Soviet espionage effort in the United States during and after the Second World War. 
We need access to much more of this type of information. Not only does VENONA allow us to learn our history, but in releasing it to the public, not insignificant gaps in the government's knowledge of this material are being filled. For instance, the identity of one of the major atomic spies at Los Alamos was recently discovered by clever journalists using the published VENONA messages. Joseph Albright and Marcia Kunstel of Cox News and, working independently, Michael Dobbs of The Washington Post, identified the agent codenamed MLAD as Theodore Alvin Hall, a 19-year-old physicist working at Los Alamos. Hall provided crucial details of the design of the atomic bomb which enabled the Soviet Union to develop a replica of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. 
Bill Crowell recognized the historic value of VENONA and played an important role in getting this material released, along with Dr. John M. Deutch, and with the gentle prodding of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. Mr. Crowell should receive a medal for his work.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise as an original sponsor of the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Technical Corrections Act of 1997. This legislation will extend a provision signed into law as part of the Anti-Terrorism Act (Pub. L. 104-132) allowing individuals who are victims of terrorism and other violations of international law to file suit for damages in United States court. 
The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, enacted in 1976, recognizes that except in the most egregious cases, foreign states are immune from suit by a citizen of the United States. The bill Senator Faircloth and I are introducing today establishes the principle that terrorism, extrajudicial killing, and other gross abuses of human rights are not protected acts of state and are not entitled to sovereign immunity. While the Anti-Terrorism Act expanded the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to allow for suits against countries designated by the Department of State as a sponsor of terrorism, this bill would expand the list of states to include countries which do not have an extradition treaty with the United States, or which do not have an adequate available judicial remedy. This provision recognizes that while foreign states enjoy immunity from most legal action by individuals, there are certain fundamental principles of international law that cannot be violated with impunity. 
Two examples of citizens who would gain legal standing by this legislation are James Smrkovski and Scott Nelson, Americans who were tortured by agents of their foreign state employer, a nation not on the list of terrorist states. They survived harrowing experiences only to be barred by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act from even attempting to obtain redress. When the United States Supreme Court said that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act did not permit Mr. Nelson any legal recourse, it made clear that a remedy must come from Congress. 
And so, Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] and I are introducing this measure so that Americans who have been victims of terrible crimes perpetrated by foreign governments have legal recourse. I urge my colleagues to support and cosponsor the bill, and I hope it can be adopted without undue delay.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise in emphatic support of the nomination of Paul R. Carey of New York to be a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Carey, who has served since 1993 as special assistant to President Clinton, is an inspired public servant who is exceptionally well qualified for this position. 
I have known Paul Carey, boy and man. He was born in Brooklyn, the borough of churches. And indeed it was in a sort of church that we first met. It was in the summer of 1977. I was a newly serving Senator and Paul's father was New York's Governor. It was through Hugh Carey's heroic efforts that New York City was saved from bankruptcy. As I have often said elsewhere, Hugh Carey was New York's greatest Governor since Al Smith. Paul's father and I had gathered, along with several hundred others at Siena College, to be present at the induction of Howard Hubbard to serve as the bishop of the Diocese of Albany. Paul accompanied his father that day. He was still in grade school but he was attentive throughout and his firm handshake alone identified him as his father's son. We became friends and I shared his family's pride as he progressed through high school, graduated from Colgate University, and entered the world of business and finance. 
But I think he was always interested in public service. In 1991 he chanced upon my wife Liz in the Albany train station and said as much. He joined the Clinton administration at the first. And he has just shone. Paul has exemplified what Alexander Hamilton called Energy in the Executive. No bill has been too complex to yield to his explanation. Few Senators are able to withstand his persuasive powers. He has seen the President's program through. Paul has proved his worth and his talents have not escaped the President's notice. 
If I may say Mr. President, Paul's time in the White House will serve him well at the SEC. For despite being an independent agency, the Commission is withal a part of the national government. As such, it is useful to have a Commissioner who knows intimately the workings of the legislative and executive branches. Government has been called the art of the possible. Paul has over these last years learned what is possible and what is not. As the Commission confronts a world made more complex by technology and the globalization of finance, proposals will be made for regulations and laws of great sweep and broad scope. Having a Commissioner who knows what can be done as well as what should be done will allow the Commission to better serve us all. 
Mr. President, I do not believe there is any representative of the administration who enjoys a higher degree of respect on Capitol Hill than Paul Carey, as was demonstrated by the unanimous vote in favor of Paul's nomination by the Senate Banking Committee, and by the enthusiastic support of its chairman. Senator D'Amato. 
Mr. President, I urge the Senate to follow suit and confirm the nomination of Paul Carey by a unanimous vote.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Sunday, October 5, I had the good fortune to speak at the Dedication of the new Jerome and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. I speak of good fortune not because I was able to offer some remarks at the dedication of the splendid new pavilion, but because I was able to hear, Dr. Domenick P. Purpura, dean of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, remind us all of the lasting significance of the American academic medical center. 
With eloquence, humor and a New Yorker's flair, Dr. Purpura reaffirmed my belief that our core values demand our dedication to, and will provide for the future of, academic medical centers. He stated from the outset: 
We are here . . . to dispel the septic rumor oozing from some health policy think tanks to the effect that academic medical centers such as ours are dinosaurs doomed to extinction by the impact of the asteroid of managed care. Look skyward! On this day of noble purpose the sun shines brightly. No ashen clouds obscure the values that have made American medicine a crowning achievement of Western Civilization. And what are these core values? Simply stated: Faith in evidence-based medicine and trust that our superbly trained physicians will translate the basic science of medicine into the art and science of patient care. These values constitute the concrete foundation upon which the three pillars of our academic medical center rests so securely. 
As the good Doctor said, these hospitals are not doomed to extinction by managed care, but rather destined for continued success due to our faith, and their proven achievement, thus far. 
Thirty-two years ago, in the first article of the first issue of the Public Interest, I published some observations on the `Professionalization of Reform.' The essay began with a passage from Wesley C. Mitchell, who had been for near quarter a century (1920-45) director of research at the National Bureau of Economic Research, then based at Columbia University. 
Our best hope for the future lies in the extension to social organization of the methods that we already employ in our most progressive fields of effort. In science and in industry . . . we cannot wait for catastrophe to force new ways upon us . . . We rely, and with success, upon quantitative analysis to point the way; and we advance because we are constantly improving and applying such analysis. 
In the proven field of medicine, the burden of improving and applying analytical methods falls on the academic medical center. Indeed, we cannot forget their influence on the state of medicine today--what Dr. Purpura called, the crowning achievement of western civilization. 
Dr. Purpora reformulated Albert Einstein's e=mc 2 to be `e, excellence [of the medical center] to be equal to m, motivation times c, commitment . . . and the square be the multiple rather than the addition of our joint commitment to excellence in patient care.' Catastrophe will occur not because of `the asteroid of managed care,' but rather due to a decline in either the motivation of Doctors like Dominick Purpura or society's commitment to institutions like the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works for nigh on to 21 years now, I rise with a great sense of pleasure and even pride at what our committee has done in the legislation before you, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, known informally as ISTEA II. It is a work of great complexity, yet clarity of principle. It is a tribute to our chairman, Senator Chafee, to his distinguished and wholly informed, carefully attentive ranking member, Senator Max Baucus of Montana. One would not wish to overlook the work of Senator John Warner of Virginia, whose subcommittee had to produce this measure. Nine months ago--and this might be an augury for many of the matters that remain for the Senate in this session--9 months ago it was thought that this bill would bring about some of the fiercest interregional battles of this time in our national life. And, yet, to the amazement of all and to the very great credit of the managers of the bill, it was reported out of committee unanimously. The committee has a long-standing tradition of bipartisanship, which is always challenged when the elemental and legitimate interests of different regions, and different States, come into play. It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that the authors of the bill chose to give it the same name, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which we gave to the bill in 1991, ISTEA I, if you like. 
Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, then chairman of the House Public Works Committee and a public servant of the highest capacity, and I, as the person charged with the task in the Committee on Environment and Public Works, developed principles for the first highway bill to mark the post-Interstate era. And here I would like to make a point to which I will return at the conclusion of my remarks 
The point is, Mr. President, that the Department of Transportation in 1990-91 faced the unavoidable fact that the Interstate and Defense Highway System, the Eisenhower Interstate System, as it was named at the behest of our beloved John Heinz, was finished. It was built, and they could think of no other thing, no better move, no different task, than to build another. 
I think the distinguished managers will recall, as I will not forget, the occasion on which we were summoned to an event in the auditorium at the Executive Office Building. President Bush came, and stood on the stage by a great map of the United States with white background and red lines, just moving here and there, up and down, right, left. I thought, `Oh, my Heaven, is this the new interstate map?' However, I was reassured finally by the then Secretary of Transportation, that no, these were just illustrative lines drawn, presumptively for aesthetic effect, as might be an abstract expressionist painting exhibited in New York's Museum of Modern Art in the 1980's. They had no idea what to do and had no instinct, save to go on doing what they had done. 
Congress thought differently. Congress chose, in a cooperative mode, to devise the first post-Interstate era transportation program for the country. 
The Interstate System was a long time in the making, Mr. President. It began as a concept at the 1939 World's Fair. I may be one of the only Members of the body who went to that fair, which was in Flushing Meadows in Queens, NY. The General Motors Co., had an exhibit which was the great sensation and joy of the fair. It was called `Futurama.' 
Under a great plexidome, it showed a map of a portion of the United States with Chevrolets and Buicks driving steadily through these great divided highways with cloverleaf intersections, passing through mountains, stopping, in one instance, at the 40th floor, as I recall, of the Empire State Building. It was just a huge success as displays go. 
In 1944, President Roosevelt, having in mind the possibility that the Depression of the 1930's would return at the end of the Second World War--this was a widely held belief--had Congress authorize an interstate highway system to be built when the war was over and peace resumed. 
This was done. The Interstate System was authorized. No funds were made available. Then President Eisenhower came to office. One of the current ideas was the creation of an Interstate system. He appointed a commission to look into it, because this had a particular hold on his personal experience. 
His first command in 1919 had been to assume that enemy action had destroyed the national railroad system, and he was to take a convoy of military trucks from Fort Meade, on the outskirts of Washington, to the Presidio in California. He got there, but it was a tale to tell, and he would tell it. It is a wonderful passage in a book he put out, `Stories I Like To Tell.' 
He crossed the Mississippi River to the Pacific. He averaged about 4 miles an hour. That wouldn't do if, indeed, there was a military emergency. And so the Interstate System became the Interstate Defense System. A dedicated gasoline tax was imposed--this was very much the work of Jim Wright of Texas--and we began the largest engineering public works project in the history of the world. 
Indeed, we had already begun it in New York State where Governor Dewey, in 1946, simply took it upon himself to build such a road with funding from the sales of bonds. He built this road from the outskirts of New York City across the path of the New York Central Railroad and the Erie Canal to Buffalo and down to 
Pennsylvania. It is called the New York State Thruway. And the inspired civil engineer who built it, Bertram Tallamy, was asked down by the Eisenhower administration to take over the small Bureau of Public Roads in the Department of Commerce to build this national system. Previously, the Bureau of Public Roads managed a very small Federal program, mostly involved with what we call farm-to-market roads for rural areas. 
The Interstate System was a vast success, in many ways too much of a success. It changed the outlay of the American economy, the regions, the regional distribution. Cities emptied out, suburbs grew up, factories moved, and a great change took place in our system. The use of automobiles doubled, and then redoubled. The time came, however, when this Interstate System, which really was a misnomer because most of the expanse was in and around cities, was finished and the time had come to do something more. 
The new legislation in 1991 established the principle of a balanced national transportation investment policy, an intermodal policy to improve mobility and access to jobs. Because as jobs left the inner cities all over our country, there was no public transportation available to people who didn't have automobiles. 
It provided for environmental protection. Sometime in the 1970's, we began to notice the phenomenon of air pollution in our cities. A scientist at the University of California identified the process by which smog is formed. Air quality became a genuine and urgent issue. We said we would look at the environment generally and see to it that local communities participated in decisions affecting their environment. 
This, Mr. President, sounds like a routine statement. But before ISTEA, participation by local communities was not a routine event for our National Highway Program. These plans were drawn up in Washington and administered from highway departments in State capitals. Local governments had little or no say. The money, the 90-10 money, the 95-5 money, could scarcely be resisted and decisions were centralized at the State level in a way that would surprise many who began the program. 
If you would like to see an example of devolution, look to what our committee has done in these two bills in moving decisionmaking from the States to regional and local groups. In the hearings that have been held all over the country, there has been, as I understand, very strong endorsement of this legislation on this ground. 
A hearing held at the Alexander Hamilton Custom House in Bowling Green, NY, by Senator Warner brought the Governor of New Jersey, the Governor of New York, the mayor of New York City, persons from the surrounding counties in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York to say this has been a revelation to us that we could have something to say in the expenditure of Federal moneys. Federal funds didn't just have to go for another highway, there was something called efficiency involved. 
We would say in 1991 that there is no such thing as a free lunch and there is no such thing as a free way. We have to introduce pricing principles where the users of the highways pay tolls, varied by hour of the day or night. Electronics could be introduced to efficiently do that. 
At the time of the 1991 legislation, at the Triborough Bridge in New York, which had been opened in time for the 1939 World's Fair, there still were men, now women as well, standing at toll booths collecting tolls. Sixty years had gone by and not a bit of productivity had been introduced into the system. Today, you go through with something called EZ Pass, which electronically collects the toll, and it has quite transformed the system. 
We talked about air quality. We talked about efficiency. We talked about the need to maintain existing infrastructure, and we have been successful. 
The present bill before you, ISTEA II, contains those principles, reasserts them and will continue them. 
The bill does another important thing, and more important to some States than to others. The 1991 legislation provided that States that had built highways that were contributed to the Interstate System would be reimbursed for the expense. This was clearly contemplated by the original authors of the Eisenhower legislation--a committee headed by Gen. Lucius D. Clay. The bill before you continues that principle by including the interstate reimbursement program in the base amounts paid to States under the new formulas. 
This is especially important to New York State, which was authorized to obtain $5 billion over the course of 15 years, and has already received some $600 million. The installments are about a third of a billion each year. 
There are other important problems yet to be resolved. There is an issue of the transit title of our bill. Transit is one aspect of national legislation in which one region will be very much more involved than in others. 
For example, a third of the transit rides in the United States are in the New York region. Yet we receive only 18 percent of the funds, despite having twice that much transit ridership. On balance, we do not get much in the way of flood plain protection. Our agricultural subsidies are minimal. Our defense outlays are almost nonexistent. Transit is one of the key Federal programs that addresses New York's needs. 
We are a big nation, and not every part is exactly like another part. I see the brilliant chairman of our committee has returned. I want to tell him how grateful I am to him. But I say that if the transit formulas in this bill become radically different from those which existed for many, many years, then it will be difficult for any number of us to support the final legislation. This need not happen, and it should not. 
We have a bill here before us from a unanimous committee that can really solidify an enormous and important change. We are talking about transportation policy for the next century. It is not going to be good enough just to go on building those superhighways of this century. 
One of the measures that inspired us in 1991 was a report by a committee that had been established by the State of Florida to look into what would it require to accommodate the automobile traffic from Miami to the Disney complex in northern Florida by the year 2020. The report said it would require 40 lanes of interstate highway. Well, you keep that up and there is nothing left of Florida. You have to do better, and you have to think differently than in the past. Today we must increase innovation and investment in infrastructure, while including the absolutely essential Federal labor protections that are written into law today and have been, in some cases, for 60 years. 
Here, Mr. President, I have one final thing I would like to say. I do not find any pleasure in it, but from time to time such statements are necessary. I am not sure that the Department of Transportation is able to think differently. It is an organization created with one program to administer, and that one program having concluded, it seems incapable of doing anything else. 
As I said at the outset, in 1990, having completed the Interstate System, the only thing the Department of Transportation could think to do, was to build another. In our legislation in 1991, without meaning to be particularly partisan, we provided $725 million to build some prototype magnetic levitation trains and other intelligent transportation systems to get us past the point of a highway automobile driver. 
Magnetic levitation--it is the most important scientific idea in the history of ground transportation since the wheel. It is the first mode of transportation since persons got up on their hind feet, you might say, which does not depend on friction. It is a frictionless mode of ground transportation. The simple principles are magnets which lift a vehicle and moves it as if it 
were flying on the rails. 
The idea, sir, was invented on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, which connects Long Island with the mainland, by a young nuclear engineer, still thriving, working at the Brookhaven Laboratory, who was going back to MIT. As you can do only when you are a nuclear engineer and you are 26 years old, he thought up maglev, between the time he got on the bridge and the time he got off. A colleague patented it the other day. 
I do not assert that it is the necessary new mode of transportation within city regions or in densely populated corridors. But I do say, sir, that they have a train running in Japan now that just broke some new speed records. 
By pure chance, this morning I received an invitation to the opening of the German system this next spring. It was in this morning's mail. I have been on that system. I believe our distinguished chairman has also been there. In Germany, for what it is worth, they have decided to no longer have intracountry air service. They will move by new high-speed technology such as this. 
Sir, in the 6 years since ISTEA, the DOT did nothing, or nothing that I know of--and I will be very pleased to retract these remarks if they are inaccurate--to advance maglev. They pour concrete, or rather they know the contractors that pour the concrete for them. When an institution gets so fixed on one mission that it cannot adapt to a new challenge, to a new time, some of my radical friends in this body, and perhaps most especially in the other body, ought to ask whether that institution is really necessary. Under the legislation as written, this program could be run from an office of perhaps 10 people in the Office of Management and Budget, or what you will. 
In the present legislation, the chairman, the ranking member, and Senator Warner, also said: We will give another try. And $30 million has been provided for the program. And another $920 million is authorized. It could be done. 
We are entitled to hear from the Secretary of Transportation whether he intends to try? Does he have anybody in the employ of the Department who knows what the Congress is proposing? Is there any explanation why no effort was made to spend the money previously provided for maglev? You know, organizations go brain dead, sir, in the history of the world, in the history of governments that cannot adapt to new circumstances. 
I hope that the Department of Transportation would hear what was said. In that first legislation, we wrote at the outset a set of principles about efficiency, adaptability, local involvement, intermodalism because it seemed necessary. It was stipulated in law, black and white law, that these principles should be printed and every member of the Department of Transportation be given a copy. It was stipulated in law, black and white law, that the principles be printed in larger form and posted in every office of the Department. But I wish I could say there has been more of a response. 
I hope I have not done an injustice to individuals in the Department who have tried. But in fact, sir, we have little to show. And that is not good enough. I do not think it is good enough for the managers or for the Congress. They have done their work. Congress will have made this law. It is now for the Executive to see that the law is faithfully executed. 
We have had a good beginning. But we are no way at the conclusion. We are not as far as we had hoped to be, but this continues us in the direction we set out in. I can only once again congratulate the esteemed Senator from Rhode Island, his colleague from Montana, and our colleague from Virginia. They have brought to the Senate floor a bill with the unanimous support of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. What 9 months ago seemed something not possible, surely not probable, has now been done. It is an effort that should be acknowledged, praised and rewarded. 
If I may speak just briefly in the colloquial, there is an old saying which, translated from the Gaelic, says, `If you want an audience, start a fight.' 
Well, yes, true enough. But if you want legislation, find unanimity, find consensus. 
The managers have done this. I just want to congratulate them once more. I know I shall have the opportunity when the final bill comes to the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the most current issue of The Economist has a cover story on the Year 2000 Problem. Entitled the `Millennium Bug Muddle,' the story and editorial describe the global reaction to the computer glitch. While the editors do believe much of the alarmists hue and cry is overstated, they are careful not to minimize the warnings about the critical steps we must take to solve this problem. 
First, even with the lowest estimates of cost at $52 billion, the millennium bug still counts as a serious computing problem, probably the worst to strike the industry to date. Governments and industries must be prepared to pay the bill. Executives and public officials will have to convince the shareholders and taxpayers that they should foot the bill even though the fix will not increase productivity one lick. 
Second, in their research, The Economist authors found that `firms that are a year or so into the repair job say they have learned two things. Had they done nothing, the consequences would have been ugly indeed, from complete failure of their accounting and billing systems to, in the case of some retail firms, an inability to do business at all. But solving the problem is proving relatively straightforward, if time consuming and expensive.' This reaffirms my belief that this is a management problem, NOT a technological problem. 
Third, the article alludes to the impending deluge of litigation. `The results of these unfortunate programming decisions are already appearing. The Produce Palace, a retailer in Michigan, brought the first millennium bug case to court earlier this year, suing the makers of its sales terminals because their terminals cannot handle credit cards that expire after 1999 . . . Meanwhile, Hartford Insurance had to start fixing its systems as far back as 1988, when it realized that its 7-year bonds would crash its software from 1993 onwards.' Our society is extremely litigious. Business interruptions and the ensuing blame game of lawsuits could have lasting harm on our economy and our courts. 
Lastly, as The Economist does so well, the authors see the larger meaning in this problem. They conclude that because we are dependent on technology--and the pragmatic solutions that are devised in technology's evolution--we can be hindered and, in time, stricken, by the unintended consequences of these `innovations.' As they point out, `British railwaymen chose Stephenson's standard gauge over Brunel's wider one in the first half of the 19th Century, as they did in America and most European countries. This standard, originally derived from horse-drawn wagons in British mines, has remained even as railway engineering has undergone 150 years of change. Not surprisingly, it is hopelessly inadequate.' 
But in the end, though costly, the market will compel us to change. The authors write: `Sometimes a standard will be chosen which later turns out to be wrong, (two-digit dates, narrow-gauge railways), but market forces keep the waste in check, and eventually the standard becomes wrong enough to be replaced.' 
What market forces and The Economist authors have failed to address, however, is the lagging response of the U.S. Government to this problem (a relative benchmark, as the United States is ahead of most countries). With just under 800 days left, we cannot have half of our agencies still assessing how many mission critical systems will be affected. This is but the first phase of three--renovation and testing/implementation are the other two. We need an outside body to ensure this problem is fixed. My bill, S. 22, will do just that. 
The good news is that cover stories like that of The Economist will increase awareness, the bad news is that without mention of the status of the Federal Government, the probability of widespread failure will increase.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to note the accomplishments of the International Rescue Committee of New York. 
This week the International Rescue Committee was awarded the Conrad N. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, in recognition of its relief and resettlement services to millions of refugees. In presenting the award to John C. Whitehead, chairman of the IRC Board, former President Jimmy Carter said, `This year, the Hilton Foundation has fulfilled a vital need in bringing the refugee issue, one that is often overlooked or ignored, to the forefront by honoring the International Rescue Committee.' 
The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation created the annual award to recognize outstanding efforts by the best American charitable organization engaged in combating `famine, war, disease, human affliction and man's inhumanity to man.' IRC was selected to receive the award by a prestigious international jury that included Dr. C. Everett Koop, former Surgeon General of the United States. It was accorded the Hilton Prize on the basis of its achievements in alleviating suffering, on the sustainability of its programs, and on the extent to which it reaches out and involves others in accomplishing its mission. 
I want to congratulate the International Rescue Committee on its fine achievements and salute the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation for recognizing those efforts.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Glenn T. Seaborg is a truly great American who for 14 years has suffered outrageous treatment from bureaucrats and is in need of our assistance. Dr. Seaborg, codiscoverer of plutonium, kept a journal whilst chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1961 to 1971. The journal consisted of a diary written at home each evening, correspondence, announcements, minutes, and the like. He was careful about classified matters; nothing was included that could not be made public. Even as he was chairman the portions relating to the Kennedy and Johnson administrations were microfilmed for public access in their respective Presidential libraries. Before leaving the AEC, Dr. Seaborg got it all cleared virtually without deletion. Then lunacy descended. Or rather, the Atomic Energy Commission became the Department of Energy and bureaucracy got going. Seaborg writes of all this in an article `Secrecy Runs Amok' published in Science in 1994. It seems that in 1983 the chief historian of the Department asked to borrow one of two sets of the journal, some 26 volumes in all, for work on a history of the Commission. By the time the author got his journal back passage after passage was redacted, much of it explicitly public information, such as the published code names of nuclear weapons tests, some of it purely personal, as for example his description of accompanying his children on a trick or treat outing on a Halloween evening. The 26 volumes, `in expurgated form' as Seaborg puts it, are now available in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress. But where does one go for sanity? Seaborg writes: `With the beginning of the Reagan administration, the government had begun to take a much more severe and rigid position with regard to secrecy.' The balance between the `right of the public to know' and the `right of the nation to protect itself' was simply lost as, often apologetic, investigators poured over the papers of the great Americans of the time. 
Dr. Seaborg recently came to my office seeking assistance in cutting through the bureaucracy. At this stage in his career he should not be forced to expend valuable time and energy trying to get back what he lent the Department of Energy. I immediately agreed to offer what assistance I could, having had experience of such matters as chairman of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. 
Last week, with the energy and water appropriations bill nearly ready for conference, I thought there might be a chance to include a provision that would require the return of the unedited journal to Dr. Seaborg. I wrote to the chairman and ranking members of the subcommittee, asking for their help. On Tuesday, September 23, the clerk for Senator Reid, the ranking member of the subcommittee, reported to my staff that there had been a long staff discussion on the matter, that it was agreed the Department of Energy had acted inappropriately, that the journal was a valuable historical document, and that things looked promising for including the provision in the conference report. 
The report was filed today with no mention of the Seaborg journal. This afternoon the clerk for Senator Domenici, the chairman, reported that the Department of Energy had been consulted and that they had raised objections to the return of the unexpurgated journal. And so, absent the opportunity for a hearing, the provision was dropped. I suppose doing the right thing for Dr. Seaborg in a simple, expedient manner was too much to expect. I suppose it was wishful thinking that the Department would do its part to rectify the situation. So, Mr. President, I am introducing the same provision as a free-standing bill. I look forward to a hearing on the matter, which the appropriations staff advocates, so that at least this one egregious example of the regulation and control of valuable public information can be brought to light and, I trust, remedied.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we learn today in the New York Times that an alarming number of companies and governments are failing to cope with the impending year 2000 computer crisis. 
A study by the respected Gartner Group, which specializes on information technology, indicates that fully `30 percent of companies worldwide had not started addressing the year 2000 problem,' and that of those `88 percent were smaller companies.' This is most troubling news. Failure to comply could lead, in the opinion of William J. McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to a global recession. 
Analysts are also predicting that many companies will go out of business when their computer systems fail at the turn of the century. Again I quote the Times article: `Edward Yardeni, the chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, issued a report last week saying that there is a 35-percent chance that the millennium bug will cause `at least a mild global recession' in 2000.' 
My first day bill, S. 22, would establish an independent commission, more like a task force, to ensure that the Federal Government will be compliant, and to ensure that awareness and compliance will be raised in the private sector.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this weekend a glorious and important event will take place in Monticello, NY. On Sunday, September 20, 1997, the Courthouse in Sullivan County will be renamed the Lawrence H. Cooke Sullivan County Courthouse. Judge Cooke, a native of Monticello, is one of our State's more distinguished jurists. His legal career spans almost 60 years and is highlighted by his tenure from 1979 through 1984 as the chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, our State's highest court. 
While Judge Cooke may be best known for his time on the court of appeals and his many years as a judge, practicing attorney, and town supervisor in Sullivan County, he also served as a member of my Judicial Screening Committee from 1985 through 1993. During his 8 years on the committee he provided wise counsel in helping me select candidates for Federal judgeships to be nominated by the President. While not necessarily the most glamorous part of being a Senator, selecting individuals for nomination to a Federal judgeship is one of our most important responsibilities. Long after a Senator has left the body, the judges whom he/she helped select may remain on the bench for many more years to come with life tenure. Judge Cooke provided invaluable assistance to me in this endeavor and I am pleased to say that he is now lending his talents to New York Governor George Pataki by serving on the Governor's judicial screening committee for State judgeships. 
When I travel around New York State, one of the things I like to do if I have a couple of free minutes is to visit the local county courthouse. In most places, the courthouse is a grand and beautiful old building, and the courthouse in Sullivan County is no exception. Sullivan County was founded in 1809 and the current courthouse is actually the third it has had. The original burned down in 1844 and the second was replaced by the current structure in 1909. The newly named Cooke Courthouse is an Ohio sandstone building which was designed by William Beardsley of Poughkeepsie and built by the Kingston firm of Campbell and Dempsey for $143,000. In 1979 the building underwent a major renovation. It is a beautiful and historic building well befitting of Judge Cooke's name. 
Mr. President, 1997 marks the sesquicentennial of the New York State Court of Appeals. With the exception of the U.S. Supreme Court, this court is perhaps the most important court in our Nation's legal history. One of the greatest jurists of the 20th century, Benjamin Cardozo, was a chief judge of this court before being nominated by President Franklin Roosevelt to the Supreme Court. Even today, every law student must read several of Judge Cardozo's opinions as part of a legal education and his opinion in Palsgraff versus Long Island Railroad is still the seminal case on proximate cause in torts. The current chief judge, Judith Kaye, is nationally recognized as a leader in judicial reform, especially in the area of jury selection. It is a proud and important tradition with which Judge Cooke is associated, and he certainly is an important part of that tradition. 
On this special day on which we honor Judge Cooke, I want to wish the Judge and his wife Alice the best and thank him for his many years of service to me, to Sullivan County, to New York State, and to our justice system.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise in the firmest opposition to this proposal. 
Might I first state that I have not the least difficulty with the thought of the distinguished Senators that there might be more funds made available to deal with gang violence among Indian populations. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition. I do not claim any specific knowledge in my awareness of anything notable in that way of difficulty in the State of New York. 
But, sir, I am appalled that this reasonable, modest proposal should be advanced at the expense and the effect of destroying the national memorial to President Woodrow Wilson. I have to tell you I was aggrieved to hear the gratuitous comments about the Woodrow Wilson Center that have just been made here on the floor. 
There is a history, Mr. President, and I will not go into it in any great detail, but I am prepared to spend the rest of the day and tomorrow, if need be. But let me see if I cannot be brief about this so that the Senate can get on with its work. 
In 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution, called upon President Kennedy to appoint a bipartisan commission for the purpose of proposing an appropriate memorial to Woodrow Wilson in the Nation's Capital. We have just seen the opening of the superbly designed memorial to President Roosevelt. In a time sequence, it is not inappropriate that a memorial to President Wilson would take place a quarter century earlier. 
In 1968, after a bipartisan commission had deliberated the matter, it was proposed that there be a living memorial to President Wilson--not a statue and not a fountain. And in all truth, he was never known to be seated on a horse. 
The idea arose from the same proposition put forth by the American Historical Association that said that, for all the fine universities, there was not a center for advanced studies here in the Nation's Capital where persons from around the world, and principally from the United States, could come and work in our archives, work on our various subjects, 
land that wouldn't it be a fine thing that there should be such, and why not have it as a memorial to President Wilson, who was a university professor, university president, a great teacher. 
In 1968, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Act was passed. The act's preamble stipulates that this memorial is not to be a statue or a building bearing Wilson's name but rather a living institution expressing `his accomplishments as the 28th President of the United States: A distinguished scholar, an outstanding university president and a brilliant advocate of international understanding.' 
There is a nice bit of history here which I will not ask anybody to elucidate further, but the measure provides that the chairman of the board of trustees be from the private sector and there be a mix of public and private individuals, all appointed by the President. 
On his last day in office, President Johnson appointed Vice President Hubert Humphrey to be the first chairman of the first board of trustees. It was something Hubert Humphrey, beloved Senator that we all know and remember so well, that is what he wished to leave in public life, as he assumed he would be doing, and go forward with. 
It happened at that time I had been appointed assistant to President Nixon. In my own work I have done some writing about Woodrow Wilson. President Nixon asked if I would be the first vice chairman. Now, there is a little bit of a problem here because if Lyndon B. Johnson was President, then Hubert H. Humphrey would be Vice President--not exactly a person in the private sector--but President Nixon was not going to make an issue of that. 
This is something everybody knew about at the time and was excited about at the time, and so we went forward. We have been at this now for 30 years. The International Center has established an international reputation. The world over, there are persons in universities, in governments, who have been fellows here and retained a tie to the institution that is important. One does not wish to overstate, but it is an important fact of international life, particularly in the area of diplomacy. 
I might make the point that our present Secretary of State, most luminous and indefatigable Madeleine Albright, was a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center, and on the occasion of the 25th anniversary, President Bush arranged a dinner in the State Department. There were a series of lectures. At one of these, Madeleine Albright had this sort of happy remark, in a lecture. She said, `Let me begin by wishing a happy 25th birthday to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. I will never forget my own time at the center as a Wilson fellow. Where else can one do truly independent research, meet scholars from all over the world and get paid for working in a castle? I have always felt in a town full of monuments, the center is unique because it is a living monument. It memorializes not only Wilson, but Wilson's lifelong effort as an educator and President, to map a trail for a future that would elude the traps of the past.' 
She was referring, of course, to the Smithsonian Institution. 
At the time the center began, small amounts of money were made available from the Congress--about $5 million a year; now less. A fundraising effort has been made by the trustees to raise private funds. They now are a larger part of the budget than what the Federal Government provides. But there was no place to locate. Such was the expectation and understanding that the then Secretary of the Smithsonian, the Honorable S. Dillon Ripley, turned over that great Renwick Building, the Smithsonian Institution on the Mall, to the center. It's called among the family of Smithsonian workers the castle, and indeed it is a castle of sorts. It has been there ever since until just this moment. We have completed, on Pennsylvania Avenue, as the statute requires and dictates, a building for the center as part of the Ronald Reagan Building, which will be dedicated next spring. 
Let me take the liberty, Mr. President, of citing comments of 
a few Presidents of the United States. First of all, Lyndon Johnson, who signed the legislation, said `The dream of a great scholarly center in the Nation's Capital is as old as the Republic itself * * * This Center could serve as an institution of learning that the 22nd century will regard as having influenced the 21st.' 
There was a certain serendipity that its first 30 years should be located in the Smithsonian building. The Smithsonian building was created there for the advance and diffusion of knowledge--primarily in the sciences but also in other areas. Here was the incubator for this new center, `an institution of learning that the 22nd century will regard as having influenced the 21st.' 
Later in my remarks I will note that there is ample evidence that it has already influenced the 20th century. 
Jimmy Carter: `The Wilson Center is a nucleus of intellectual curiosity and collaboration on issues of critical importance to our national well-being.' 
George Bush, who, as I say, hosted a dinner at the State Department on one of the anniversaries, said, `In this alliance of scholars now world-renowned for exploring some of the most vital issues that confront mankind, Woodrow Wilson's ideals find their highest and most effective expression.' 
Ronald Reagan, in whose building the center will be part: `The work of this organization symbolizes the yearning by Americans to understand the past and bring the lessons of history to bear upon the present.' 
Richard M. Nixon: `One of the most significant additions to Pennsylvania Avenue will be an international center for scholars, to be a living memorial to Woodrow Wilson. There could hardly be a more appropriate memorial to a President who combined a devotion to scholarship with a passion for peace. The District has long sought, and long needed, a center for both men of letters and men of affairs.' 
And now to our own President at this moment, William Jefferson Clinton, and this was just recently: `Three years ago I had the pleasure of signing legislation designating the great public space that will lead from Pennsylvania Avenue to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars as 'Woodrow Wilson Plaza.' Now that the Woodrow Wilson Center is preparing to move into its own home, fronting on the plaza, I salute its world-renowned contributions to scholarship, international understanding, and public service over the last 30 years. The Wilson Center will be a true living memorial to one of our great Presidents.' 
I might add, just as a matter of serendipity, that the center will be part of that building construction, the Ronald Reagan Building, which will finally complete, after 70 years, the Federal Triangle, which was begun by Herbert Hoover, under Hoover's Presidency. Hoover was a great admirer of Wilson and was himself an author of one of the finest books ever written on President Wilson. 
This 30th anniversary, this impending move and the decision here in the Congress to see that the building will finally go up--no hurry, 30 years. It will be furnished out of private donations. Just this spring there was a large dinner in New York where our most distinguished Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Alan Greenspan, gave an extraordinary address at which we raised--it is a public matter--almost $1 million with a matching pledge for the furnishings, the books, the desks, tables, and such. 
On September 8 of this year the New York Times had an editorial on the center saying, `The center has been a tone of civility during political and cultural wars and a refuge for those persecuted elsewhere.' 
A center for civility. You would be surprised how often a comment returns to that quality in the Senate. 
The Times goes on, `The Center's House,' referring to the House of Representatives, `critics fault for lacking a public policy function by overemphasizing scholarly pursuits. This seems perversely to miss the point. Washington is amply stocked with policy think tanks, and the Center was never meant to churn out position papers. The hope, instead, was to provide a forum where politicians and officials might encounter those more alien muses of history, philosophy and literature.' 
Could you dispute that the center has stimulated prize-winning books, animated innumerable public workshops and published a lively quarterly? Every Federal dollar appropriated for the center is matched by a private donor.' 
It goes on in that spirit. 
The New York Times is generally thought to be a paper disposed to liberal views--its editorial page. The Weekly Standard, newly and happily arrived in Washington, is nothing of the sort. Its editor, William Kristol, is an avowed and energetic, hugely influential conservative. The Weekly Standard ran an editorial a little while ago when this dispute was coming out in the House, and it said, `Save the Wilson Quarterly!' That is a published journal, scholarly, lively, published once a quarter, and it said this: `Having somehow resisted the p.c.'--political correctness--`trendiness that has contaminated the academy, the Wilson Center, under the auspices of the Smith1sonian Institution, remains one of the few havens for disinterested scholarship * * *.' 
I suppose, in the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I am a regent of the Smithsonian, and I believe at this point I am the senior regent appointed from the Senate, as well as the House. 
But it says, `Having somehow resisted the p.c. trendiness that has contaminated the academy, the Wilson Center, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, remains one of the few havens for disinterested scholarship in the country.' 
I began by quoting the New York Times editorial page, a page of liberal opinion. I went on to quote an editorial from the Weekly Standard, a journal of assertively conservative opinion. 
Let me now quote George F. Will, one of the most learned, thoughtful, entertaining, and rewarding observers of the Washington scene we have had in a long time. When he is not writing about baseball, he tends to write about politics. Occasionally, he enters the world of such as we are now talking about. He refers to an essay published in the Wilson Quarterly: `The invaluable quarterly of the irreplaceable Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.' 
See, we have here a living memorial to a great President, well established, known worldwide, read worldwide. There is a web site, there is a radio program called `Dialog.' There is no end. There are 200,000 listeners each week. We don't want to put this center at jeopardy. 
I am not in the least at a disinclination to provide funds for juvenile delinquency programs in Indian tribes or populations. But at the cost, we can find those funds somewhere. To destroy this irreplaceable institution. We will start again. And, sir, it takes 30 years to take root. 
We have had a wonderful fortune in the persons who have led the Center. James Billington, the present Librarian of Congress, himself a great historian, particularly of the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Empire that succeeded it. James H. Billington is a trustee now, but he was a great director for the longest while. 
Then it was the fortune of the center to have for a long period another distinguished scholar, a great administrator, great person, Charles Blitzer, who has just announced, at age 70, his retirement, but after a distinguished career. He had been Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian when the castle was opened up to welcome the new institution. He went from here to be director of the National Center for the Humanities in North Carolina, and then he was summoned back to the Wilson Center, and now having reached the age of retirement, has announced he will retire at the time a successor is chosen. It might give you a sense, sir, of the importance attached by Americans of every disposition to the Center to know what the search committee is for the new director. 
First, James A. Baker III, former Secretary of State and 
trustee of the Wilson Center. Next, James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress. Mary Brown Bullock, a former fellow, former director of the Wilson Center Asia Program, and now president of Agnes Scott College. William T. Coleman, Jr., a Wilson council member, former Secretary of Transportation, and a distinguished attorney here in Washington. I. Michael Heyman, a trustee and the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Gertrude Himmelfarb, one of the great scholars of our age, a person who has transcended understanding of Victorian Britain. The British learn about their history from Gertrude Himmelfarb today. She was formerly a fellow at the Center, professor emeritus at City University of New York, and a former trustee. Chris Kennan, former Wilson council member. Elizabeth McCormack, Associate, Rockefeller Family & Associates, and former President of Manhattanville College. Finally, Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., Wilson council member and managing partner of Capricorn Management. 
You see, sir, an extraordinary array of support, every President since Lyndon Johnson who lined the legislation has attested--in this case, to his hopes and now to the realization of those hopes for this center. Scholars from the world over. Our own Secretary of State--a great quarterly, an extraordinary audience in the world at a minimal cost to our budget and great advantage to our Nation. 
Mr. President, I cannot imagine that we would do this act of desecration. I would happily pledge my support to any effort to provide funds for a juvenile delinquency program. But for now, I trust this amendment will be withdrawn and, if not, it will be defeated. I hope it would not have to have a vote. I cannot imagine the U.S. Senate, which created this institution, having to vote on destroying it for another purpose altogether, unrelated and as regards this issue of a profoundly different order of importance. 
Mr. President, I thank you. Seeing my friend from Colorado on the floor, I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generous remarks about the center. But I also say that it is so easy to make fun of studies of ancient times and obscure subjects. But a great deal comes with them. 
In that New York Times editorial I spoke of, it says at one point: 
That such a forum is needed was suggested by a Senator's inept award several decades ago of a `golden fleece' to a Wilson scholar for writing a paper on how Russia's czars persecuted nomadic minorities centuries ago. This scene was not remote or irrelevant to the author, Bronislaw Geremek, the Polish medievalist who was to play a pivotal role in the Solidarity movement. 
`who was to play a pivotal role in the Solidarity movement.' 
In the humanities, as in natural sciences, ideas often spring from improbable intersections. 
I make a point again about a certain `improbable' intersection. 
It was a study by a Polish medievalist of the way in which a central Russian empire persecuted nomadic tribes. 
It was thought ridiculous here, but was part of the creation of a career which led to the independence of Poland. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Washington for his generosity. 
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I say in response to my friend from Arizona, first of all, that the remark about being paid to work in a castle was just a friendly joke by Madeleine Albright, now our Secretary of State. She was a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in the 1980's. 
As far as I know, no fellow makes $43,000 a year. No one is above that. Some come for short periods, others for longer periods. Some come to the center and spend much of their time in the archives of the Library of Congress. It is a center for scholars, and they are different one from another. They have different views. And they have to be let do their work as they will. 
Remember how Madeleine Albright finished her remarks. She said of the center: 
It memorializes not only Wilson but Wilson's lifelong effort as an educator and President to map a trail for the future that will elude the traps of the past. 
The cost of this is so small. Some stipends are moderate, are barely up to the living levels, a third of what an executive in one of our executive departments makes, but no one is in that life for the salary and no one is at the center for this purpose. The world is proud of what we have done. I hope, sir, the Senate would do the same. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this point, if I may, to introduce a letter sent by the distinguished Librarian of Congress James Billington to the second director after Mr. Baroody of the Center, Joseph Flom, who is chairman of the board of trustees, setting forth the principal point that a center for scholars is not a think tank. It does not produce policy papers or policymakers. It can produce policymakers. It produced Madeleine Albright, just for an example today, but it has a different purpose, one declared by Congress when Congress enacted this legislation in 1989. 
I yield the floor and I thank the Chair. 
I ask unanimous consent it be printed in Record.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I must apologize to my friend. He accurately describes this passage from Mr. Barr's article on the Federal Page and the average stipend. But if I could just take a moment to go on to say what this same article says: 
Previous and current fellows include Raul Alfonsin, the former President of Argentina; Anatoliy Dobrynin, the former Soviet Ambassador to the United States; Washington Post reporter Thomas B. Edsal; New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman; novelist Carlos Fuentes; Harvard University Professor Samuel P. Huntington, and Itamar Rabinovich, the former Israeli Ambassador here. 
This is a great institution, been a great success. Can we not leave it to its great desserts, as it was intended? 
I do want to tell my colleague I was in error, and I do apologize.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there appears to be some movement on my idea to appoint a commission--which will act more like a special task force--to oversee the Federal Government's handling of the year 2000 problem. In this morning's Federal Page of the Washington Post, a story entitled `Year 2000' Report Flunks 3 Agencies' reports that `three house Republicans called on President Clinton to appoint a special aide to tackle the computer problem.' In July 1996, I wrote the President and proposed the creation of just such a `Y2K czar.' But the administration is still confident that the Office of Management and Budget can handle the job. Like my House counterparts, I fear OMB may not have the time or the resources to handle this issue. 
In 1997, fearing the private sector's lagging awareness, I realized that perhaps a task force could increase awareness in the private sector while ensuring compliance in the public sector. 
Thus I introduced a first day bill, S. 22, to address this matter through a special task force. S. 22 is cosponsored by 16 Senators and has been endorsed by the New York Stock Exchange [NYSE]. The enormity of this problem demands a task force of experts to ensure compliance. I hope my colleagues agree.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor to rise in support of the distinguished chairman's remarks in regard to the proposed allocation of appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
I will presume upon the Senate's time on a relatively quiet afternoon to give just a little background of the measure that is before the Senate today. 
Once again we seem to be doing a major disservice to ourselves with the politicization of matters that ought to be as far from politics as ever is possible: the support the Government provides, not expensive but nonetheless critical, for the arts of our Nation. 
It would seem that the National Endowment for the Arts is challenged on three fronts: first, whether our Nation even needs Federal funding for the arts, second, that the Endowment should do more to reduce objectionable art, and third, that the current grant apparatus disproportionately funds some regions more than others. If I might, I may be able to shed light on this triumverate. 
I was present at the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts which we are debating today, which we debated last year, and which we will debate henceforth how long, who knows. 
It was begun in a time of great national agreement on this subject and a rather clearer understanding, if I may say, than we sometimes have now, on the nature of this subject. This all began in the summer of 1961 when the musicians in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York announced they could not continue under the contract they had with the trustees. They were members of local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. 
Indeed, the prospect confronted us all that the Metropolitan, the Met, as we say in New York, would have to cancel its 1961-62 season. Then some inspired person had the thought, why not ask the newly appointed Secretary of Labor, Arthur J. Goldberg, to arbitrate the dispute? It was a natural thing for him to do; he was Secretary of Labor, this was a labor dispute. He was a great 
supporter of activities of this kind, a man of huge, varied talent. As an American Jew, he had served in the OSS behind German lines during World War II. He had been very close to the steelworkers. He had helped bring about the merger between the AFL and the CIO, what we now call the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. 
His wife Dorothy was a supremely gifted artist. He moved easily in the world of the arts, as well as of business and labor and government. He went on, of course, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, and then in an act of great self-sacrifice--and he knew it at the time; I was with him at the time--he accepted the demand, if you put it that way, from President Johnson that he leave the Court and go to New York to be the United States permanent representative at the United Nations at a time of cold war crisis. It was his way to do such things and to accept such assignments. 
Now, in the life of the things he had done, arbitrating a dispute between, I believe, some 62 musicians and a well-established and attractive, civic-minded charity was not especially challenging, except he found something out. He found, as he put it, `Mrs. August Belmont and Mrs. Lewis W. Douglas, who were the leaders of the trustees, didn't have any money.' With the best will in the world, they could not meet the requests that the union was making. They were then making $170 dollars a month. That comes to about $45 a week. That, sir, amounts to about $1 an hour. The minimum wage was twice that, or thereabouts, at that time. They were persons of world standing in the arts, but the arts could not provide them a living. What they were asking for was $268 a month--something like $60 a week, something like $1.50 an hour. With the best view in the world, all that Secretary Goldberg could do was to offer them a $10 a month raise. They made their living teaching and doing other things. They were devoted to music, but they had families, too, and the ordinary interests of persons who live an ordinary life, an ordinary citizen. 
What they were caught up with--and I do not want to take the Senate into a long discourse on economics, but it is a matter which comes to this floor in one mode or another almost every day--they were caught up with what came to be known as the cost disease of the personal services. This was a concept worked out by a great American economist, happily still vigorously pursuing his works, William Jay Baumol, then at Princeton University. He and his wife were opera lovers, as it happened, and he, too, noticed about this time that the Metropolitan Opera orchestra always seemed to be about to go on strike--this problem, that problem--and what was the matter here? 
His main field in economics is deeply abstract, hugely influential studies of transaction costs and things like that. But he said, well, listen, if I'm an economist, I ought to be able to understand some of this, and he came up with the idea of the cost disease. His colleagues, as is frequently the case in medicine and physics and economics, began to call this Baumol's disease. 
It can be very easily explained. The productivity of personal services does not grow, or grows very slowly compared to the productivity generally in the economy. You could put it this way. In 1797, if you wished to perform a Mozart quartet, you needed four persons, four stringed instruments, and 43 minutes. Two centuries go by and to produce that stringed quartet you need four persons, four stringed instruments, and 43 minutes. 
If the great Mormon Temple Choir undertook to do a Bach oratory when it was founded, I believe there are 350 members of that choir, so to do a Bach oratory in 1897, that would take 350 musicians an hour and a half. A century goes by and it still takes 350 persons and an hour and a half. That is called Baumol's disease. If you play the `Minute Waltz' in 50 seconds, you speed up productivity but you do not get quite the same product. 
That is why teachers are relatively more expensive than farmers. Farmers have quadrupled and quintupled and quintupled again their productivity, but a first-grade teacher can handle about 18 young 6- or 7-year-olds in 50-minute classes; you can put 190 kids in that class and it would not be the same. 
That is why we always have friction in our economy between those activities where we depend very much on the personal services and those which involve the mechanized services or the electronic services--think what we have seen in productivity in computation in the last 20 years. 
Secretary Goldberg thought what to do, and I think at this removed place in time it is no indiscretion to say he called me in and said, `Pat, I have no money for these musicians. We have to give them hope,' and he said, `Write a portion of my arbitration decision which says it's time the Federal Government gets into the business of helping with the arts.' 
This is not a new idea. George Washington wrote to a Rev. Joseph Willard, March 22, 1781, and said, `The arts and sciences are essential to the prosperity of the state and to the ornament and happiness of human life. They have a claim to the encouragement of every lover of his country and mankind.' 
It was as clear to George Washington as a matter could be. A few years later--that was in 1781. In 1785, Jefferson wrote to Madison:  
You see, I am an enthusiast on the subject of the arts, but it is an enthusiasm of which I am not ashamed, as its object is to improve the taste of my countrymen to increase their reputation, to reconcile them to the respect of the world, and to procure them its praise. 
And so, Mr. President, on that occasion, the arbitration decision was accompanied by a statement urging U.S. support for the performing arts. The New York Times--and forgive my provincialism, as that is where I come from--announced this on the front page, and this was Friday, December 15, 1961: 
Goldberg Urges U.S. To Subsidize Performing Arts. He Asks Business and Labor To Help as He Gives Pay Increase in Met Dispute. 
Then it says, `Excerpts from proposals aid for the arts * * *.' 
Inside, they printed the text of Goldberg's statement urging U.S. support for performing arts. 
Washington, December 14--Following is the text of Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg's statement on `The State of the Performing Arts,' which was included in his findings in the Metropolitan Opera dispute. 
The statement begins. 
The financial crisis of the Metropolitan Opera, which raised the prospect that the 1961-62 season might not take place, may prove to have been an event of larger significance in this history of American culture. 
And, sir, it has. As the Senator from Vermont and Senators supporting this measure on both sides of the aisle will know, the National Endowment moved in direct sequence from the Goldberg finding to President Kennedy to the White House where President Kennedy established an advisory commission on the arts and humanities. Let's remember that the humanities are still part of this. Earlier, we heard the distinguished Senator from Michigan talking about the public papers of Presidents, which are now being very steadily published and compiled--they had not been, but now they are. 
Now, the question is, were we aware that one day we might be on the floor of the U.S. Senate facing charges like that? Sir, I would like to say with considerable vigor--if that is the term--of course, we were. We knew perfectly well that once the Federal Government got into the question of funding for the arts, we would get into the question of what arts to fund. It is not a very complicated sequence. This statement says,  
President Kennedy observed not long ago that the Federal Government `cannot order that culture exist, but the Government can and should provide the climate and the freedom, deeper and wider education, and the intellectual curiosity in which culture flourishes.' 
And then Secretary Goldberg's prescient finding on the nature of our debate today: 
The issue of Federal support for the arts immediately raises problems. Many persons oppose Federal support on grounds that it will inevitably lead to political interference. This is by no means an argument to be dismissed, and the persons who make it are to be honored for their concern for the freedom of artistic expression. In an age in which a third of the globe languishes under the pathetic banalities of `Socialist realism,' let no one suppose that political control of the arts cannot be achieved. 
I might say that again. 
In an age in which a third of the globe languishes under the pathetic banalities of `Socialist realism'-- 
As it was called in the Soviet Union-- let no one suppose that political control of the arts cannot be achieved. 
As we look in that direction in the world right now, we realize that there are limits to such control, and the efforts of 
Government to control the arts will never, in the end, succeed. I will go back to our statement, sir. 
Justice Goldberg said, `The overwhelming evidence is that the free American society has shown deep respect for the artistic integrity of the artist. Every attempt to interfere with that freedom has been met with vigorous opposition, not least from the artistic community * * * Artists are as susceptible to pressure as the next person, but for every artist who capitulates there is another from that unruly band to take his place, which the late Russell Lynes has described as the `uncaptured, the disrespectful, and the uncomfortable searchers after truth.' 
I don't want to make any special case for work that has no real purpose, save to shock--although some work that shocks in one generation is revered in the next. We would be very wrong to forget that. Artists have always sort of known it. In 1939, one of the great American painters, John Sloan, one of those who organized the armory show of 1913 in Manhattan, which brought the postimpressionist French painters from the School of Paris to Manhattan, and it shocked everybody. Picasso was shocking, as were the others. But in very short order they came to be revered. It took a generation, but it did happen. 
Sloan once said, in 1939--and he had a particular kind of humor in this regard, also a kind of clairvoyance. He said: 
It would be good to have a Ministry of Fine Art. Then we would know where the enemy is. 
Indeed, I can recall an occasion when this subject was raised in a hearing before the Finance Committee and some witness, someone out of patience, said, `All right, Senator, what would you do to have the Government encourage the arts?' I said, `Well, offhand, the only thing I can think to do would be for the Government to forbid them.' That always has a lively effect, as we can look around the history of the world and the history of the 20th century and find out. But what we are doing here is supporting the arts. 
The National Endowment began as an effort to provide a living wage for musicians in a situation where, through no fault of their own, through the workings of the economic system--I mean the laws of economics, of productivity change, they needed public support, and it has flourished. It was a very interesting fact that after President Kennedy's assassination, the first thing this body did was to propose that a cultural center that was being discussed for the arts be named the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. That was a center that needed public support to make it possible in the present day. Those resources were there, and that activity has become part of the life of our Capital. 
Nonetheless it remains the case, inevitably it is the case, that there are places where particularly intensive activities in the arts occur--our third proposition at issue today. It is somehow in the nature of creative work that it tends to concentrate in one place and bring people to it. It is the normal experience of the arts, particularly large and expensive activities which involve musicians and performers and composers, as well as audiences. New York has been such a place since the beginning. 
It has been argued that it cannot be fair that one third of NEA grants go to six cities--with New York at the top. As it was when we examined this subject three decades ago, New York is the center of the arts--as it is of the visual arts, as it is of publishing--as it has been from the time we started our Nation with New York as the Capital. 
The purpose of culture is not to serve the Nation, but we speak proudly of our role in the last two centuries. And to the extent that we do, we speak of the things that have happened, to an extraordinary degree, things that have happened in the city of New York by people who came from all over the country--and the world--to that center of creative activity. 
Some propose that we take money away from the city of New York and distribute it elsewhere. This idea is very different. The idea is to strike at the artistic activities and expressions which are found at the center of the Nation's art world. There is something foreboding here. Do we break up the country into its competing parts? Do we want to go back to a time when those who had kept? They did not share--to reach out and bring to a place that did not have things they might need in health, in education, in standards of relations between labor and management--in a sense of sharing of common culture, of diffusing, and enriching of culture. I do hope not. 
It all began, sir--and I will conclude on this thought--at a time of promise in our Nation--great threat and danger, good God, yes, but promise, good spirits and creativity in Government. The Government thought through a problem that the public had, that the polity had, that the culture had, and came up with some answers. They have proven themselves powerfully important in what has now been almost two generations. And I would hope that this moment of unparalleled prosperity, with the United States--we wrote of a third of the world `languishing under the banalities of Socialist realism,' all that gone, and could we not relax a little bit and do what the chairman and able committee wishes done and get on with the other matters of State. The arts will be there whether we wish them or not and, in the main, I think we do wish that they will be.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will support the amendment of the Senator from Illinois to repeal section 1604(f)(3) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which purports to credit the increase in tobacco excise taxes against any federally legislated tobacco settlement agreement. While I have opposed other amendments that would have opened up the balanced budget agreement signed into law on August 5, 1997, a mere 5 legislative days ago, there are good reasons to support the amendment offered by Senator Durbin. Unlike the other provisions of the reconciliation legislation that have been the subject of amendments, the provision at issue in the Durbin amendment is an orphan. No one is willing publicly to take credit for having written it and securing its inclusion in the tax bill--which was done at the last minute, without analysis or debate by the Members of either the House or Senate. 
On July 31, 1997, during the debate on the conference report to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the Senator from Illinois sought to raise a point of order against the provision he now seeks to repeal. I voted, with 77 other Senators to waive all points of order against the conference report. I said at the time that the provision was meaningless and had no binding effect. I continue to hold this view, as the tobacco settlement is far from completed, and it is still subject to approval by the President and Congress. Yesterday's New York Times reported that President Clinton will not offer an opinion on the proposed tobacco deal until next week at the earliest, and that the White House will not endorse a settlement without significant changes. In fact, it is beginning to appear unlikely that Congress will complete action on the matter before adjourning for the year. In addition to any changes that the administration proposes, the Congress will want to exercise its independent judgment on the proposed agreement. The June 20, 1997, agreement does not contain all of the details necessary to effectuate a settlement. There are a number of areas where the agreement provides no guidance, the most striking of which is the lack of a mechanism to govern the payment and distribution of the $368.5 billion by the cigarette manufacturers.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to support my revered and respected chairman in this regard. It is the case, sir, that 5 legislative days ago we passed this measure. It is a measure which originated in the House and in a good faith exchange in conference the Senate accepted it, the conferees did. There were three of us--Mr. Lott, the chairman, and myself. The bill passed Congress in a spending measure that was appropriate to the occasion. 
Now, first, although it is not technical, it is so profoundly important. This is legislation on an appropriations bill. It is the ancient wisdom of this body not to do such things. A point of order would obviously lie against the amendment. It is important. It is how we proceed in this body. 
Further, sir, on the merits of this matter, I, for my part, would have to say I would like to see how this works. This is a 5-year period. I can attest, and I know that my colleague from New York and our chairman would agree, the Finance Committee has been seized with this subject. As the medical care system of our country becomes more rationalized, as economists would put it, as price considerations enter into markets and decisions are made, and health maintenance organizations rise and you see all manner of mergers and acquisitions and the general evidence of a market which is good, you also find yourself with some of those effects which are common which involve institutions or desirable behaviors that markets do not provide. 
In the profession of economics, they are known as public goods. Everybody benefits from public goods so nobody will pay for them. If you want them, you have to find them in a public mode. That is why we have public schools. That is why we have, come to think about it, why we have the Marine Corps. These are public goods that you have to provide for in the collective mode. 
In 1994, as the Finance Committee was considering the health care legislation sent to us by the administration we found ourselves more and more interested in the question of medical schools. In this new world, who takes care of these special 
institutions which have high prices? They have high prices because they have high costs. They have high costs because they are teaching. 
We had a wonderful exchange and I am sure the chairman recalls it. One morning a witness from Fordham University, an ethicist, Father Charles J. Fahey said, `What I am seeing is the `commodification' of medicine--a wonderful phrase. The then head of the UCLA Medical Center, Raymond G. Schultze, said at another hearing `Can I give you an example? In southern California we now have a spot market for bone marrow transplants.' 
All that is something that is to be welcomed. It is happening anyway, going to happen in whatever market for medical care, and we have to provide some nonmarket provisions for these singular institutions, these great teaching hospitals, in the great age of medical science. In the history of the species it is only in the last 40 or 50 years--40 some say, 50 radicals would say--that medicine has really been able to do something. It is learning exponentially, learning by the hour. 
In this situation there can be a surplus of some doctors generally, of some specialists in particular, some judgments need to be made, and this transition needs to be made. 
As I understood the legislation, I think the chairman would agree, we were proposing a 5-year transition period to see whether we did not get good results--we will not know in the next 5 years, at least--to save money. 
It has a clear and necessary purpose. On both grounds, Mr. President, I rise to join the chairman. First of all this is legislation on an appropriation bill, which we must not have. Secondly, this is a measure that was included in the Balanced Budget Act only just this moment, and it is in response to a real life situation in an open experimental mode. In 5 year's time we will know more, and I plead--this is a subject that will not go away. We will be debating this matter, the matter of teaching hospitals and medical schools on the floor of the U.S. Senate for a quarter century to come. 
I join the chairman in proposing that we not approve this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply and succinctly for the purpose of endorsing the statement by our revered chairman and, once again, to say, as he put it, the ink is scarcely dry on this legislation and here we are changing it. Could it have been 5 legislative days since it was last enacted, and we are changing it? 
And, importantly, this is legislation on an appropriations bill. It is not in the interest of our institution to let that begin. It is a lesson we have learned in difficult ways in the 19th century, and we have shown how important it has been in this century. As we approach a new century, it is no precedent to establish. 
I believe we will now move to the measure indicated by the Senator from Delaware.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the news from Israel is painful to all who cherish the prophetic vision of peace in the Holy Land. On Sunday, September 26, 1993, less than 2 weeks after the signing of the Oslo accords, I addressed a public forum in New York City with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and declared, inter alia:  
And now, the Palestinian leaders have said, we will--at long last--beat our swords into plowshares. We will yield up Kalishnikovs and Katyushas to concentrate on the arts of accounting, civil administration, health care and construction. Now if any nation on Earth has a right to say `no' it was Israel. But Israel said `yes,' declaring, in the moving words of Prime Minister Rabin: `Enough!' We are willing to take this chance. To see your words converted to deeds. The Knesset has voted after a vigorous and thoughtful debate. The bedrock of the United States-Israeli friendship is our deep respect for Israeli democracy. The democracy has spoken and will have our support as it always has. 
The question of what response the Congress takes toward aid to the Palestinian Authority should reflect first and foremost the results of careful consultation with the Government of Israel. The Israeli Government has taken appropriate and firm measures in response to this latest atrocity. We must support them and let Chairman Arafat know that even the perception of his supporting terror is unacceptable to the American people, much less the thinly veiled utilization of terror as diplomacy by other means.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Mr. Charles Horsky, former adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson on the District of Columbia, passed away during the August recess. I rise today to pay honor to this man who devoted himself to improving our Nation's Capital. 
Charlie Horsky was the `Mayor of Washington.' And yet, he looked forward to giving that up and getting home rule for the city of Washington. He accomplished a great deal toward that end. Mr. Horsky was instrumental in redeveloping Pennsylvania Avenue, in promoting the construction of a metropolitan subway system, and he played a crucial role in establishing the initial home rule for the citizens of Washington. 
Further, he led the establishment of the National Building Museum, the John F. Kennedy Center of the Performing Arts, the University of the District of Columbia, and urged the preservation of Union Station. 
I first arrived in Washington over three decades ago. Since those initiatory days, I was most fortunate to have known and worked with Charlie Horsky. He was as fine a gentleman as we have seen in our Capital, and his tireless efforts are reflected in so many rejuvenated aspects of the city around us. When thinking of this great man we do well to recall the epitaph of Sir Christopher Wren at St. Pauls Cathedral, London: `Si monumentum requiris, circumspice.' (If you would see his monument, look around).

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, earlier today I voted to support Senator Harkin's amendment to fund the Food and Drug Administration's `Youth Tobacco Initiative' regulations. When this amendment was first offered on July 23, 1997, I voted to table it. I was concerned at that time that the offset was a tax; taxes fall under the jurisdiction of the Ways and Means and Finance Committees. I am pleased that Senator Harkin changed the offset so that I was able to vote for the amendment today. I am a strong supporter of the Food and Drug Administration's efforts to reduce the number of young people who begin smoking cigarettes each year. I believe that the money designated for that purpose today is crucial to the success of those efforts.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would repeal an irrational provision of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. I refer to section 1042 of that act, which took away the tax exempt status of TIAA-CREF, the Teacher's Insurance Annuity Association College Retirement Equities Fund. The legislation I am introducing today, with Senators D'Amato and Graham of Florida as original cosponsors, would simply strike section 1042 and restore the tax exemption that TIAA-CREF has been afforded since its establishment by Andrew Carnegie in 1918. Repeal of section 1042 would also serve to restore the tax exemption for Mutual of America, which has served as a pension administrator for social welfare organizations for over 50 years and was similarly tax-exempt until August 5, 1997, when the President signed the tax bill. 
TIAA-CREF is a 2-million member retirement system that serves 6,100 American colleges, universities, teaching hospitals, museums, libraries, and other nonprofit educational and research institutions. TIAA was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1937 to `forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the teaching profession.' Let me repeat--to `forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the teaching profession.' The law further states that the purpose of TIAA--this is the New York Statute--is `to aid and strengthen non-proprietary and non-profit-making colleges, universities, and other institutions engaged primarily in research.' And it has done just that, in an exemplary manner. It has long been recognized as a model of such programs. 
Mr. President, by charter and New York law, TIAA-CREF's pension assets are exclusively and irrevocably dedicated to providing retirement benefits to covered employees. Its funds are essentially equivalent to a multiple employer pension trust for colleges and universities. Like other pension trusts, TIAA-CREF should not be taxed. 
As a somewhat unanticipated result of TIAA-CREF's creation, it brought to American higher education portability of pensions. You did not have to start out in one institution and after a certain point stay there the rest of your life because you had to have some retirement benefit. This is of great value to our educational system for the simple reason that it enables a young person at, say, a 2-year college or a local college, who shows great promise, does good work, to end up at Chicago or Stanford or Duke, because they can move. This is part of the agility of American higher education. There is no reason to tax this. Earlier in the summer, the Finance Committee had said don't tax it, and the full Senate agreed. But somehow or other, the conference agreement provided otherwise. This was a mistake, and it wants to be corrected. 
The repeal of TIAA-CREF's 79-year-old tax exemption will cost the average retiree who receives a $12,000 annual pension about $600 in income, unless we act. Librarians are not highly paid. A $12,000 pension would be quite normal. A $600 reduction would be 5 percent right away. Future retirees currently accumulating benefits are likely to face reductions of 10 to 15 percent. 
Why make the lives of librarians and assistant professors and teachers in community colleges harder? We have an opportunity to undo this before the law takes effect in 1998. Why don't we? The Finance Committee said no to it. During the conference deliberations on the tax bill, nearly half the Members of the Senate, and dozens of Members of the House, signed letters asking the conferees to stand against repealing this tax exemption. 
Now it is September. Members of Congress have had a month-long opportunity to visit with and hear from the academic community. I am hopeful we can act on this legislation and restore TIAA-CREF and Mutual of America to their appropriate status as tax-exempt organizations before Congress adjourns for the year.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on this the first full day of Senate business since our adjournment for the August recess, I come to the floor with my colleague and friend from New York, Senator D'Amato, to address an issue of importance to New York, and of surpassing significance to our constitutional form of government. On August 11, for the first time in our history, President Clinton exercised his new authority under the Line Item Veto Act. In doing so he repealed, a provision of Federal law intended to relieve New York of up to $2.6 billion in disputed Medicaid claims. The provision had been included at Senator D'Amato's behest, and with my full support, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, one of the two major reconciliation bills signed into law on August 5 in a ceremony at the White House. 
Senator D'Amato and I rise today to state for the record our firm opposition to the President's repeal of the New York Medicaid provision, and to introduce a `disapproval bill' to reverse the President's action. I will also speak to the underlying question of the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. 
Each year, for 21 years now, I have issued a report on the balance of payments, as we put it, between New York State and the Federal Government. The twenty-first edition, now prepared in collaboration with the Taubman Center on State and Local Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government will be published toward the end of this month. Let me report for purposes of this comment, however, that it will show that New York has the third highest poverty rate in the Nation and the fourth highest Cost of Living Index--as computed by the Friar-Leonard State Cost of Living Index. This has resulted in an extraordinarily high level of Medicaid costs for the State and especially for the city of New York. 
This level of payments might have been sustainable with a more equitable Federal-State matching formula. If, for example, the Federal Government paid 73 percent as it does in Arkansas. But we were capped at 50 percent. As my colleague from New York knows, the current Federal-State Medicaid matching formula was taken directly from the Hill-Burton Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946, under which the matching rate is based on the square of the ratio of State per capita income and national per capita income. In a commencement address at Kingsborough Community College in New York 20 years ago, I suggested, only half jokingly, why not square root? If you are going to have algebra in Federal statutes, why not turn it our way? Given New York's 50-percent match rate, however, something had to be done. 
And so, like a number of other States, New York began to impose provider taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, and so forth, as a way of generating revenues to finance specific health care programs. As part of the costs incurred by providers, these taxes were reimbursable, withal at the 50-percent level, by the Federal Government. The taxes all went into additional health care, and no one could claim fraud. However, in recent years some States got too creative in imposing and seeking Federal matching funds for their provider taxes, in some instances using the Federal money for purposes unrelated to health care. This led Congress in 1991 to enact legislation to prevent States from gaming the system. Since New York was confident its taxes were in compliance with the 1991 law, the State continued its practice, all the while seeking a waiver from the Federal health care bureaucracy. 
And so, when the time came to draft the 1997 reconciliation bill, Senator D'Amato, a member of the Committee on Finance, asked that a provision be included that would simply preclude any Federal claims regarding the use of these taxes from 1991 to 1996. I fully supported this measure. The issue had been debated during our markup in the Finance Committee, and the provision was included in the final bill, which was passed by a large 73 to 27 majority. The conference report was adopted by an even larger majority, 85 to 15. 
As ranking member of the committee, I was on this floor with our esteemed chairman, Senator Roth, for several days and in meetings with House conferees and administration officials for an eternity, or so it seemed. Morning, noon, night; mostly night. Let the Record reflect that at no point in the course of those deliberations did the subject of the Medicaid waiver come up. No Member of the House challenged it; no representative of the administration said a word to me. In fact, the only administration objection that I know of was buried deep in the 21-page letter of administration views sent by OMB Director Raines on July 7, which said, in pertinent part: 
[T]he Senate bill would deem provider taxes as approved for one State. We have serious concerns about these provisions and would like to work with the Conferees to address the underlying problems. 
This was not the clearest possible statement. What, for example, does `deem' mean? Further, the term `serious concerns' is used any number of times in the administration's views, yet in none of those other instances did a line item veto result. `Serious concerns.' I ask my friend from New York, does that sound like a veto threat to him? In 20 years in the Senate, this Senator has heard many veto threats made, but never one like that. Yet this is evidently how we should expect things to work in the era of the line item veto. 
This leads to my second, larger, point. I am one of those--and I am not alone--who hold that the line-item veto is unconstitutional in that it violates the presentment clause of article I, section 7, which states: 
Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the President of the United States; if he approve, he shall sign it, but if not, he shall return it. 
When the Line Item Veto Act was first debated in the Senate in the spring of 1995, I argued--along with our revered colleague from West Virginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd, and others-- 
that the presentment clause means exactly what it says. But I'm afraid not many people were listening. 
Recall that the line item veto was part of item one in the Contract With America, which was then only a few months old. But we said: `Don't do this! It violates the principle of the separation of powers as we have understood it since George Washington was President.' For it was President Washington who wrote `From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in toto.' 
In lengthy statements here on the floor, Senators Byrd, Levin, Hatfield, and I--among others--argued as emphatically as we could. We cited the relevant case law--INS versus Chadha, Bowsher versus Synar; we quoted prominent constitutional scholars--Laurence H. Tribe, Michael J. Gerhardt. Yet in the end we were in a regrettably small minority. The Line Item Veto Act passed the Senate on March 23, 1995, by a vote of 69 to 29. When the conference report came back in March of 1996--a full year later--it passed by a vote of 69-31. Of the 31 Senators opposed, four of us felt the principle at stake was so consequential that it demanded immediate scrutiny by the courts. For which the Line Item Veto Act had explicitly provided: Section 3 of the act provides for `expedited review' of the statute's constitutionality by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The act further stated that `any Member of Congress or any individual adversely affected' could bring an action `on the ground that any provision of this part violates the Constitution.' 
Accordingly, on January 2 of this year, the first business day after the Line Item Veto Act took effect, I joined with Senator Byrd, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, former Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, and Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and David E. Skaggs of Colorado, as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the measure. We were represented on a pro bono basis by a team of distinguished and learned counsel, including Louis R. Cohen; Charles J. Cooper; Lloyd N. Cutler; Michael Davidson; and Alan B. Morrison. Oral argument was heard on March 21 by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. And less than 3 weeks later, on April 10, Judge Jackson held for us and declared the bill unconstitutional. He wrote in his opinion:  
. . . the Act effectively permits the President to repeal duly enacted provisions of federal law. This he cannot do. . . . The duty of the President with respect to such laws is to `take care that [they] be faithfully executed.' U.S. Const. art. II, sec. 3. Canceling, i.e., repealing, parts of a law cannot be considered its faithful execution. 
On June 26, however, the Supreme Court vacated the district court's judgment, holding in a 7-2 decision that as Members of Congress, we did not have `standing' to sue, as we could not demonstrate any personal, or `judicially cognizable,' injury. We do not agree; in our view, the measure shifts the balance of power between the Congress and President in direct contravention of article I, something that can only be done by constitutional amendment. But, of course, the Court left it for others to sue. 
Now we can. As a consequence of the President's decision to use the line-item veto on a measure designed to help New York, surely there will now be a lawsuit that will persuade the Supreme Court to strike down the measure as unconstitutional. All manner of New Yorkers presumably have standing; they have suffered injury. The Court was explicit that in such a case, the act was open to constitutional challenge. Let the Governor sue. The Comptroller. The Speaker. Mayors. Hospital administrators. Nurses unions. I shall be honored to join in. Expedited judicial review will again be provided pursuant to section 3 of the Line Item Veto Act; the action will again begin in the district court in Washington, with direct appeal to the Supreme Court. This time round, I trust the Court will declare the statute unconstitutional. As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent to the Court's June 26 decision: 
If the [Act] were valid, it would deny every Senator and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the President's cancellation authority. Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it clear that the persons who are deprived of that right by the Act have standing to challenge its constitutionality. . . [T]he same reason that the respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional. 
Once the constitutional issue is disposed of, and even if it is not, and very possibly before it is, I know my colleague from New York will join me in saying that the issue of the equity of the Medicaid matching formula must be addressed. It is too extreme an example of discrimination to go on for another half century. Three years ago, President Clinton said as much. On a visit to New York City in May 1994, he spoke at a breakfast of the Association for a Better New York. Inviting questions, the President was asked by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall whether anything would be done to relieve the State of the `crushing burden' imposed by Medicaid. The President replied: 
There's no question that the formula should be changed, and that states like New York with high per capita incomes but huge numbers of poor people are not treated fairly under a formula that only deals with per capita income. 
There was no reference to this in the President's recent veto message of the New York provision. Rather, the contrary: 
No other state in the nation would be given this provision, and it is unfair to the rest of our nation's taxpayers to ask them to subsidize it. 
This was not entirely accurate, although there is no reason to suppose the President was aware of this. In the absurdly dense 1,600-page bill Congress had sent him, there was a small provision, adopted in the Finance Committee, which raises the Medicaid matching level for Alaska from the bottom rate of 50 percent to the national average of 59.6 percent. The Senators from Alaska made the simple case that the cost of living in Alaska is well above the national average. This is reflected in higher incomes, which the Medicaid formula wrongly interprets as greater wealth. They asked for nothing more than the national average. The District of Columbia got an increased match rate as well. Hawaii asked also, but the bill had been closed by then. Senator D'Amato and I say it is time to open the issue up. 
The case for legislative remedy is surely overwhelming. And we intend to use the new attention that has been drawn to this issue by the President's veto to press that case at every opportunity.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I just congratulate my colleague and friend for the tone of his statement, its tenor. He is not seeking confrontation with the administration. He is seeking insurance for the poorest of poor children in our State. I was able to say earlier that in the annual balance of payments study that we have been putting out for 2 years, New York has the third highest poverty rate in the Nation and the fourth highest cost of living. These children are at stake. 
The Senator has made the point, and I congratulate the Senator for it, in that mode and making clear because the record is there that this issue was never raised prior to the veto. It was a decision made after the bill was signed, I think. I don't know. And I think that some reassessment of the process, the procedure might bring change in judgment. 
Again, I thank my friend, and I am telling him how pleased and honored I am to be associated with him in this matter.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the major league baseball season does not end for another month, but today is the end of the regular season of the New York Penn short-season A League. 
I am very proud to congratulate two teams for making the playoffs, the Batavia Clippers and, closer to my home in Pindars Corners, the Oneonta Yankees. Oneonta is this year's winner of the New York Penn's Pickney Division, with the second best record in the league. Led by hitting stars such as third baseman Alan Butler and catcher/designated hitter Rene Pinto, behind the pitching of Scott Wiggins and Zach Day, and with the support of the rest of the team which played outstanding baseball this year, the Oneonta Yankees had their best season in 7 years and are going to the playoffs for the first time since 1990. 
The Oneonta Yankees have a tradition of success and excellence, having won the New York Penn league title 11 times in their 30 years of existence. The team has been affiliated with the world champion New York Yankees for longer than any other minor-league club in the Yankee organization. Several of today's Yankee stars, including Bernie Williams and Andy Pettitte, began their careers in Oneonta. Don Mattingly--affectionately referred to by the cognoscenti as `Donnie Baseball'--whose number 23 was just retired at a ceremony at Yankee Stadium this past weekend, also played for the Oneonta Yankees. 
As the season ends and the playoffs begin, I want to extend my congratulations to Sam Nader, team owner; Joe Arnold, team manager; and the entire Oneonta Yankees team. I also want to wish them and the Batavia Clippers the best of luck in the post season.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the distinguished Senator from Wyoming have the goodness to remain on the floor for a moment--I know he has a party conference to go to--just to allow me to congratulate him on his remarks. 
Two of the programs he mentioned, the Job Corps and Head Start, it happens I was a member of the Kennedy-Johnson administration. I was an Assistant Secretary of Labor and was on the group that put together the Economic Opportunity Act in 1964 which led to Head Start and to the Job Corps. These are not new initiatives. They go back now a third of a century. I didn't mean to think of myself as that ancient already. 
It is the case, sir, that we have had very little evaluation, very little longitudinal evaluation, where we follow things over time--persons who entered the Job Corps in the 1960's will now be getting into their own fifties--and what has been the result cumulative, one way or the other. This is not something very attractive to governments that live on 2-year cycles, 4-year cycles and, at most, 6-year cycles, yet if we want to do something about these matters we ought to attend them in exactly the mode the Senator spoke of. This can be done. 
The mathematics, if you like, of evaluation have been very much in place since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the Coleman study. It was called an equality of educational opportunity in which we learned great things which surprised us. We thought we knew all about education in those days and we found out we knew very little. I am not sure we have learned much since. 
I take the opportunity to thank the Senator from Wyoming for what he has said, and I hope he will stay with the issue.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have the honor now to respond to my revered chairman, who brought this extraordinary legislation to the floor and in a very few hours from now will see it sent to the President to become law. 
By day's end, the U.S. Senate will have voted overwhelmingly to reduce Federal taxes by a net total of $95 billion over 5 years and $275 billion over 10 years. Whatever one's view of this legislation as a matter of tax policy, there can be absolutely no doubt that without the dominant influence of the chairman of the Committee on Finance, we would not be here today. Absent Senator Roth, we would not be here today. This conference agreement is a singular achievement for him, and we congratulate him. 
Among other provisions in the legislation, the Roth IRA will soon be as well-known as the Pell grant. It is a fitting tribute to Senator Roth's long, persistent, indomitable commitment to encourage savings by Americans. 
For those interested, this is in section 302, Individual Retirement Accounts, section 408(a), Roth IRAs. It is there in what I think others across the park in the Supreme Court call black letter law. There, sir, it is. 
There is another aspect of this legislation which has not been commented on and, I hope, might be. Without perhaps entirely intending it, and not quite in the mode of how others have done it, after a half century of discussion, we are, in fact, establishing a children's allowance in our social policies. 
I have had occasion to write about this over the years. We are the only industrial democracy in the world that does not have a children's allowance--just a routine thing, a feature of social policy that goes back to the beginnings of the century. It had various motivations in Sweden. There was a time when the Swedes thought they were dying out as a race and needed to encourage more children. So they gave family allowances. Sometimes called a family allowance. The French much the same. In places like Canada, just a good social policy. 
During World War II, the late Senator Neuberger was working on the Alaska-Canada highway--ALCAN highway, as we knew it in those days--and interested in what the Canadians were doing, came upon the family allowance, the children's allowance, and introduced legislation when he became Senator after the war. And John F. Kennedy was much interested in this and cosponsored the legislation. 
And I can say from the days of the early Kennedy administration there was an active interest in this possibility--the elemental proposition that if you have children, it is going to cost money, and a family raising children needs a little support. We are giving it. Instead of a direct grant, we are providing a direct tax credit. The end result will be the same, and a rather extraordinary bit of social policy is before us which has never been debated as such, but as I get on in years I begin to think the more you debate social policy, the less social policy you get, and so we could perhaps count our blessings in this regard. 
But now my friend from Delaware has heard his ranking member say on many occasions that if it were up to this Senator, we would have no tax cuts at this time, given the extraordinary condition of our economy just now, a condition for which many believe the deficit reduction law enacted in 1993, OBRA 1993, is largely responsible. 
I continue to be concerned about whether cutting taxes might undo the astonishing progress we have made over the last 4 years, because OBRA 93 took hold when we did it. It was, indeed, the largest tax increase in history, and it has produced extraordinary increases in wealth in our Nation because it sent a signal to the economy that this Government was going to get hold of its financing, pay its bills in sound dollars, not monetize the debt, as the phrase is among economists, inflate the currency and get rid of your debt in that mode. Those are profoundly important signals to the markets, and we have seen, I believe, the result. 
The deficit for fiscal year 1992 was $290 billion and growing. It was strangling us. We had no prospect whatever of getting out of it. What earlier on, President Reagan's Director of OMB, David Stockman, had said, $100 billion deficits as far as the eye can see, had become $300 billion deficits as far as the eye could see. And we turned it around. We stopped it. 
As a result of this aggressive deficit reduction program put in place by a Democratic Congress in 1993, the deficit for the current fiscal year could be less than $30 billion, which is about one-third of 1 percent of gross domestic product, a matter of no consequence in the large sphere of things. The Federal budget is on the verge of balance at this very moment and for the first time in three decades, and it would get there without any changes in law. I would estimate that we might have a balanced budget in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal year, a year from now. We would have it without change in law. Now we are putting the date off until the year 2002. I hope that does not become a fateful mistake. I am not here to alarm anyone, but I think it needs to be said for the record if the time comes when we have to make changes. Given the previous success of our action 4 years ago, we may come to regret what we have done today, but there is not a majority for that view. There is a very small minority for that view. The congressional leadership and the President have agreed that there will be tax cuts this year, and so, given that reality, I joined with the other Democratic members of the Finance Committee in working with Chairman Roth in a bipartisan mode. 
He has been generous enough to point out, as did earlier in the day the majority leader, that the Finance Committee was unanimous in reporting out the measure that we voted on just an hour ago on spending, and there was an 18 to 2 vote in our Committee on the bill before us now. 
Yesterday, Senator Domenici, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, said it was the bipartisan solidarity of the Finance Committee which gave the real impetus to getting the budget agreement put in place, and I think that is so and nothing, no further tribute is possible to Senator Roth for having presided over that event. 
It is a phenomenon which I hope, and I know he hopes, we might see in the future. We found that we could do things on a bipartisan basis that could amaze you. We could raise taxes on tobacco. We could provide the largest incremental initiative in health care since Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in 1965--just like that, just in 2 days. Again, perhaps because it was not debated for a year, we were able to get it done in an afternoon. I would like to explore that possibility sometime. Is there an inverse ratio between the amount of debate and the legislation that emerges? I think you have seen some of that in the past many years. 
I would take the time of the Senate to point to several measures in the bill which are surely praiseworthy and equally important. One that has not been commented on anywhere that I have seen in the press is that the bill before us removes the present $150 million cap on the issuance of tax-exempt bonds by universities, colleges and nonhospital health facilities. It sounds like an esoteric matter. What could this mean? Well, it goes to something that is as important to American life as anything I know, and it is as characteristic of American democracy as anything I know. 
We are the only democratic nation in the world that has a private sector in its higher education--not just a few Jesuit colleges here or every so often a special arrangement in the north of Sweden or the south of France, and so forth. No, our system of higher education began as private denominational matters, and we continue to have just about an equal balance between the great private institutions and the great public institutions. You could go out to California, in the San Francisco Bay area, and you would see it is exemplary of Stanford University, named for a great railroad magnate who gave his money in the name of his son who died prematurely, and Berkeley, the University of California at Berkeley, a great State institution. 
Now, we have earlier on enabled the private universities, colleges, and nonmedical health facilities to borrow money on a tax-exempt basis, which puts them partially on an equal footing with the State institutions which obtain money directly from the taxpayers, from tax revenue, and can issue tax-exempt bonds because they are public institutions. 
We capped that amount, and more and more of our institutions have reached it. And having done that, they are no longer in a position to build what you could call the capital-intensive science facilities and suchlike facilities that you need in the area of research on the edges of knowledge in this country today. And we are the center of such research. You could hypothesize, if you like, a future where if we did not do what we are doing, there would come a time when the finest law school on the west coast would be at Stanford--law schools are not expensive; you have to add 50 books a year in the library--but all the physics would be done at Berkeley. Physics is expensive. All the chemistry, all the great research in astronomy, the outer edges of the universe to the very core of the Earth itself, all that would be in public institutions. And the competitive urges and the range of variety of the private institutions--the University of Chicago, Rice University, go right down the list of them--that would be lost. The University of Pennsylvania, New York University, Columbia and, as I say, across the Nation, those institutions are precious. There is no reason why Americans should know that the universities and colleges in the United Kingdom are all public institutions, but it is important to know that we are singular in this regard, and this legislation responds to that need. It may just be that no one is interested enough to care, to take note, but I can assure you the universities involved are very attentive and are very pleased. 
We also extend for 3 years the provision for exclusion from income of employer-provided educational assistance, which is section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. This is a wonderfully unintrusive piece of social policy. It is probably the single-most successful tax incentive for education we have. In a world of continuing education, of continuing developments in science and technology, we have arrangements whereby an employer can send an employee to school to learn something special being taught--at night or weekends, whatever--get a degree, bring the skills back into the workplace. They will be paid more money, and they will get more income. We will get more revenue. Everyone wins all around. We in the Finance Committee made this absolutely easy, workable, a successful program. We made it permanent. 
For reasons I cannot understand, and I don't think the chairman could possibly understand either, the Finance Committee language, which made it permanent and applied it to graduate school, was dropped in conference. We had legislation in the Senate to do just this, Senator Roth and I, with 50 cosponsors. What is the matter with people who can't see what elemental good sense this makes? The firm that wants to send a chemist to do postgraduate work in a new field that is just opening up so he can come back and do it in the private sector of the economy is just so elemental. That it was not done is disturbing. Perhaps we will get back to it. I can't imagine why it was not accepted, but we had no success. 
The conferees included another salutary measure by extending for 1 year the deductibility, at fair market value, of charitable gifts of appreciated stock to private foundations. Absent this, we would have seen a needless dropoff in charitable giving. And, again, we are trying to encourage the private sector, that private sector of education we try to support, the private sector of employer-provided educational assistance, into giving to private charities. 
Now, to another matter of concern--of large concern--just beginning to be noted. I observed in the Washington Post this morning a comment on it, and also in the New York Times. 
The Senate-passed bill included a measure written by our chairman and supported by this Senator and others to provide $2.3 billion in critically needed funding for Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, the last hope of rail passenger service in America. The distinguished CEO of the corporation, Mr. Tom Downs, said to me, as he would say to anyone who called and asked, that if he did not get this $2.3 billion, the corporation would be bankrupt in February or March. 
I say to you, Mr. President, that's what this period will be remembered for, that we did not do this. We had it in the bill. The Senate voted 80 to 18 for the provision that the chairman provided. And it was dropped. It was dropped owing to a dispute over other matters altogether--job protections and outside contracting by Amtrak. It is provided in this bill that $2.3 billion is there, but it is not available to Amtrak until some very controversial legislation is adopted making job protection and such like matters subject to collective bargaining. 
I will be blunt. This could mean the end of Amtrak, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. Bankruptcy for Amtrak is an outcome we should surely do everything in our power to prevent. It would be a national calamity. I wish to be emphatic in saying that the possibility is now real, and I hope the administration will join in the effort to bring about a resolution. 
I was surprised, in the often intense debates of this last week on this matter, that nowhere did we hear from the Secretary of Labor. Nowhere did we hear from the Secretary of Transportation. What do we have Cabinet officers for? I don't mean to be critical of any individual. It occurs to me that they were not invited in. I'll tell you, I was once an assistant to Secretary Arthur J. Goldberg when he was Secretary of Labor during the Kennedy administration. We had rail strikes and soon thereafter, in the Johnson administration, disputes in the steel industry. Arthur J. Goldberg would have been right in the middle of it, seeing that workers were protected and that the public was protected. 
This remains to be done. I hope I have sounded an alarm. If I sound alarmist, Mr. President, may I put it in the Record that I am and I intend to be alarmist. 
Another matter on which we have made an error, in my view, was the hurtful provision revoking the tax-exempt status of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association and the College Retirement Equities Fund, known as the TIAA-CREF, a 2-million-member retirement system that serves 6,100 American colleges, universities, teaching hospitals, museums, libraries and other nonprofit educational and research institutions. TIAA was founded by Andrew Carnegie in 1918. It has been tax exempt ever since. It is a nonprofit charity, and properly not taxed. 
In 1937 it was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York to `forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the teaching profession'--`forward the cause of education and promote the welfare of the teaching profession.' The law further states that the purpose of TIAA--this is the New York statute--is `to aid and strengthen non-proprietary and non-profit-making colleges, universities and other institutions engaged primarily in education or research.' And it has done just that. It has long been recognized as a model of such programs. 
As a somewhat unanticipated result, it brought to American higher education portability of pensions. You did not have to start out in one institution and after a certain point stay the rest of your life because you had to have some retirement benefit. It has a great value to our educational system for the simple reason that it enables a young person at, say, a 2-year college or a local college, who shows great promise, does good work, to end up at Chicago or Stanford or Duke, because they can move. This is part of the agility of American higher education. There is no reason to tax this, and the Finance Committee said don't tax it. We never have. The Senate said don't tax it. But somehow or other we have decided to do so. 
Revoking TIAA-CREF's 79-year-old tax exemption will cost the average retiree who receives $12,000 a year about $600 in income. You know, librarians are not highly paid. Perhaps that is not widely known. A $12,000 pension would be quite normal. A $600 reduction would be 5 percent right away. Future retirees currently accumulating benefits are likely to face reductions of 10 to 15 percent. 
Why make the lives of librarians and assistant professors and teachers in community colleges harder? Why do we do this? Why wasn't this something that people said no to? The Finance Committee said no to it. But we were not successful. 
Two closing points. In an era in which the most recent Presidential campaign was captivated--at least sectors of it--by the idea of a flat tax, it deserves pointing out that this 820-page piece of legislation will add hugely to the stupefying complexity and mass of the Internal Revenue Code and its accompanying regulations. 
Mr. President, this is not an exercise here in physical therapy. For as long as I can, I would like to hold it up to show it to you. I dare not hold it up any longer. If I should drop it, there would go my right ankle. Did that thump on the desk make itself heard? 
In 1986, in the Tax Reform Act of that year, we moved toward the idea of simplicity in the Tax Code by a broader base and lower rates. Just an anecdote, the late beloved Erwin Griswold, sometime dean of the Harvard Law School, sometime Solicitor General of the United States, was a friend. He used to write me each April describing how long it took him to complete his tax returns, which he persisted in preparing himself. Now, mind you, Dean Griswold was perhaps the Nation's foremost authority on the subject of tax law. He almost began the subject. He wrote the first text. He describes himself as being a young attorney, graduate of Harvard Law in the 1920s, in the Solicitor General's office, and some matters concerning taxation came to him. He, as he put it in a wonderful address to the bar association tax section, said, `I thought of going to the Solicitor General to tell him I didn't know anything about tax law, but I decided to go to the library instead.' And he wrote the text. 
In his last letter to me, dated April 12, 1994, 7 months before he died, he wrote that his 1993 tax return took him almost 100 hours to complete--100 hours for Erwin Griswold to prepare his not very complicated financial affairs. He was a teacher and a lawyer, Government employee, and he knew all these matters--yet it took him 100 hours. It would be 110 were he alive into the next tax season. 
Let me say, just as an example, a family with three children, two in college and one under age 17, could be required to calculate the new child tax credit, a Hope scholarship tax credit for one college student, and a separate lifelong learning credit for the older child. Each of these different provisions will have different eligibility rules and complicated income phaseouts that will have to be calculated on different worksheets and reported to the Internal Revenue Service on a variety of forms. 
It is no exaggeration, sir--I don't believe it is an exaggeration--to say that anybody who could fill out the forms necessary to qualify for these tax benefits would already be an accountant of advanced experience and achievement and would have no need for the benefits. 
I do want to point out that in the statement of the managers accompanying this conference report, it says, `The conferees anticipate that the Secretary of the Treasury will determine whether a simplified method of calculating the child credit, consistent with the formula described above, can be achieved.' So there is hope. But I wouldn't hope too much. 
President Ronald Reagan, our much-loved President Ronald Reagan, liked to say the Republicans are the party of the Fourth of July and Democrats are the party of April 15th. With the passage of this legislation, I think Democrats can no longer take all the credit for April 15th. 
A second and final point. This will be the first-ever tax bill subject to the line-item veto, which gives the President, `limited authority to cancel specific dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority, certain new direct spending, and limited tax benefits.' 
Limited tax benefits are those that provide, a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or preference to 100 or fewer beneficiaries. 
In January of this year, I joined Senators Byrd, Levin and former Senator Hatfield in a legal challenge to the line-item veto on grounds that it violates the presentment clause in article I, section 7, of the Constitution. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia agreed and promptly declared the statute unconstitutional. 
But later, on June 26, the Justice Department took the matter to the Supreme Court itself, and the Court held that we, as legislators, had no standing to challenge the law, clearing the way for the President to exercise his new authority. 
Now, just 2 days ago, on July 29, the Joint Committee on Taxation met to consider the list of limited tax benefits in this bill, a list prepared by the committee staff, that would be subject to the line-item veto. It was the first time we had done this under the new law, and I am pleased to report, upon being presented with the 6-page list totaling 79 separate provisions in this bill subject to the line-item veto, some members of the joint committee began to display a visible lessening of enthusiasm for the concept itself.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, under the Taxpayer's Relief Act of 1997, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association [TIAA] and the College Retirement Equities Fund [CREF] are taxed under the same regime as life insurance companies. However, TIAA and CREF are separate companies with different structures and operations. 
TIAA is a nonprofit, legal reserve life insurance and annuity company. CREF, on the other hand, is a management investment company registered with the SEC under the 1940 act. CREF was organized in 1952 under a special act of the New York Legislature. CREF predates the existence of separate accounts and in fact served as the model for the variable annuity products offered today by life insurance companies through separate accounts. No portion of a participant's pension contribution to CREF pays for guarantees or the maintenance of reserves. 
In light of the differences between TIAA and CREF, I would like to ask Chairman Roth, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee if he would be so kind as to comment on the intent of the bill as it applies to the taxation of CREF.

Furthermore, these bonds will not be taken into account with respect to other qualified section 501(C)(3) bonds that are subject to the $150 million limitation, which bonds may continue to be issued on a tax-exempt basis to finance and refinance expenditures as permitted under existing law.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Acid Deposition Control Act of 1997, a bill to combat acid rain and help restore health to the Nation's sensitive ecosystems--such as the Adirondack Park in my home State of New York. My friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato is cosponsor of this measure. 
Mr. President, in the 1960's, fishermen in the Adirondacks began to complain about more than the big ones that got away. Fish, once abundant, were not simply becoming harder to catch. They had disappeared. Initially, pollution seemed an unlikely cause. The lakes lie in a park protected by the New York State Constitution from most disturbances by human activities. Most of the lakes are virtually inaccessible, except to fishermen--and the winds that blow in from industrial pockets across the Midwest. 
Before long, pioneering scientists such as Cornell University's Eugene Likens and Carl Schofield and Syracuse University's Charles Driscoll established a link between increased deposition of acidic compounds in rainfall and the absence or deformity of fish in lakes with clear water and low pH. 
This was precisely the phenomenon first documented by Robert Angus Smith in Manchester, England, in 1852. More recently, acid rain had been of concern in Scandinavia. Acids lofted into the atmosphere from tall smokestacks in the industrial basin of the Ruhr River, falling on watersheds that were, in many places, little more than bare rock. Closer to the source, acid rain was blamed for Waldsterben, the death of Germany's prized Black Forest. 
We have learned a great deal since then. In June 1980, Congress passed the Energy Security Act, Public Law 96-264. Title VII consisted of a bill I introduced in 1979, the Acid Precipitation Act of 1980. It established the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program [NAPAP]--an interagency research program to foster the development of science-based Federal policy regarding acid rain. This program resulted in the establishment of long-term acid deposition monitoring programs, a network of permanent forest plots and lake sampling regimes, over 1,500 peer reviewed publications, and perhaps more important the issuance of 71 doctoral degrees in acid deposition research during the 1980's compared to only 2 in the decade before. 
By the end of this massive study, scientists worldwide gathered in South Carolina to discuss what they had learned. They learned that at least 800 lakes and 2,200 streams in the eastern United States had been made acidic by acid rain; they predicted that an additional 10 percent would become acidic over the next decade without additional legislation. And they confirmed--as had been expected--that sulfur dioxide emissions were found to be a significant factor in acidifying ecosystems. Sulfur dioxide had contributed to forest decline in high elevation areas, corrosion of stone and metal structures, and reduced visibility. 
In 1990, Congress enacted acid rain controls to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons below 1985 levels, utilizing a unique, market-based approach to ensure the most cost-effective pollution reduction possible. At the time, the measure was expected to have some noticeable--but not overwhelming--beneficial effects. 
We were right. Visibility has increased. Acidification of lake waters and deterioration of materials has been reduced. The incidence of respiratory disease has decreased. The market-based emissions trading approach has proved a tremendous success, fostering reductions nearly 40 percent beyond that which the act required, at costs amounting to a mere fraction of industry and government predictions. Equally important, our knowledge increased. 
In recent years, scientists have identified another important precursor of acid rain: nitrogen oxides. Studies on the combined effect of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide strongly suggest that the Clean Air Act will not be adequate to prevent long-term deterioration of national treasures such as the Adirondack Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay. According to a 1995 Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] study, even with the reductions required by the Clean Air Act, up to 45 percent of the lakes in the Adirondacks will become too acidic to support most aquatic life by the year 2040. Lakes too acidic to support life. Now there is a powerful image. 
The bill I introduce today requires an additional 50-percent reduction of sulfur dioxide and a 75-percent reduction in the level of nitrogen oxides emitted from electric utilities. This legislation blends the best judgment of top scientists with the successful, market-based approach of the existing program. 
The legislation calls for a nitrogen oxide cap and trade program similar to the sulfur dioxide program presently administered by EPA's Acid Rain Division. Under the program, EPA officials would divide a fixed--capped--number of nitrogen oxide emission allowances among the 48 contiguous States each year, basing each State's share of allowances on the State's share of the power generated within the 48 States. 
Each State, in turn, would divide the allowances among the utilities within the State, in whatever manner the State sees fit. Each allowance represents a limited right to emit 1 ton of NOX pollution. Each utility must conduct an accounting procedure to ensure that they hold enough allowances to cover their emissions tonnage. A utility with more allowances than emissions may sell their additional allowances or save them for use in a future year. Likewise, a utility with fewer allowances than emissions would purchase excess allowances from another source. 
If for any reason a State does not wish to administer the allocation of allowances to its utilities, the EPA Administrator will distribute the allowances automatically, giving each utility a share of the State's allowances equal to that utility's share of the State's power generation. 
In addition to contributing to acid deposition, NOX pollution contributes to ozone pollution, a respiratory and pulmonary irritant which can cause significant adverse health effects. Because heat and sunlight are necessary components in the creation of ozone pollution, ozone is most prevalent in warm summer months. Therefore, in an effort to reduce ozone pollution, the legislation would take additional measures to reduce summertime NOX emissions. During the months of May, June, July, August, and September, an electric utility would be forced to surrender two allowances per ton of NOX emitted. 
The NOX trading program would commence operation on January 1, 2000, beginning with an annual cap of 5.4 million allowances and cutting back to 3.0 million allowances beginning in 2003. EPA modeling suggests that, due to the two-for-one ozone season emissions provision, the actual emissions will likely drop to approximately 2.3 million tons per year after 2003--a reduction of approximately 70 percent from 1995 levels. 
Mr. President, there were days when dark plumes of smoke coming out of factory smokestacks were signs of prosperity. There was nothing Jim Farley liked to do better than put up a new Post Office and hire an artist to paint on its walls prosperity returning. Black columns of smoke reaching up to the sky--strong colors for what we hoped would be a strong economy. 
Lord Kelvin used to point out that one can't solve a problem that one cannot measure. We have spent decades measuring, and now it is time to update our policy response in order to solve the problem. It is time to adjust to the consequences of what we have learned. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Acid Deposition Control Act of 1997.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with a distinguished group of my colleagues to introduce the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Technology Deployment Act of 1997. 
Maglev is the first new transportation technology envisioned since the development of aviation in the early 1900's, and its adoption represents an opportunity for dramatic national gains in transportation efficiency and economic growth. This legislation proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of Maglev by authorizing limited Federal participation in financing one or more Maglev projects in the United States. 
Maglev is an advanced technology in which magnetic forces lift, propel, and guide a vehicle over a guideway. Utilizing state-of-the-art electric power and control systems, this configuration eliminates the need for wheels and many other mechanical parts, thereby minimizing friction and permitting cruising speeds of 300 miles per hour or more--three times the speed of conventional American train technology. Because of its high speeds and relatively modest right-of-way requirements, Maglev offers significant advantages over auto, rail, and aviation modes in 40- to 600-mile travel markets. Maglev is also a very safe technology since properly designed Maglev is virtually impossible to derail. 
While Maglev was invented by a young American nuclear engineer in the 1960's, the Germans have developed the technology and have already built a demonstration Maglev test facility. They are now proceeding with a public/private project to construct a 181-mile Maglev system to connect Berlin to Hamburg. The German system, which is expected to be operational by 2005, will provide 1-hour service between the two cities. Not far behind Germany, Japan has its own Maglev system under test. Meanwhile, our Federal Government has done relatively little to develop this extraordinary technology. 
In the last few years, however, the Federal Rail Administration has identified the feasibility of deployment of Maglev systems in several major U.S. transportation corridors. Also, several public/private partnerships in the United States have begun to develop Maglev projects in a number of States, including California, Florida, Maryland, and Nevada. However, as with our European and Asian competitors, developing these Maglev projects will require Federal support to supplement the private and other public funding sources. Our bill would establish a competition for Federal funds, based on economic and financial criteria, among the various public/private Maglev project partnerships. 
Because Maglev is a proven technology that offers significant benefits for both passengers and freight, it is in the National interest to demonstrate these benefits by proceeding to construct and put into service, at an early date, a project in the United States. This legislation will encourage such a project at minimum public cost.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to honor and remember a truly exceptional American, Ronald H. Brown. The bill would designate the newly constructed Federal building located at 290 Broadway in the heart of lower Manhattan as the `Ronald H. Brown Federal Building.' 
It is a fitting gesture to recognize the passing of this remarkable American, and I would ask for my colleagues' support for this legislation to place one more marker in history on Ron Brown's behalf. 
Ron Brown had a great love for enterprise and industry as reflected in his achievements as the first African-American to hold the office of U.S. Secretary of Commerce. His was also a life of outstanding achievement and public service: Army captain; vice president of the National Urban League; partner in a prestigious law firm; chairman of the National Democratic Committee; husband and father. And these are but a few of the achievements that demonstrated Ron Brown's spirited and sweeping pursuit of life. 
To have held any one of these posts in the government, and in the private sector, is extraordinary. To have held all of the positions he did and prevail as he did, is unique. Ron Brown was tragically taken from us too soon; we are diminished by his loss. I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to this uncommon man.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this conference report comes before the Senate in an atmosphere of near euphoria. While I have signed the conference report--I was a Democratic conferee from the Finance Committee on these matters--and while I will vote for each of the bills, I cannot share the elation. I say this with the greatest respect for the Senators who managed this through the Budget Committee and, of course, for our own revered chairman of the Finance Committee--Senator Roth--and others who have worked so very hard on the legislation. Surely, there is much to applaud in both bills. But the agreement does little to address, in a serious way, either short run or long-run budget problems. 
In the short-run, the Federal budget is already on the verge of balance. This is due to a strong 7-year economic expansion. The expansion is attributable, in part--very probably in large part--to the budget decisions made by the President and this side of the aisle in the Senate in 1993. Indeed, my respected colleague, Bob Kerrey, suggests that the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 be renamed the Balanced Budget Act of 1993. The deficit reduction brought about by OBRA 93, as our usage has it, is expected to reduce the deficit by a cumulative $924 billion through 1998. That is almost a trillion dollars. 
I stood on the floor at this desk, with my great and good friend, Senator Sasser, as the chairman of the Budget Committee at that desk. I was chairman of the Finance Committee. In the end, we enacted that measure by one vote, which has brought us to where we are today. I don't know that the Nation, having heard so much for so long about deficits, had been properly concerned about them so much and for so long. It is not easy to grasp the possibility that the deficit for this fiscal year, which will end September 30, will come in under $30 billion. That is about one-third of 1 percent of gross domestic product--an insignificant number. If the present trends continue, we could well be in a surplus in a year's time--the first such surplus, if I rightly recall, since 1969. 
And then having reached the point where we have free resources, we would be in a very proper position to turn to questions of, do we want to cut taxes, which clearly we might do? I would much prefer to see tax rates reduced--and I will talk about that tomorrow--or to provide new benefit programs of the kind that we are providing, but not before we have done what we said we would do first, which was to balance the budget. 
Over the long run, too, this legislation does less than many of us on the Finance Committee would have liked. Indeed, I can say, sir, that all of us on the Finance Committee would have liked, as the measure I am referring to, passed unanimously in the Finance Committee, 20 to 0, on June 18. In particular, we chose to confront the long-run issues in Medicare. We are told that our two major retirement programs--Social Security and Medicare--are in grave difficulties. That is not so clear in the case of Social Security. 
Four rather simple steps would bring us into actuarial balance for a full 75 years--the usual way solvency is measured for the Social Security program. It could be done by four simple measures. 
Construct an accurate cost of living index--rather than a consumer price index--in the manner that has been proposed by the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the previous director of the Office of Management and Budget, Dr. Rivlin, and the Boskin Commission established by the Finance Committee when Senator Packwood was chairman--he and I jointly did that. 
Tax Social Security retirement benefits in the way that all other pensions are now taxed. 
Include all workers in the Social Security system. To this day, in a kind of exasperating holdover from the 1930's, there are several million State and local government employees who are not in the Social Security system as government employees, but who acquire the benefits, in any event, through part-time work outside. 
Increase the computation period from 35 to 38 years. 
Just take those four measures, and a few other odd things, and we put Social Security in fine fiscal condition into the second half of the next century. 
This is not the case with Medicare. Medicare is a health program, and it provides health care to a population that grows older and does so in the setting where medical science grows ever more successful in the treatment of the diseases associated with aging. But those treatments are, of necessity, ever more expensive. There is a true problem in Medicare. We have made many changes in the present program, so as to provide another 10 years of trust fund solvency. But in fact, sir, since 1992, the revenues from the Medicare payroll taxes have not equaled the outlays. And we have used general revenues to fund the shortfall, and since the Federal budget has been in a deficit situation, we have had to borrow money to do it. We can say, if you like, that we have 10 years of solvency. There is not now and there won't be until we do very important things. 
We began that effort in the Finance Committee on June 18. We took the decision to increase the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 years to 67, in very gradual steps over the next quarter century, and bringing it into line with the increased age of eligibility for Social Security benefits, provisions adopted in 1983 in the aftermath of a commission, headed by Dr. Greenspan, on which Senator Dole and I served, among others. That measure just responds to the age profile, the demographic profile of the American people. We are living longer. And I would say, Mr. President, also, while we are living longer, we are retiring earlier. The majority of Americans now retire at age 62, when a reduced benefit on Social Security is available, and some 70 percent have retired by age 65. It is not entirely clear why. Some have sufficient resources and they simply want to stop working, and others have not gotten work, or others find the work no longer possible for them. But the fact is that most people now are retired before age 65, and on actuarially reduced benefits, so the trust funds are left unaffected. We proposed to do that with Medicare. 
If there is a problem of interim insurance from the time you leave employment to the time you are retired, well, we can resolve that problem. We could be thinking about it right now, in terms of those who retire early on Social Security. The problem of health care insurance does not deter, so far as we can tell, persons from doing that. It is not an admirable fact; it is a distressful fact that the last time the Social Security Administration did a survey asking persons the reasons why they retired early was about 15 years ago. The Social Security Administration is very slow in providing the kind of information we would like to have to make these decisions. 
We also, in the Finance Committee, unanimously agreed to increase the part B premiums for upper-income beneficiaries. That is to say, to reduce the part of the Medicare Program paid for by general revenues. When the program was begun--and I was involved if not peripherally, but with some measure of consequence as an Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy Planning and Research in the Johnson administration--we provided that this program, Part B, should be paid for half by premiums paid by beneficiaries and half by general revenues. Over the years, as a technical result of having constrained the increase in premiums to the same percentage increase in Social Security benefits, while the cost of medical care increased faster than the consumer price index--which itself was an inadequate measure of the cost of living--that 50/50 share dropped to 25 percent for beneficiaries and 75 percent for the Government. 
We would simply provide that persons with higher incomes would pay more than the simple 25 percent that the great majority of persons would pay. We are talking about a very small number of people--about 6 percent of all beneficiaries--but the principle is that if you have the income, you don't need the subsidy. Indeed, the overall subsidy would still be much greater than it was originally envisaged in 1965--with the Federal Government financing 72 percent of program costs out of general revenues. The time has come to do that. 
Equally, the time has come to provide some measure of copayment for home health care, which has been growing at extraordinary rates, and which is evidently subject to serious abuse. 
This was widely reported in the press just this week. These items have come to be known as the big three Medicare changes. They were adopted on June 25 here on the Senate floor by a vote of 73 to 27. However, they are not included in the conference agreement. The House was not willing to do this, and I can only regret that we have not done so. I stand here and say, however, that the Senate has led the way and has shown you can do it. The response in public opinion has been quite moderate. The comment in the press has been almost unvaryingly supportive. 
These are necessary, sensible things to do. And it is time we set about doing them. There is an opportunity that we will not miss, particularly if the Finance Committee--under the leadership of Chairman Roth--continues to work in a bipartisan manner. 
About 80 percent of the savings in mandatory programs in this bill before us, this extraordinary large bill--I would hate to see it dropped on anyone's foot--about 80 percent of those savings came from actions by the Finance Committee. The 5-year savings for Medicare are $115 billion. That is a decrease in the increase, in a manner we have come to be familiar with, and, as I have said, the trust fund will be in technical balance for about 10 years. 
This does buy us time for an important provision in the bill, the provision for the creation of a national bipartisan commission on the future of Medicare--time for such commission to do its work. The statute provides that it issue its report by March 1, 1999, a year and a half from now. 
The commission is required, in the first instance, to review and analyze the long-term financial condition of the Medicare Program, which is not an easy matter because we are talking about the long-term progress of medicine in an age of discovery that has proved extraordinarily creative and fruitful but equally and not unsurprisingly costly, and to identify the problems that threaten the financial integrity of Medicare, including the extent to which Medicare update indexes do not accurately reflect inflation. 
If I could say parenthetically, Mr. President, we have had a great deal of talk about the accuracy, or inaccuracy, or sufficiency, or insufficiency of the Consumer Price Index. The fact is, we have at least four distinct price indexes in our present statutes and in our practices. They are spread all over the Government. One of them indexes Medicare expenses in ways that it seems to me probably overstate inflation. 
Next the commission is asked to make recommendations regarding the financing of graduate medical education, including consideration of alternative broad-based sources of funding for medical education. This could not be a more important matter. The question of medical schools and medical education is absolutely essential as we begin the process of economic rationalization in the provision of health care, as we do in this measure making a wide range of HMO's available to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 
In this regard, Mr. President, might I just go back to 1994 when the Finance Committee was taking up the health care proposal sent to us by the administration in the last days of the first session of the 103d Congress. I was in New York City and asked the distinguished head of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York--Dr. Paul Marks--if he would arrange a seminar to bring me up to date on the thinking of medical deans and medical academic researchers in the area of health care generally. We met one morning in a conference room in January at 10 o'clock. And at about 10:20, one of the deans, who comes from another part of the country, said, `You know, the University of Minnesota may have to close its medical school.' That was said to me and I knew I had heard something important. Minnesota is the kind of State where they open medical schools. They don't close them. I asked, `How could that be?' They said, `Well, managed care is making its way from the west coast to the east coast. It has reached the high plains, and is now widely used in Minnesota.' 
Persons enrolled in managed care plans are not sent to teaching hospitals because they are, by definition, more expensive. If you do not have a teaching hospital, you can't have a medical school. And, indeed, the teaching hospital at the University of Minnesota has since merged with another health care institution. 
We are dealing with something profoundly important. An ancient practice of medicine goes all the way back to the Greeks. The establishment of medicine doesn't go back just to the Greeks, but the idea of a profession of medicine with a code of ethics, a Hippocratic oath, certain responsibilities, certain immutabilities in medicine--something of a mystery, something of a guide. In my youth, doctors would prescribe medicines taken from drugstores in a handwriting that was illegible to the laymen. Only the pharmacist could read it. All of that is disappearing. 
In our hearings in the Finance Committee, Msgr. Charles J. Fahey, a professor at Fordham University said to us, `What you are seeing is a `commodification' of medicine.' There is a striking image here on the Senate floor. For generations, we have argued the issue of whether labor is a commodity. Finally, in the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, we said labor is not a commodity. Well, medicine is becoming one. 
The next week, Dr. Raymond G. Schultze, at the time the head of the UCLA Medical Center volunteered, and said, `Can I give you an example of that?' We were discussing it with our witnesses, saying that is a new idea. He said, `In southern California, we now have a spot market of bone marrow transplants.' Well, when you get into that, that is good. It keeps control on prices. It brings rational decisionmaking into this market. But it doesn't provide for the public good. Markets won't provide for the public good that a teaching hospital and a medical school constitute. 
So our commission must pay special attention to these institutions. 
Finally, we ask the commission to make recommendations on modifying the age of eligibility for Medicare so that it corresponds to the changes in the age of eligibility for Social Security. I would simply suggest that this provision--the instruction to the forthcoming commission to deal with this matter of age of eligibility--obviously reflects the decision in the Finance Committee and the Senate that it ought to be increased to be in harmony with that of Social Security. 
The Medicaid changes in this legislation will save about $10 billion over 5 years by providing greater flexibility to the States, and at the same time, as I have remarked earlier, the Medicaid recipients will be encouraged to participate in HMO's just as Medicare recipients do. When we began Medicaid and Medicare, there were very few arrangements which we now call health maintenance organizations. Fee-for-service medicine was almost the universal experience. So, naturally, when people retired, they continued it, and Medicaid recipients took it up. That has changed with the general population and ought to change with this population as well. 
To the one bit of really strikingly good news in this measure, we have taken action to provide health coverage for uninsured children, $24 billion over 5 years. This will be the largest expansion in Government health insurance since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. We have done something that has not been done in a generation, and something that is needed. It will be financed by an increase in the cigarette tax that will eventually reach 15 cents per pack. Both of these measures were also an initiative of the Senate Finance Committee. 
I would also note that the conference committee, even prior to our commission, includes provisions to ensure an adequate stream of Federal funding for teaching hospitals. Financing of health care continues to undergo dramatic change. We will have a more comprehensive proposal from our commission. But we have done some things in this bill. 
Medicare payments to HMO's now reflect the higher cost of providing care in teaching hospitals. Under the legislation before us, these payments will be carved out, as we say, and sent directly to the teaching hospitals, thereby ensuring that the money will go where it is intended. 
In addition, while payments for medical education have been reduced as part of the overall reduction in payments to hospitals and physicians that are inevitable in a deficit reduction bill, the conference report includes the Senate language which limits the cuts to about $5.5 billion rather than $6.5 billion recommended by the House. 
Again, sir, I would say that had we not decided to go for a large tax increase, which we will talk about tomorrow, we wouldn't have had to make some of these reductions which I think we will find difficult, if not indeed painful. 
Finally, it should be noted that this bill sensibly increases the statutory debt limit from $5.5 trillion to $5.95 trillion, which will be sufficient to take us through December 1999--a much smaller increase would be required if we decided simply to stay the course that we set in 1993. 
So, Mr. President, I will support this conference report. It is the product of a long and difficult effort to reach compromise between the Congress and the President. It was characterized by extraordinary unanimity in the Finance Committee, where 80 percent of the mandatory program reductions are to be found, and by very large majorities here on the Senate floor. 
I think that speaks to the sincerity of the participants and, I hope, to our knowledge. If I consult my hopes in this matter, there is no real alternative. And, in the meantime, we have done some things that we surely can be proud of. 
I see my friend, the Senator from West Virginia, is on the floor. I know what particular pleasure he will take in the provision of $24 billion in health insurance for children, the largest such increase in health care in a generation since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid was done. 
With that, Mr. President, and seeing that there are other Senators present, I yield the floor. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the New York Times reports an important advance in United States diplomacy. Secretary of State Albright has agreed to appoint a special coordinator to oversee American policy toward Tibet. This brings to fruition the vision of our beloved former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Pell, who introduced a bill (S. 2554) at the end of the 103d Congress to establish a position in the Department of State to coordinate United States policy on Tibet. 
Since 1959, the Tibetans have suffered the liberation of their country by the Communist Chinese. Tibet is a remote land. Tibetans at that time had no interest in relations with other countries. No interest in joining the newly formed United Nations. Perhaps if Tibet had, we would have paid more attention when it was invaded. 
Now it's time to pay attention. Most importantly, we must focus on efforts to bring the Tibetans and the Chinese to the negotiating table to resolve their differences. The situation requires far more attention within the administration and a special coordinator can provide appropriate attention. While the Dalai Lama has stated repeatedly his willingness to begin negotiations, the Chinese continue to issue denials. As my daughter Maura wrote in a Washington Post article in April: 
Most policy makers do not realize that the Dalai Lama is not seeking territorial sovereignty for his captive nation; nor is he asking to be reinstated as the head of the theocratic government that ruled Tibet prior to the Chinese invasion. In an address to the European Parliament in 1988 in Strasbourg, France, the Dalai Lama offered the Chinese control of Tibet's military and diplomatic affairs if they would allow the Tibetan people a measure of self-governance and non-interference in religion and culture. 
That is certainly a magnanimous offer. The response from the Chinese? Silence. 
In creating this new position, we make clear that we have heard this reasonable offer and intend to pursue it. As Lodi Gyari, the able diplomat who represents the Dalai Lama in Washington, is quoted in the New York Times today: 
If the United States is consistent and sincere and vigorous in trying to persuade the Chinese Government to come to a settlement, I strongly believe it will happen. 
The new post will also allow closer scrutiny of human rights abuses in Tibet, which continue at an appalling level. I would note, as the author of the provision which resulted in a separate Tibet report in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, that the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, led by Assistant Secretary Shattuck, has done a superb job in documenting the situation in Tibet. The excellent information the Bureau collects will be more readily acted upon by an officer focused solely on Tibet. 
For too long, Tibet has fallen between the cracks of United States foreign policy. Such neglect has led Abe Rosenthal to wonder if Tibetans are not `Endangered Species,' as he asked in the New York Times on May 21, 1994:  
Is anybody protecting, please, another of God's endangered species, which happens to be human, the Tibetans? Not yet. Neither the Republic nor the Empire nor any other nation, great or small, does anything about the Tibetans, except India, which gives them refuge when they can escape their cage. 
Would it help to say that just as there are laws against slaughtering hawksbill turtles, there are international laws against genocide--the elimination of nations and cultures? Probably not. 
This is a rather somber note on which to end, yet the situation in Tibet is grave. I am pleased that the Secretary has decided to appoint a new special coordinator for Tibet and both Congress and the Administration can devote more attention to this `Endangered Species.'

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on July 22, 1997, the Washington Post contained a moving tribute to the Forward, a New York City journalistic tradition currently celebrating its centennial year. 
The Members of the Senate are probably aware of the Forward's magnificent history; this daily Yiddish newspaper once enjoyed a daily circulation of over 250,000. It did its job of helping new arrivals assimilate and become Americans so very well, that its original readers' descendants can now enjoy the newspaper's superb English language edition, while a wave of new immigrants are being introduced to the nuances of American life by the newspaper's Russian edition. 
The Forward's legacy lives on, not only in its three current editions, but with the tens of thousands of families whose ancestors learned about this country in the pages of Abraham Cahan's remarkable publication. On May 22, New York Mayor Guiliani hosted a reception at Gracie Mansion to mark the one- hundredth anniversary of the Daily Vorwaert's first issue. I sent a message to this reception which was reprinted in the Forward's Yiddish, English and Russian editions: 
I have long believed that the Forward renders an invaluable contribution to American society. Your dynamic newspaper should be appreciated by all who cherish our national heritage of respect for intellectual creativity and journalistic integrity. Even those of us who couldn't enjoy A Bintel Brief in the original were long ago aware of the Forward's power to captivate, educate and inspire. Your vigorous English edition is a worthy companion to the historic Yiddish Forward. 
Please accept my great congratulations on this magnificent milestone. 
With my best wishes to the `gold standard' of ethnic journalism. 
The Forward has played a significant cultural and educational role in its first century and I trust that the members of the Senate join me in wishing similar success to the three editions that so ably carry on the historic Forward tradition.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this morning I learned from the mayor of the Village of Owego of a problem he is having with the village's share of the local law enforcement block grant. As we are concluding the debate on the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill today, I thought it might be appropriate to bring the matter to the attention of the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from South Carolina. I intend to pursue the matter with the Justice Department, but I may need to ask their help at some point. 
Mayor Hogan informs me that after recently receiving a letter from the director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance concerning the application process for fiscal year 1997 funds, and while filling out the fiscal year 1997 application, village officials discovered that 1996 funds had been available to them. They had never been notified. A Bureau official then told them that some requests for applications had been sent to incorrect addresses. Village officials contacted the supervisor of the nearby Town of Owego, who remembered receiving the application notice meant for the village. However, the application deadline passed 9 months ago. The village lost out on $10,840 through no fault of its own. 
Mr. President, $10,840 may not seem to be a large sum these days, but for the Village of Owego it is. It constitutes three-quarters of 1 percent of the village tax base. If three-quarters of 1 percent of the total Federal receipts for 1998 were at stake, we would be talking about $11.7 billion, and that would have our attention. I hope the Senators from New Hampshire and South Carolina will consider assisting in this matter if necessary.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, current Supreme Court Justice David Souter captured the legacy of jurisprudence left behind by William J. Brennan Jr., when he said: `Justice Brennan is going to be remembered as one of the most fearlessly principled guardians of the American Constitution that it has ever had and ever will have.' 
In an era when no institution is more embattled than the U.S. Constitution, we must make special note of the passing of such ardent guardians. In a manner that endeared him equally to friend and foe, Justice Brennan matched the importance of his decisions with literary acumen. With language that could be compared to the authors of the Constitution, Justice Brennan guarded the constitutional principles--most especially the freedom to criticize one's government. 
Madison's original version of the first amendment submitted on June 8, 1789, provided that: `The people shall not be deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks of liberty, shall be inviolable.' Justice Brennan's identification of Madison's inviolable protection was crucial during the civil rights movement when members of the press were being figuratively gagged for their criticism of public officials. Thus, Brennan wrote in The New York Times versus Sullivan: 
We consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials. * * * 
A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions--and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount--leads to a comparable `self censorship.' Allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred. * * * 
Under such a rule, would-be critics of official conduct may be deterred from voicing their criticism, even though it is believed to be true and even though it is in fact true, because of doubt whether it can be proved in court or fear of the expense of having to do so. They tend to make only statements which `steer far wider of the unlawful zone.' The rule thus dampens the vigor and limits the variety of public debate. It is inconsistent with the 1st and 14th Amendments. 
In 1789, James Madison warned that, `If we advert to the nature of republican government, we shall find that the censorial power is in the people over the government, and not in the government over the people.' Exactly 200 years later, Brennan expanded this underlying premise of constitutionally protected forms of free expression in the case, Texas versus Johnson, 1989: 
If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. * * * 
There is, moreover, no indication--either in the text of the Constitution or in our cases interpreting it--that a separate juridical category exists for the American flag alone. Indeed, we would not be surprised to learn that the persons who framed our Constitution and wrote the amendment that we now construe were not known for their reverence for the Union Jack. 
The first amendment does not guarantee that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such as the principle that discrimination on the basis of race is odious and destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas. 
We decline, therefore, to create for the flag an exception to the joust of principles protected by the First Amendment. * * * 
The way to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they are wrong * * * We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's own. * * * 
Justice Brennan came to embody the defense of a Madisonian concept of the first amendment. We shall not soon forget his legacy, nor the critical mantle he has left behind.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, throughout this week, hundreds of volunteers will gather together for the annual `On and Under the Delaware River Cleanup' on the upper Delaware River. People from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania will work together to clean up the Delaware River, picking up trash and removing debris from the shores, surface, and bottom of a 70-mile section of the river. Once again, Ruth Jones and the folks at Kittatinny Canoes will lead this effort and supply the boats, cleaning materials, trash removal, and other services needed for the effort. National Park Service employees and a member of my staff will also participate. 
The Delaware River is the longest free-flowing river in the country. It starts in my home county, Delaware County, NY, at the confluence of the east and west branches of the river in Deposit, NY and continues down through Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, ultimately feeding into the Atlantic Ocean. The west branch starts in Stamford, NY, just 25 miles from my home in Pindars Corners. 
This river is one of New York's and the Nation's great treasures. I applaud Ms. Jones for sponsoring this event and thank all the volunteers for their hard work in helping to keep the river clean.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to three Presidents, director of the NAACP, and the first African-American Cabinet Secretary, passed away last week at his home in New York City. Dr. Weaver spent his entire life broadening opportunities for minorities in America. I rise today to pay tribute to this great man. 
Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's `Black Cabinet,' an informal advisory group promoting job and educational opportunities for blacks. The Washington Post called this work his greatest legacy, the dismantling of a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America. 
In 1960 he became the president of the NAACP, and would become a key adviser to President Kennedy on civil rights. Dr. Weaver was appointed in 1961 to the Housing and Home Finance Agency, an organization that later became the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, when President Johnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, Dr. Weaver was, in Johnson's phrase, `the man for the job.' He thus became its first Secretary, and the first African-American to head a Cabinet agency. 
Following his government service, Weaver was, among various other academic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, and the president of Baruch College in Manhattan. Dr. Weaver earned undergraduate, master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard, wrote four books on urban affairs, and was one of the original directors of the Municipal Assistance Corp. designed to rescue financially strapped New York City in the 1970's. 
America, and Washington in particular, has lost one of its innovators, one of its creators and one of its true leaders--for Robert Weaver, like so few of leaders today, led not only with his words but more importantly with his deeds.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, has clearly set out the reasons why Fort Drum needs these two projects. They are essential to the training and readiness we and the Army have come to expect from the 10th Mountain Division. It seems whenever there has been a deployment in recent years, the 10th has been part of it. I simply add my support and my hope that the gunnery range and the training and education center will be included when the Senator from Montana and his conferees reach an agreement on military construction projects.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from New York as a cosponsor of this amendment out of deep concern about the effects of the VERA initiative. Not only were the two biggest cuts in the Nation taken from the two VA service networks in New York, but New York was selected to go first, to be the guinea pig for the new program. The results are alarming. Since the merger of the hospitals at Castle Point and Montrose in the Hudson Valley, 200 jobs have been eliminated and the mortality rate is up 80 percent. The acting director of the hospitals said this increase is not significant, that there are always ups and downs in the mortality rate. That may be, but when there is so dramatic an increase during so dramatic a staff cut, we have to stop what is going on and take a careful look. This is not an isolated example. I have similar reports from Canandaigua and other VA facilities around the State. 
One of the Veterans Health Administration's guiding principles with VERA is that `the decrease in overall costs shall not compromise the care given to its veteran population.' In New York we have empirical evidence that this principle has been trampled underfoot. I join my colleagues in asking that the General Accounting Office begin an investigation immediately into the quality of care being given to veterans under the constraints of the VERA formula, with particular attention being given to the two New York service networks. I hope the Senators from Missouri and Maryland will support this request.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I noted in Friday's New York Times the demise of Woolworth's, one of the Nation's best known retailers and one with its origins in upstate New York. The Times article quotes Hofstra professor Robert Sobel; `Woolworth was 100 years ago what Walmart is today.' Perhaps in a century Walmart will similarly be remembered as an icon of a by-gone era, but the mercantile comparison is apt. With over 8,000 stores worldwide, and with an emphasis on volume purchases and discount prices, Woolworth's was a retailing giant. 
The early efforts of Frank Winfield Woolworth did not portend such success. Born on a farm in Jefferson County in 1852, his favorite boyhood game was playing store but initially he was not very good at it. At 19 he began working in a village grocery store at no pay, and did so for 2 years. After a similar 3-month internship at Moore & Smith in Watertown, he finally secured gainful employment as a store clerk at $3.50 a week. 
Dollar stores might seem to be a late 20th century development, but in 1875 there was a profitable 99 cent store in Watertown. Mr. A. Bushnell hired Woolworth as a $10-dollar-a-week clerk in a 99 cent store he was opening in Port Huron, MI. Woolworth's lack of salesmanship led to a $1.50 cut in his salary. Still, he saw the possibilities of a store with all merchandise priced the same. In 1877 Woolworth returned to Moore & Smith. The next year he persuaded his employers to try a counter at a county fair on which all items sold for five cents. It was a great success. 
Woolworth persuaded Mr. Moore to back him with $300 for a five cent store on Bleeker Street in Utica, but it failed after 3 months. Woolworth realized that he had not had enough variety in his stock so in 1879 he opened a new store in Lancaster, PA with a line of ten-cent items as well. This one succeeded. Woolworth soon perfected the combination of inexpensive items you occasionally needed with inexpensive items you occasionally wanted. He opened his second store in Reading in 1884 and continued to expand. By 1909 Woolworth was in a position to commission the tallest building in the world, which the Woolworth Building was when it was completed in 1913. 
Woolworth's early partners had opened their own chains of five and tens. In 1912 they all were absorbed by the F.W. Woolworth Co., giving Woolworth control over 596 stores. He constantly strived to expand his line of five and ten cent merchandise, and was able to keep costs down by having goods manufactured especially for his chain, sometimes buying an entire year's output from a factory. 
Frank Woolworth died in 1919. His empire continued to grow. By 1954, 75 years after his first sale, Woolworth's had 2,850 stores and $700 million in annual sales. Six years later sales topped $1 billion. But changes on the American landscape and in the retail world were underway, and they would eventually lead to Friday's announcement. The emigration to the suburbs and competition from drug stores, specialty stores, malls, and large retailers along the highways finally wore down one of the pillars of Main Street. 
Woolworth's will be fondly remembered by millions of its customers who dined at the lunch counter and purchased some of life's little necessities there. The company also stands as a testament to the possibilities when one person has one good idea and endless determination.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note that the passage of the energy and water appropriations bill brings us one step closer to the completion of the West Valley demonstration project in western New York. In 1982 we authorized the West Valley demonstration project, in which we would learn to take liquid nuclear waste and mix it with glass. The process is called vitrification, and yields ten foot high glass logs that can be stored safely. After 14 years of preparation, research, and testing, vitrification began last July. On May 28 the 100th glass log was produced. 
The success of the vitrification process developed at West Valley and at Savannah River in Georgia led the Department of Energy to select it as the preferred method of disposal for such wastes. This is an accomplishment that the many hundreds of people in western New York who worked on the project can be most proud of. 
They have another 110 logs to go at West Valley, but the method works. Through fiscal year 1997 we have spent $1.2 billion on the project. The final amount in the bill for next year has not been determined, but it will it will bring the total over $1.3 billion. This has been money well spent, and will continue to be. We have learned to dispose of one type of hazardous waste, and can dispose of others with the vitrification process.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is now over half a century since the end of the Second World War. Millions of us who served in that war returned home to resume our lives and enjoy the blessings of peace. To all of us the end of the war was a relief. To the survivors of the Nazi concentration camps it was the difference between certain death and a chance to continue life after years of unspeakable deprivation and horror. 
Much has been written and said about the 6 million European Jews who were slaughtered during the Holocaust. A magnificent museum not far from this building pays moving and appropriate tribute to them, and to the millions of non-Jewish victims of Nazi Germany, as well. Much has been said about the dead. But far too little has been said about, or done for, the survivors. Almost half a million of them are still alive, including over 125,000 in this country and about the same number in Eastern and Central Europe and Israel. The youngest among them are now in their sixties; most of them are in their seventies and eighties and in increasingly frail health, complicated in many cases by the suffering they endured over half a century ago. 
The German Government has long recognized its moral obligation to assist the survivors of the Holocaust. The landmark reparations agreements of the early 1950's between the West German Government and Jewish groups were predicated on this simple premise. Yet, as years go by, it has become increasingly apparent that a large number of survivors, particularly those living in Eastern and Central Europe, were excluded from these agreements and are now being denied assistance on the flimsiest of technical grounds. In addition, tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors in North America and Israel have been similarly refused reparations for a variety of reasons that all pale when contrasted to Germany's half-century of generous pensions to German and non-German veterans of the notorious Waffen-SS. It is only fair and logical that the survivors of the Holocaust be treated in their old age with at least the same measure of support being afforded their torturers and prison guards. It is also only fair and logical that these aging survivors, as well as those who already receive reparations, be assisted in meeting their increasing medical expenses. 
It is for this purpose that I join Senators Graham, Hatch, and Dodd in submitting this resolution which speaks to the simple proposition that it is the sense of Congress that the German Government should expand and simplify its reparations system, provide reparations to Holocaust survivors in Eastern and Central Europe, and set up a fund to help cover the medical expenses of Holocaust survivors.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the headline on the front page of the Business Section in today's Washington Post reads `Government Said To Move Too Slowly on Year 2000 Computer Problem.' Mr. President, slowly at best. 
The Federal Government has been outright dilatory in addressing this problem. There are three stages in the process: assessment, renovation, and implementation--the third stage takes the longest. According to the OMB report released today, of the 4,500 mission critical computer systems in the Federal Government, 6 percent have been implemented, 17 percent have been renovated, and only 65 percent of the systems have even been assessed. A spokesman for the GIGA firm of Cambridge MA, that specializes in this issue, said: `They're not on a time schedule that looks like it's going to be doable.' I need not remind my colleagues that the clock is ticking. 
Be assured that in the year 2000, we will be blamed if we have not addressed the problem. And rightly so. Cosponsored by six other Senators, my bill, S. 22, will create a commission to see that the problem is fixed and increase the lagging private sector awareness of this crisis.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, might I just take a moment to observe that, with no uproar, we are about to do something rather important. In this vote on budget procedures we are going to legislate a change in the inflation index used to update official calculations of baseline spending. 
Under section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Gramm-Rudman-Hollings), required inflation adjustments are made using a `fixed-weight index' produced by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Section 1559(a)(3), of the changes in budget enforcement procedures now before us, require that in the future the adjustments should be based on the `domestic product chain-type price index'--also produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Given the improvements in index number theory, this is a perfectly appropriate change. 
Might I also just remind my colleagues that the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles two other indexes used by the Government--CPI-U which is used to adjust provisions of the Tax Code and CPI-W which is used to adjust benefits such as Social Security. 
For the record I note that none of these indexes give the same estimate of inflation. 
Here are the numbers for 1996: 
In percent   
 3.0 
CPI-W 
 2.9 
Fixed Weight Price Index 
 2.3 
Chain Weight Price Index 
 2.1 
Today's vote on budget procedures should be recalled when we return--as we must--to the issue of producing an accurate cost of living index for the purpose of automatic indexation of Government programs. No one is referring to today's legislative actions as `politicizing' the calculation of budget updates. We are just getting the numbers right. 
And no one should refer to legislating a correction in automatic indexation formulas as a `political' fix.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to state, on behalf of Senators Breaux, Graham, Kerrey, Chafee, and myself, that none of the tax relief measures and growth incentives contained in this tax bill will have a positive impact on the 3.8 million American citizens of Puerto Rico. This result is unfair and should be corrected. The Island's economy has paid dearly as a result of provisions in the tax bills of 1993 and 1996, as revenue offsets from Puerto Rico in those bills exceed $14 billion in the next few years. Yet those bills provided no benefits to our Puerto Rican citizens. 
Members from both sides of the aisle, Governors, national organizations, business associations, Hispanic-American groups and the entire Puerto Rican political community, have united forces in seeking a sensible Federal economic development tool in section 30A. This would provide viable pro growth tax incentives which will keep the Puerto Rican economy on a path of sustained growth. We should expand and extend this economic activity credit which is wage-based and promoted jobs and investment. We would urge my colleagues to correct this unfairness in Conference. If this is not possible, we will work to include this measure in legislation that comes before us at the next possible opportunity.

We shall have a balanced budget. We shall have a health care program for adults and children. And not least, we have had in fact 77 votes in favor of a successful and permanent Amtrak program in this country, a matter of particular concern to him, but both attributable to him. And I thank him.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise along with my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, to submit a resolution that urges the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention held in Seneca Falls, NY. In 1980 I introduced legislation to commemorate the idea of equal rights for women by creating the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls. That is where the Declaration of Sentiments was signed in 1848, stating that `all men and women are created equal' and that women should have equal political rights with men. From this beginning sprang the 19th amendment and many other advances for women this century and last. 
Western New York was home to an emerging reform movement during the 1830's and 1840's. Among reformers settling in Seneca Falls were Quaker women such as Lucretia Mott who took an active role in the effort to end slavery. For Mott, Martha Wright, Mary Ann M'Clintock, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, reform also included demanding rights for women. In July 1848, they planned the convention and hammered out a formal list of grievances based on the Declaration of Independence, denouncing inequities in property rights, education, employment, religion, marriage and family, and suffrage. On July 19, the Declaration of Sentiments was presented before an audience of 300. 
The Women's Rights Convention and the Declaration of Sentiments were a vital early step toward reversing these injustices against women. Many historians consider the convention to be one of the most important events in the history of the women's movement in the United States. 
The women of Seneca Falls challenged America to social revolution with a list of demands that touched upon every aspect of life. Testing different approaches, the early women's rights leaders came to view the ballot as the best way to challenge the system, but they did not limit their efforts to this one issue. Fifty years after the convention, women could claim property rights, employment and educational opportunities, divorce and child custody laws, and increased social freedoms. By the early 20th century, a coalition of suffragists, temperance groups, reform-minded politicians, and women's social welfare organizations mustered a successful push for the vote. 
Today Congress honors Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along with Susan B. Anthony, as revolutionary leaders of the women's movement by placing a statue of them in the Capitol Rotunda next to statues of other leaders in our Nation's history such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr. 
It is only fitting that a stamp be issued commemorating this historic anniversary highlighting the importance of continuing this struggle for equal rights and opportunity for women in areas such as health care, education, employment, and pay equity.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes to say to the Senator from Montana that his was an immensely honorable and accurate statement. You raised your hand, as did we all, for $24 billion of child health. I have been 21 years on the Finance Committee and there has never been such a moment or such a provision. And that happened in a compromise in which the Republican majority agreed to a large tax increase we could use for the child health care. 
Senator Roth was remarkable throughout, and no words of praise are too great. In our world, your word is all you have. We gave our word. I think we did it responsibly and I think we will be seen to have done such.

Mr. President, in brief, sir, in the history of child health care, in the U.S. Congress there has been no measure equivalent in size and range to the measure the distinguished chairman brings before you. We spent much of the 103d Congress on this subject and did not add a penny to child health care. In 2 days, the Finance Committee added $24 billion, which we bring to you in this amendment, which I am sure will be supported on both sides.

I would like to affirm everything he has said about the support on both sides of the aisle. It would be nice to have a unanimous vote. Let us hope we do have that, or near thereto.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, it is characteristic of our beloved former President pro tempore to thank others for the efforts that have led to the Court's nondecision today. Might I take the opportunity to thank him. It is his magisterial understanding of the Constitution and his Olympian commitment to it that brought us together, and brought to us the finest legal minds of this time to prepare the briefs that first won hands down in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and now have been put aside by the Court, but only temporarily. I think it would be not inappropriate to note that one judge and one Justice have spoken to this subject, and in both cases they have spoken to the unconstitutional nature of the act. 
I ask the Senate if I might just indulge to read a paragraph from Justice Stevens' dissenting opinion this morning. He says: 
The Line Item Veto Act purports to establish a procedure for the creation of laws that are truncated versions of bills that have been passed by the Congress and presented to the President for signature. If the procedure were valid, it would deny every Senator and every Representative any opportunity to vote for or against the truncated measure that survives the exercise of the President's cancellation authority. Because the opportunity to cast such votes is a right guaranteed by the text of the Constitution, I think it is clear that the persons who are deprived of that right by the Act have standing to challenge its constitutionality. Moreover, because the impairment of that constitutional right has an immediate impact on their official powers, in my judgment they need not wait until after cancellation authority to bring suit. Finally, the same reason that the respondents have standing provides a sufficient basis for concluding that the statute is unconstitutional. 
Madam President, I thank you for your indulgence. I think we may have overrun by a moment or two. I most appreciate that. 
Again, our appreciation to Senator Byrd. I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished fellow Senator from New York to introduce legislation that will redesignate sections of New York and Pennsylvania Route 17 as Interstate 86. The southern tier of New York has waited over 40 years for this historic legislation that will correct a mistake made in 1955 that has contributed to the economic decline of this once prosperous region. 
When the original plans were being developed for the New York Interstate System, Route 17 was to be designated the main east-west interstate route. The (Federal) Bureau of Public Roads thought otherwise. They preferred the New York State Thruway which was already under construction using state moneys. Albany did not object nor did representatives of the region. 
The error had no significance at the time, since no special funding was available for interstates. The very next year, however, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was enacted, creating a Highway Trust Fund to be funded through gasoline taxes. The Federal Government would now pay 90 percent of the cost of any interstate segment. The Southern Tier Expressway--Route 17--was not eligible for those interstate funds. 
In the 1950's the region was still bustling--IBM was in Binghamton, half the television sets in the world were built in Elmira, Corning was a high tech contender, and Jamestown was a major manufacturing center. What begun as an Indian trail, became a great railroad, and a strikingly creative industrial corridor, was allowed to languish. 
It is time we do something about it. 
This legislation we introduce today would finally ameliorate the legacy of an opportunity missed long ago. 
The bill would immediately designate 360 miles of Route 17 between Erie, PA and Harriman, NY, that meet Federal interstate construction standards as Interstate 86, creating connections to I-90, I-390, I-81, I-84, and I-87. The remaining 30 miles of Route 17 would be designated as a future part of the interstate system and will become I-86 as soon as the State Department of Transportation upgrades them. I am confident the NYDOT, working together with the Federal Highway Administration, will soon have the rest of Route 17 up to interstate standards. 
The southern tier region, along with the rest of Upstate New York, has suffered enduring economic hardship and job losses, even as the national economy has boomed. The bill I propose to redesignate Route 17 as I-86 would help enhance the visibility of this important region and highlight its potential for business development and tourism. 
I would also like to recognize the efforts of Samara Barend, a southern tier native, who was so effective in mobilizing support for this issue. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of this most important legislation.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we begin the debate on the second of two budget reconciliation bills called for under the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1998, I again want to commend and thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for the fine bipartisan manner in which he has led us this year. I look forward to that spirit of bipartisanship continuing today as we work toward the adoption of the tax bill by the full Senate. 
It is my belief, although it is not much shared just now in Congress or in the White House, that this is no time for tax cuts. Just yesterday, in a report released by Treasury Secretary Rubin, the International Monetary Fund, in its annual review of the U.S. economy, stated that the United States should delay tax cuts `in order to achieve an earlier reduction in the budget deficit' and strengthen the credibility of the balanced-budget pact between Congress and President Clinton. 
Were it up to this Senator, we would continue on the deficit reduction course begun in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which has had extraordinary results. The economy is in its best shape in 30 years. CBO projects that the deficit will be $67 billion for fiscal year 1997, far below original estimates. Inflation was just two-tenths of 1 percent in May--equivalent to an annual inflation rate of only 2 percent. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8 percent, its lowest in more than a quarter century, and the Wall Street Journal reported today that the measurement of consumer confidence in the economy is at a 28-year high. 
Given this success, we may well come to regret having enacted the tax cuts in this bill. Nevertheless, we do not have a majority in the 105th Congress. The congressional leadership and the President have agreed that there will be tax cuts this year. And so given that reality, I joined with other Democratic members of the Finance Committee in working with Chairman Roth--in a bipartisan mode--to help shape the bill now before us. The resulting legislation is not altogether what some of us would prefer, but even so it does include a number of redeeming provisions. 
I would particularly wish to commend and thank the chairman for the inclusion of the following provisions: Making permanent the single most successful tax incentive for education, the exclusion from income of employer-provided educational assistance under section 127. The Roth-Moynihan bill to make 127 permanent now has over 50 cosponsors, including all 20 members of the Finance Committee; repealing the cap on issuance of section 501(c)(3) bonds for universities, colleges, and nonhospital health facilities; providing $2.3 billion in funding for Amtrak by allocating one-half cent per gallon of the Federal gasoline excise tax; and extending the fair-market value deductibility of gifts of appreciated property to private foundations.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering two important changes approved by the Finance Committee for the Medicare Program: increasing the eligibility age from 65 to 67, and increasing premiums for higher income beneficiaries. Raising the eligibility age will simply bring Medicare into line with the retirement age under Social Security. And means-testing the part B premium is in fact overdue. 
I was a member of the administration of President Johnson when Medicare legislation was developed and enacted, and I remind Senators that at that time the part B provision for physician's bills was meant to be paid one-half by the individual and one-half out of general revenues--50-50. 
In 1972, we limited the increase in the part B premium to the rate of increase in Social Security benefits, which are tied to the Consumer Price Index. Inasmuch as medical costs grew at a much faster rate than that, generally, of prices, that 50-50 share gradually dropped to what is now a quarter, 25 percent. In no way do we change that 25-75 arrangement that has emerged, but we do ask that high-income retired persons pay a higher premium. About 6 percent to 7 percent of retirees will be affected. 
Retired couples with incomes under $75,000, will not in any way be affected; individuals with incomes under $50,000 will not in any way be affected. We are really only returning somewhat to the original intention and the original provisions of Medicare part B. 
If my distinguished chairman would permit me, I yield the balance of my 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some may have thought that there has been a leakage of reality about the social insurance programs of the American Nation; that only crisis brings us forward to some sensible responses. But I think today we proved just the opposite. The vote earlier on extending the eligibility age for Medicare over the next generation to 67 years parallels exactly the measure we took at a time of crisis in 1983 with respect to Social Security. This was recommended by a commission of which I was a member. Senator Dole, our beloved former majority leader, was a member. 
Sir, I don't know about other Members of this body but I have not heard a word about that. It has been accepted. It is something that is going to take place over a generation. It makes sense. 
The same on this matter of contributions of high-income persons--what is basically an intergenerational subsidy on retirement benefits and health-care benefits. 
In 1983, we began to tax Social Security benefits for high-income persons up to 50 percent of their benefit. In 1993, in legislation I brought to the floor from the Finance Committee, we took it to 85 percent. That is the actuarial income that is not paid by the contributor himself or herself. 
Sir, there has been no response or reaction to that, save acceptance that it is fair, and it makes sense. This is fair, and it is necessary. 
I would say once again I was a member of the administration of President Johnson when the planning for Medicare and Medicaid took place. On part B we specified that half the premium would be paid by the person choosing to take the option of buying this form of health insurance. In 1972, we limited increases in the premium to the rate of increase in Social Security benefits, which are tied to the Consumer Price Index. But because of the higher rise in medical costs in the years that followed, above the rate of price increase, we dropped it to 25 percent. It is 25 percent today--not what we planned when we began this program, when the costs were much lower and unsustainable in the years ahead. The annual part B subsidy right now per person is $1,600 of general revenue--not trust fund. And if we have to provide that a $500,000 earner pays 2.9 percent, why can we not do so? I think, Mr. President, we are going to. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, tragedy has beset the family of Malcolm X and Betty Shabazz with such abundance that I doubt few of us can comprehend their grief. 
Yesterday, Betty Shabazz the proud educator and activist wife of the late Malcolm X, died of complications that ensued after she suffered burns over 80 percent of her body in a fire at her Yonkers apartment on the first day of this month. Dr. Shabazz had battled her way through five extensive operations since the fire, but the injuries proved too extensive for her to overcome this final tribulation. Having witnessed the assassination of her husband, defended one of her children against charges of an alleged murder plot, and sought to ease the troubles of her grandchildren, Dr. Shabazz rose above it all to defy critics and symbolize an ability to overcome all means of adversity. 
In trying to reconcile this tragedy, I recall the words of Oscar Wilde who wrote: `It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.' My deepest sympathy goes out to this family that has too often been forced to grapple with the `absolute incoherence of tragedy.'

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like first to thank our revered chairman for his concise and comprehensive account of this epic legislation. It comes to the floor from a unanimous Finance Committee. 
These are the first substantive changes made in Medicare and Medicaid since these measures were enacted a generation ago. I was present in 1965. I am here in 1997. I so state, our problem --and it is a curious problem in social policy, is that I am not sure we will be heard because we are not making enough noise. And we are not making enough noise, Mr. President, for the simple reason that we are in agreement. We have changed our minds about certain basic things. We have recognized the events of the past generation that require us to do so. 
We came into these programs little expecting how much they would come to take over in the Federal fisc at a time when medicine was just on the verge of a great shift in its capacity, its ability to cure, to treat, to heal. Fee for service was the only form of medicine available to most persons, not otherwise known, and Medicaid was thought to be a very minor aside. 
We reached a point where health care, partly because we have so much better health care, became hugely expensive. The chairman noted that in 1992, Medicaid grew by 29 percent. 
Mr. President, that means it doubles every 3 years, or more accurately, doubles every 30 months. You cannot sustain that. We are therefore profoundly reforming the system, not so much returning it to an earlier good state, as bringing it forward to deal with the present realities and possibilities offered by managed care and the general change in medicine of recent years. 
I say again, before there was agreement in these matters, we could have had a markup in our committee that went on for 3 months, we could have had rallies, speeches, petitions, filibusters, heavens knows what, because there was not in fact agreement. When agreement is arrived at, when there is consensus, the most extraordinary changes can take place in a seemingly everyday manner, without a voice raised or a single dissent. This is also particularly owed to the work of the Senator from Texas, who chairs the Subcommittee on Health, as the chairman observed, and whom I am happy to note is here on the floor. He found that agreement and he put it in place. 
There are other things in the legislation. I do want to note that we have added $8 billion for child health care in the form of insurance, for a total in the two reconciliation bills of $24 billion. I can recall the days when Wilbur Cohen assured us the whole program would cost $24 billion a year, and indeed for a while there it did. I think it should be clear that this was the work of Senator Hatch, who cares so very much about this matter. Equally, Senator Rockefeller was able to bring about an increase in the moneys that will be available to low-income families as part of the child tax credit in combination with the earned-income tax credit. 
Senator Bob Kerrey, who does not intend that things should always be done the way they always have been done--save perhaps in the U.S. Navy--proposed, and we agreed, that the time had come to begin to ask higher income persons to pay a higher premium to get this insurance, which they do not have to take. It is optional, but which if they can afford to pay something more like the original anticipated contribution, well then, they ought to. That is just good sense. I think this will be understood by the Senate and in time by our colleagues in the House. We also move the Medicare eligibility age from age 65 to 67, bringing it into conformity with Social Security. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think it has to be said--and I know the chairman will agree with me--that we did miss an opportunity of lasting consequence for Federal finance this year by failing to take action on how we measure the cost of living. 
Our chairman has been an outspoken advocate of developing an accurate cost-of-living index, which we do not now have. We have cost-of-living indexes all over the place. You find them in the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, and the Health Care Financing Administration. 
But we had agreement, from an initiative taken in the Finance Committee, to produce an adjustment to the Consumer Price Index--which is not cost of living--by 1.1 percentage points. It would 
have produced $1 trillion in 12 years, and it would have put the Social Security trust funds in actuarial balance until the year 2052. This was in our hands, and it was let slip at the last moment. We blinked, and the opportunity is now history. 
But part of that history is also that the chairman of the Finance Committee and the members of the Finance Committee--I do not speak for all of them; I certainly speak for myself--realized this should be done. It is a correction that should be made. The sooner we do, the more we will be able to address other problems that remain because, as the chairman said, we have a series of measures here that ensure the viability of Medicare for 10 years. But we mean to be around more than 10 years, and we will have to address this subject also. 
Finally, there are exceptional measures in this bill to make provision for teaching hospitals and medical schools. One of the unanticipated consequences, to use the chairman's phrase, the phrase of Robert K. Merton in 1935, I think, that the economic rationalization of health care has been that the teaching hospitals and medical schools, which necessarily must charge more for the care they provide because they are teaching and training and do research, find themselves in an exposed situation which we can take care of from the gains we acquire in the course of rationalization. But if we do not, we shall find that one of the unanticipated consequences is that we spoiled our medical schools at this moment in the great age of medical science. This bill precisely addresses the matter in ways I think are constructive. And we will look into the issue further in the commission which the chairman proposes. 
It remains for me, sir, simply once again to congratulate our revered chairman. If you would so measure the quality of his achievement, observe the silent awe which is now observed in the Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Patrick Bistrian, Jr., of Amagansett, NY, on the occasion of his retirement from the board of education of the Amagansett Union Free School District after 30 years of service. 
As a student, Pat Bistrian earned recognition in both academic and athletic pursuits. He held almost all the high school track and field records. Local legend has it that some of them still stand today. His leadership in school evolved into a devotion to community service. 
Throughout his 30 years on the board, he never wavered in his commitment to the children of the Amagansett School District. Guided by common sense and an admirable dose of doggedness, his can do attitude was always applied for the good of the children. After a fire destroyed the school gymnasium in 1975, Patrick Bistrian fastidiously saw to every detail regarding the replacement of the building. To his credit, the facility exceeded even the grandest expectations and came in under budget. 
While voluntarism has now become fashionable throughout the land, the concept is not new to Patrick Bistrian; for him, it is a way of life. I am certain the Members of the Senate join me in saluting Patrick Bistrian for his 30 years of selfless commitment to the Amagansett community. Much like his athletic accomplishments in track and field, he has left behind a legacy that will surely go unrivaled for some time to come.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this Friday, June 20, marks the last day Steven J. Shimberg will work here in the Senate as staff director and chief counsel of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Next month, he will begin a new career with the National Wildlife Federation. 
Steve Shimberg is a New York native and a magna cum laude graduate of the State University of New York at Buffalo. Upon graduating from Duke University School of Law, Steve spent 3 years as a trial attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice's Land and Natural Resources Division before joining the staff of the Committee on Environment and Public Works in 1981. 
I have been a member of the Committee since I entered the Senate in 1977. I served as the chairman or ranking minority member of the Water Resources Subcommittee from the 96th Congress through the 103d Congress, and I served as full committee chairman from September 1992 through January 1993. So, over the years, I have seen Steve shepherd through the committee enormously complicated and thoroughly bipartisan legislation to protect our natural resources. I can attest to Steve's personableness, his sense of humor and good cheer, his comity, and his utter competence. Consummately professional, always courteous, and always calm. 
Environmental policy, to be supportable, must be based on sound science. And so I have argued that the committee needs more scientists and fewer lawyers on the staff. Steve certainly is an exception; he has been indispensable. While I applaud Federation officials for their astuteness in hiring Steve, I lament the loss his departure means to the committee, and to the Senate. We will miss him. 
Sir Christopher Wren's tombstone reads, `Lector, si monumentum requiris circumspice.' With regard to Steve's work over the past 17 years on the committee, the products are around us all: cleaner air, cleaner water, a greatly redeemed physical and human environment.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the great Nobel physicist, Hans A. Bethe, is the subject of the lead article in the `Science Times' section of the New York Times. One cannot help but marvel at the life Dr. Bethe, a national treasure, has led. In 1935, he fled Nazi Germany, settling at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Within three years, he developed an equation to explain solar fusion which won him a Nobel prize in 1967. 
Hans Bethe led the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos; he was, one could say, present at the creation. He stood next to J. Robert Oppenheimer on July 16, 1945 in the New Mexico desert, a witness to the testing of the first atomic bomb. The scientists at the site knew that if the test worked it would end World War II, as it did within a month, and forever change the nature of warfare. 
At the moment of that explosion, a new era began. It changed us. Changed the world, and changed all those present. Maurice M. Shapiro, now chief scientist emeritus of the Laboratory for Cosmic Physics at the Naval Research Station, in Washington, recalled the scene in the New Mexico desert in an interview two years ago:  
At precisely 5:30 there was a blinding flash--brighter than many suns--and then a flaming fireball. Within seconds a churning multicolored column of gas and dust was rising. Then, within it, a narrower column of debris swirled upward, spreading out into an awesome mushroom-shaped apparition high in the atmosphere--Maurice M. Shapiro, `Echoes of the Big Bang,' New York Times, July 15, 1995. 
Next came `an oppressive sense of foreboding.'

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator D'Amato, along with Senators Chafee, Breaux, Hatch and Graham, in introducing bipartisan legislation to improve the existing tax credit for providing employment in Puerto Rico. 
Economic conditions in Puerto Rico are cause for serious concern. Over half of the population lives below the poverty line. Puerto Rico's average annual per capita income of approximately $7,500 is less than one-third the national average. Its average unemployment rate is well over twice the national average of 4.8 percent for May 1997. 
In recent years, Congress has twice imposed significant tax increases on companies doing business in Puerto Rico, first in 1993 and again in 1996. While it is unclear to what extent those tax changes will result in employer relocation or lost jobs, they undoubtedly have increased the vulnerability of the economy of Puerto Rico. Exacerbating this economic uncertainty, the tax changes are being phased in at the same time that Puerto Rico faces increased economic competition from low-wage Caribbean countries and from Mexico. 
This legislation would respond to these serious problems by building on the temporary wage credit that is currently provided in the Internal Revenue Code. Employers generally would be eligible for a tax credit equal to 60 percent of wages and fringe benefit expenses for employees located in Puerto Rico. New as well as existing employers would be rewarded for providing local jobs. The credit would remain in effect until the attainment of specific economic goals in Puerto Rico, which would trigger an automatic phaseout of the credit. 
I believe this investment in the long-term economic health and well-being of Puerto Rico is imperative. It is our obligation to the people of Puerto Rico, who are U.S. citizens but not represented in the Senate, to take note and address the very serious plight of their economy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of the nomination of James Harmon as President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. 
Mr. Harmon is a life-long resident of New York State. After he was born in New York City, his family moved to Mamaroneck where he was raised. After graduating from Brown University and then receiving his M.B.A. in finance from the Wharton Graduate School at the University of Pennsylvania, he returned to New York to launch his professional career. 
Currently, Mr. Harmon serves as senior chairman of Schroder Wertheim & Co., Inc., an international investment bank headquartered in New York City. Prior to his assumption of the senior chairmanship in 1996, Mr. Harmon was the chairman and chief executive officer of Schroder Wertheim where he oversaw the expansion of the firm's domestic and international investment banking activities. The merger of Schroder ple [UK] and Wertheim in 1985, initiated by Mr. Harmon, created a global investment bank with approximately 5,000 employees operating in 33 countries around the world. In addition, to his work at Schroder Wertheim, the finance background which Mr. Harmon would bring to the Export-Import Bank was honed during his tenure as a member of the Advisory Committee on International Capital Markets and former chairman of the nominating committee of the Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. 
Mr. Harmon's influence in New York City extends beyond banking. In 1994, along with former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, he founded the Barnard-Columbia University Center for Public Policy where he still serves as chairman of its advisory board. Mr. Harmon is also a member of the executive committee and board of directors of the New York City Partnership, the principal vehicle for private-sector activities which improve the city's economic and social health. 
I congratulate the distinguished nominee and wish him great good wishes and congratulations. I thank the President for bringing Mr. Harmon's nomination forward.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as our Nation prepares to celebrate Flag Day on the 14th of this month, I rise to pay tribute to over 1 million men who belong to the largest and oldest fraternal organization in the world, America's Freemasonry. Since the Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as our Nation's flag on June 14, 1777, Masons have given this beloved symbol their staunch support. 
It is nearly 48 years since President Harry S. Truman signed an act of Congress recognizing Flag Day as a national holiday. Truman's contribution as a Mason follows the efforts of other great Masonic national leaders. Adm. John Paul Jones flew Old Glory at Quiberon Bay, France on February 13, 1778, in the first recognition of the United States by a foreign nation. Nearly 200 years later, Astronaut Edwin `Buzz' Aldrin traveled with an American flag to the Moon. With their distinguished moral code and immutable patriotism, these and other Masons, including Francis Scott Key, helped to advance the flag as a true symbol of our Nation. 
Senator Robert C. Winthrop (1809-1894) of Massachusetts once said, `Our flag is our national ensign, pure and simple, behold it! Listen to it! Every star has a tongue, every stripe is articulate.' Indeed, with the constant help of America's Freemasonry, the U.S. flag has been seen in every corner of the world and has been recognized as an emblem of our continued democracy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate joins the people of Israel as they celebrate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. The Six-Day War began after Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, spurred on by the Soviet Union, conspired with Syria, Jordan, and Iraq to have the people of Israel `thrown into the sea.' Nasser persuaded U.N. Secretary General U Thant to withdraw peacekeeping forces from the Gaza strip which for 10 years had acted as a buffer between Israel and Egypt. The Egyptians began amassing troops in the Sinai. Israel, surrounded by 250,000 Arab troops preparing for war, launched a devastating pre-preemptive strike on June 5. 
The war was a significant event in Israeli history and resulted in the reunification of Jerusalem, which before the war had been divided with all access to the Old City and its holy sites denied to Jews. 
I have been involved with this particular issue in some measure since my tenure as the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations in 1975. By the early 1970's, a Soviet-led coalition wielded enormous power in the U.N. General Assembly and used it in an assault against the democracies of the world. In that regard, I cite an editorial in the New Republic which has said of the United Nations in that time that `During the Cold War, the United Nations became a chamber of hypocrisy and proxy aggression.' 
Those who had failed to destroy Israel on the field of battle joined those who wished to discredit all Western democratic governments in an unprecedented, sustained attack on the very right of a U.N. member state to exist within the family of nations. 
The efforts in the 1970's to delegitimize Israel came in many forms. None more insidious than the twin campaigns to declare Zionism to be a form of racism and to deny Israel's ties to Jerusalem. Those who ranted against the `racist Tel Aviv regime' were spewing two ugly lies. Both had at their heart a denial of Israel's right to exist. 
The first lie, the infamous Resolution 3379, was finally repealed on December 16, 1991, after the cold war had ended and as the Soviet Union was dissolving. The second we are still dealing with today. 
That Jerusalem is, and should remain Israel's undivided capital would seem an unremarkable statement, but for the insidious campaign--begun in the 1970's--to delegitimize Israel by denying her ties to Jerusalem. For far too long the United States acquiesced in this shameful lie by refusing to locate our embassy in Israel's capital city. As long as Israel's most important friend in the world refused to acknowledge that Israel's capital city is its own, we lent credibility and dangerous strength to the lie that Israel is somehow a misbegotten, illegitimate or transient state. 
This suggestion is all the more untenable when you consider that no other people on this planet have been identified as closely with any city as the people of Israel are with Jerusalem --a city which recently celebrated the 3000th anniversary of King David declaring it his capital. No Jewish religious ceremony is complete without mention of the Holy City. And twice a year, at the conclusion of the Passover Seder and the Day of Atonement services, all assembled repeat one of mankind's shortest and oldest prayers, `Next Year in Jerusalem.' 
Throughout the centuries Jews kept this pledge, often sacrificing their very lives to travel to, and live in, their holiest city. It should be noted that the first authoritative Turkish census of 1844 reported that Jews were by far the largest ethnic group in Jerusalem--long before there was a West Jerusalem, or even any settlements outside the ancient walled city. 
When the modern State of Israel declared independence on May 14, 1948, Jerusalem was the only logical choice for the new nation's capital, even if it was only a portion of Jerusalem--the Jordanian Arab Legion having occupied the eastern half of the city and expelled the Jewish population of the Old City. Jerusalem was sundered by barbed-wire and cinderblock and Israelis of all faiths and Jews of all citizenship were barred from even visiting the section under Jordanian occupation. 
The world was silent while the historic Jewish Quarter of the city was sacked and razed to the ground, synagogues and schools were destroyed, and 3,000 years of history were denied. This bizarre anomaly only ended on June 5, 1967, when Israel faced renewed aggression from Egypt and Syria, both then close friends of, and dependents of the Soviet Union. As hostilities commenced, Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol sent a message to King Hussein of Jordan promising that, if Jordan refrained from entering the war, Israel would not take action against it. Jordan, however, attacked Israel that same day. Within the week, Israeli forces had captured all of Jerusalem, as well as other territories west of the Jordan River. The City of David was once again united, and has remained so since 1967. Under Israeli rule Jerusalem has flourished as it did not under Jordanian occupation, and the religious shrines of all faiths have been 
meticulously protected. 
Having made the odious link between Zionism and racism, the Soviet inspired coalition now set its sights on the heart of Israel: Jerusalem. The Seventh Conference of Heads of State of Government of Non-Aligned Countries, which convened in New Delhi, India, March 7 through 11, 1983, devoted several lengthy passages of its Final Declaration to excoriating Israel and its ally, the United States. Special attention was devoted to the question of Jerusalem's status. And not just East Jerusalem as had become the practice of such fora. 
I happened to be in New Delhi in the days before the summit began and was shown a draft of the Final Declaration. The draft passage of Israel read: `Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel should withdraw completely and unconditionally from it and restore it to Arab sovereignty.' 
While surely this can be read as a provocative statement that all of Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory, when pressed on the point, my Indian hosts assured me that by Jerusalem they really only meant east Jerusalem, which is to say the Old City, or perhaps the Arab section. Hence, the significance of the revised final text of the declaration of some 101 nations. 
This is what the nonaligned declared in that session in 1983: 
West Jerusalem is part of the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel should withdraw completely and unconditionally from it and restore it to Arab sovereignty. West Jerusalem! 
The 101 nations of the Non-Aligned Movement declared that the Israeli Parliament and government buildings, Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial, the King David Hotel, the whole of the new city, did not belong to Israel. The State of Israel is not a nation. It has no capital, or so said the nonaligned. 
What was the response from Washington to such polemics? Not a word. In effect, our silence could have been interpreted as implying that we had no quarrel with those who state that Israel has no capital. And thus, that Israel is less than a sovereign nation. 
It was at this point that I brought the issue to the Senate floor. On October 31, 1983, I introduced S. 2031 which required the relocation of our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. 
Official documents published by the United States Government at the time, such as the State Department's `Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts: Guide for Business Representatives,' listed Jerusalem separate from Israel. The guide listed countries alphabetically, under each of which in subscript was enumerated the various diplomatic posts the United States Government maintained in that country. 
There was Ireland, with the one post in Dublin; then came Israel, with one diplomatic office listed, its address in Tel Aviv; then curiously several pages later, after Japan, there was listed a Consulate General in a country called Jerusalem. Then came Jordan and Kenya. 
That was how the `Key Officers of Foreign Service Posts' was organized until the end of 1994, when Secretary Christopher published the document with Jerusalem listed under the Israel heading. This is a welcome change. That simple refusal by the United States Government to associate our consulate in Jerusalem with the State of Israel carried much greater weight with the Non-Aligned countries than we realized. 
They would not have acted as they had done in 1983 if they did not think at some measure we were not in disagreement. Our documents have so implied. 
While my legislation did not pass in 1983, the drive to clarify the status of Jerusalem began to gain momentum in the Senate in 1990 when I submitted Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, which states simply: `Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of the State of Israel.' A simple declarative sentence which gained 85 cosponsors and was adopted unanimously by the Senate and by an overwhelming majority in the House. 
On November 8, 1995, the Dole-Moynihan Jerusalem Embassy Act became the law of the United States. The law states, as a matter of United States Government policy, that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel, and should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they are today. 
In the winter of 1981, I wrote an article in Commentary entitled `Joining The Jackals' in response to the Carter administration's disastrous support for a resolution challenging Israel's rights in Jerusalem. Sixteen years later, we find that the jackals are in retreat. Israelis and Palestinians are negotiating the details of their future. And the United States can make a simple but important contribution to this process by unequivocally recognizing Israel's chosen capital. 
The Senate has affirmed this simple proposition by unanimously adopting Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, on May 20, 1997, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and states that:  
[The Senate] strongly believes that 
Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they have been by Israel during the past 30 years; 
[and] 
Calls upon the President and Secretary of State to publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain and undivided capital of the state of Israel. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their strong support of this measure, and again wish to congratulate our friends in Israel on this important occasion.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to authorize the placement of a statue of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi --Mahatma Gandhi--on Federal land across the street from the Indian embassy in Washington DC. The Government of India has offered a statue of Gandhi as a gift to the United States. In order to place it on Federal land, an act of Congress is required. This bill will fulfill just that purpose, and I thank the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] and the Senator from Maryland, [Mr. Sarbanes] for joining me in this endeavor. 
India is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of its independence. Authorizing the placement of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi, often called the father of the Indian nation, would serve as a fitting tribute to Indian democracy which has survived--in fact, thrived--despite enormous challenges, and a symbol of the growing strength of the bonds between our two countries. 
It is particularly appropriate that a statue of Mahatma Gandhi be selected for this purpose. The effects of his non-violent actions and the philosophy which guided them were not limited to his country, nor his time. His influence in the United States was most notably felt in the civil rights movement, but has also infused all levels of our society. 
If I may invade ever so slightly the privacy of the President's luncheon table, in May 1994, Mr. Clinton had as his guest the distinguished Prime Minister of India, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, who in his youth was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi. In a graceful passage, Prime Minister Rao related how it came to pass that Mahatma Gandhi, caught up in the struggle for fair treatment to the Indian community in South Africa, and in consequence in jail, read Thoreau's essay on `Civil Disobedience' which confirmed his view that an honest man is duty-bound to violate unjust laws. He took this view home with him, and in the end the British raj gave way to an independent Republic of India. Then Martin Luther King, Jr., repatriated the idea and so began the great civil rights movement of this century. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., has written of the singular influence Gandhi's message of nonviolent resistance had on him when he first learned of it while studying at Crozier Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. He would later describe that influence in his first book, `Stride Toward Freedom':  
As I read I became deeply fascinated by [Gandhi's] philosophy of non-violent resistance . . . as I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see its potency in the area of social reform . . . prior to reading Gandhi, I had concluded that the love ethics of Jesus were only effective in individual relationships . . . but after reading Gandhi, I saw how utterly mistaken I was. 
. . . It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and non-violence that I discovered the method for social reform that I had been seeking for so many months . . . I came to feel that this was the only morally and practically sound method open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom . . . this principle became the guiding light of our movement. Christ furnished the spirit and motivation and Gandhi furnished the method. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., believed that Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent resistance was the guiding light of the American civil rights movement. As Dr. King wrote, `Gandhi furnished the message.' A statue of Gandhi, given as a gift from the Government of India, on a small plot of Federal land along Massachusetts Avenue, in front of the Indian Embassy, will stand not only as a tribute to the shared values of the two largest democracies in the world but will also pay tribute to the lasting influence of Gandhian thought on the United States. An influence that is so pervasive that when the President and the Prime Minister of India meet at the White House for lunch, a half-century after Gandhi's death, it is no surprise that he should be a topic of conversation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the New York City borough once derided as `the worst slum in America' has been named an All-American City by the National Civic League. This achievement, announced last weekend by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, is the result of a decade of hard work and careful planning. Improved economic conditions have spawned a renewal of spirit; a cultural and economic renaissance that gives hope for the future. 
In his 1997 State of the Borough Report, President Ferrer writes, `Ten years ago, the Bronx was best known as the borough of window decals and trash-strewn vacant lots. Abandoned buildings. Illegal Medicaid mills. With its broken windows and broken dreams, the Borough of the Bronx stood as the international symbol of urban failure.' 
What a difference a decade can make. The National Civic League Award confirms what the residents of the Bronx already knew; their community has undergone an unprecedented transformation. This metamorphosis is evidenced by strong economic growth, 522 new businesses, the preservation of the Old Bronx Borough Courthouse, improvements in transportation, 30,000 new housing units, new parks and recreational facilities, and a celebration of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the people of the Bronx.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to note that May 28 was a significant day in West Valley, NY, and in the field of nuclear waste disposal. In 1982 we authorized the West Valley demonstration project, in which we would learn to take liquid nuclear waste and mix it with glass. The process is called vitrification, and yields ten foot high glass logs that can be stored safely. After 14 years of preparation, research, and testing, vitrification began last July. On May 28th the 100th glass log was produced. 
The success of the vitrification process developed at West Valley and at the Savannah River in Georgia led the Department of Energy to select it as the preferred method of disposal for such wastes. This is an accomplishment that the many hundreds of people in western New York who worked on the project can be most proud of. 
They have another 110 logs to go at West Valley, but it is clear that the technology works. It can and will be replicated at other sites around the country, helping to solve one of our most vexing and serious waste disposal problems. Moreover, vitrification can be used to store other types of hazardous waste without fear of leaking. I congratulate all those at Westinghouse and the many agencies involved with the West Valley project for achieving this milestone.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Watertown Daily Times' Washington Bureau Chief Alan Emory marked a most felicitous occasion on Saturday. Alan has served the Watertown Daily Times and the people of New York State for a half a century. My colleague Senator D'Amato and I call him `the Dean' of the New York correspondents in our Nation's capital and, indeed, he is one of the Nation's most sagacious and indefatigable journalists. 
His capacity for balanced reporting was grounded in his upbringing. His father was a Democratic New York State Supreme Court judge, his mother a labor arbitrator for the Republican mayor of New York, Fiorello LaGuardia. After Emory's childhood in New York City and Long Island and a fine education at Exeter, Harvard, and the Columbia School of Journalism, the young man headed north to seek his fortune. He landed a job at the Watertown Times in 1947 as its correspondent in Massena, a small city along the St. Lawrence Seaway. He steadily rose up the ranks to State editor, legislative correspondent, and editorial writer. 
In 1951, the newspaper opened a Washington bureau. He eagerly accepted the Johnson family's offer to become the bureau chief and has served the people of New York State in Washington ever since--46 years, a term almost twice as long as that of our State's longest serving Senator, Jacob Javits, who served for 24 years. 
Mr. Emory is one of the most prolific daily journalists in Washington. He writes up to six stories per day and two columns per week for the Sunday Commentary section. He also is the Washington columnist for the monthly magazine, The Empire State Report. He does all this with a standard of accuracy and insight that few can match. While the Washington Post in 1977 described Mr. Emory as being one of a vanishing breed of Washington correspondents for regional newspapers, he remains an example of journalistic excellence to young reporters. 
Mr. Emory has written more than just news stories. He also is one of the most gelastic lyricists ever to grace the Gridiron Club's talent pool. He has written music for Washington's most prestigious journalists' club ever since he joined it 21 years ago, and he produced many of its most amusing skits. He has also served the Gridiron Club in more serious ways--as its vice president for 1994, president for 1995, and current treasurer. 
Legislators and journalists are supposed to keep a healthy distance between them but I confess to a great personal affection for my old friend, Alan Emory. I congratulate him and his beloved wife, Nancy, as he celebrates 50 fine years with the Watertown Daily Times.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. I wish to pay tribute to Roger G. Kennedy upon his retirement as director of the National Park Service and for a distinguished public service career as director of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, vice president of the Ford Foundation, and special assistant, variously, to the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Secretary of Labor. Mr. Kennedy will be honored at a grand celebration in New York's historic Battery Park tonight and I deeply regret that the press of Senate business prevents me from attending. 
Roger Kennedy is a man of enlightenment tastes. He has been a lawyer, a scholar, a writer, a public servant of the first rank, but his avocation has always been architectural history. In Orders From France, his masterpiece on architecture, Kennedy wrote brilliantly about the career of Joseph Jacques Ramee, the French architect who was trained at the court of Louis XVI and designed buildings all over Europe, but helped pave the way for American neoclassicism. 
In 1815, Ramee designed the magnificent campus of Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., one of the Nation's first liberal-arts colleges west of the Hudson River. Ramee's campus plan embodied a vision of education that entwined rationalism with the laws of nature--an ordered court opening to a romantically landscaped garden and the endless view to the west. Kennedy wrote that Ramee `placed his buildings in the context of nature, but nature tamed, organized, made orderly, like the energies of students.' A decade later the Union College campus, the first in the Nation to have a rotunda at its center, become the model for Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Latrobe to design the glorious University of Virginia in Charlottesville. 
Given Roger Kennedy's interest in Ramee, a man with both an architectural and educational vision, it is most fitting that we should honor him at Battery Park, the site of the Castle Clinton National Monument, one of the National Park Service's most important historical, cultural, and educational sites. The park is visited by over 3 million people a year who come to marvel at its spectacular views of New York's harbor, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island, and drink of its rich history. 
For Battery Park's history fascinates. Fort Amsterdam was built by the Dutch on the site in 1626 and surrendered to the British in 1664, and subsequently renamed Fort George. In 1783, the British colors at Fort George were hauled down, marking the beginning of American rule. Fort George was subsequently demolished, its rubble added to the Manhattan shoreline. By 1811, a sturdy red sandstone fort--later named Castle Clinton--was erected. 
Castle Clinton served as everything but a military facility. It was first an entertainment center for concerts and theater. P.T. Barnum staged the American debut of Jenny Lind--the `Swedish Nightingale'--there in 1850. It then served as an immigration processing center, welcoming over 8 million immigrants from 1855 to 1889, prior to the opening of Ellis Island. In 1896, Castle Clinton reopened again as the first American aquarium, designed by the distinguished architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White. Castle Clinton and its aquarium were then partially dismantled in the 1940's, costing New York one of its most treasured venues for cultural and educational enrichment. 
In 1946, Congress established the Castle Clinton National Monument to be administered by the National Park Service. In 1991, I incorporated into the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act an authorization of $2 million for the reconstruction of the Battery's seawall and promenade. I hoped those funds would serve as a catalyst to begin redeveloping Battery Park and implementing a master plan to address the Battery's needs for the 21st century. With his commitment to history and `teaching the public through place,' Roger Kennedy has helped spur that plan, working closely with the Conservancy for Historic Battery Park and its energetic and dedicated president, Warrie Price. 
I know that through his books, documentaries, and dedication to projects such as Battery Park, my friend Roger Kennedy shall continue to educate, inspire, and delight future students of American history, culture, and architecture. I wish him well at his gala tonight and for all the many years to come.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I spoke on Tuesday of this week about recent findings on the technological dimension of the year 2000 computer problem. I rise today to warn of the yet unseen political dimension of the problem. 
Newsweek's June 2d cover story, `The Day the World Shuts Down,' offered a telling scenario in which Vice President Gore, while campaigning for President in 2000, spends all of his time trying to justify why he hadn't addressed this issue. To wit: `imagine Al Gore's spending the entire election campaign explaining why he didn't foresee the crisis.' 
Vice President Gore is not alone here. Imagine 4 to 500 Congressmen doing the same. Come 2000, each of us will be held accountable if we have failed to deal effectively with the `Y2K' problem. Not a single Member of Congress right now, excepting those who can successfully pass the blame, will be absolved. Both parties will face a wholesale clearing of the decks. The deluge of blame will occur in the legal community, as well. Newsweek cited a conservative estimate of 1 trillion dollars worth of litigation resulting from this crisis--more than three times the yearly cost of all civil litigation in the United States. 
Make no mistake, almost all experts agree there will be no `silver bullet' fix. Correcting this problem is labor intensive and very time consuming. Millions of lines of computer code have to be reviewed and changed--in many computer languages so outdated they are foreign to younger programmers. And as Newsweek stated, the bug `affects everything from ATM's to weapons systems. Virtually every government, State, and municipality, as well as every large, midsize, and small business in the world, is going to deal with this--in fact, if they haven't started already its just about too late.' 
If American families are overtaxed by the IRS, improperly charged by their creditors, denied Social Security benefits, and faced with a constantly malfunctioning civil infrastructure, the blame will fall squarely on the shoulders of their Representatives in Washington. 
As Samuel Johnson observed, the prospect of hanging concentrates the mind. This prospect--the political repercussions--could finally get us up and running. We are not now. I have a first day bill, S. 22, creating a joint commission to take on the task as a national emergency. It is just that. No movement on my bill thus far. At this rate be ready to be out of a job in 2001.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the solemn anniversary of the massacre of Chinese students and prodemocracy activists in Tiananmen Square, and to honor the memory of the men and women who were so cruelly murdered by the totalitarian regime of the People's Republic of China. 
No one who witnessed the events will soon forget the images of students and others rallying around the Goddess of Democracy statue, modeled on Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World in New York harbor. 
The Chinese Government has long argued that democracy is inimical to Asian values and that Americans' insistence on human rights is a form of cultural imperialism. The students in Tiananmen Square provided the most compelling refutation of such tripe. 
Our hope that we were witnessing the dawn of a new era in China was dashed when, on June 4, 1989, the so-called People's Liberation Army moved into Tiananmen to thwart the aspirations of the Chinese people. The photograph of one lone Chinese individual--Wang Weilin--confronting a column of 18 PLA tanks is both a tribute to the courage of the Chinese people and a fitting emblem for a regime that believes it can crush ideas with 120 millimeter guns and hold back the tide of history with bayonets. 
I am sorry to say that since 1989, China has continued to silence dissent. So much so that the State Department reported this year that by 1996, `all public dissent against the party and government was effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.' 
On this occasion, let us honor the memory of those who were slain and reiterate our solidarity with Chinese dissidents imprisoned by their government.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, of necessity, I was at the Finance Committee hearing on trade negotiating authority this morning, and so was unable to be on the floor to pay tribute--as so many others have done--to our esteemed colleague, Senator Thurmond, who now holds the record for Senate longevity. But I would like to pay such tribute now. 
Just about 1 year ago--June 13, 1996, to be precise--my daughter Maura and I traveled to the White House for a state dinner in honor of Ireland's president, Mary Robinson, and her husband Nicholas. We stopped at the northwest gate, to be scrutinized by White House security officials. An earnest young man in a uniform peered into our Jeep, studied my face, consulted a clipboard, and then said smartly, `Good evening, Senator Thurmond!' 
A fine compliment, to be mistaken for a man more robust, more vigorous, more irrepressible than individuals half his age or mine! 
I will leave to others the task of highlighting our beloved colleague's absolutely extraordinary private and public lives, which span the 20th century. A few things come to mind which bear mentioning, however. He learned his populist brand of politics from `Pitchfork Ben' Tillman--a man born 150 years ago--whose Senate seat he now occupies. And yet he was just re-elected for the eighth time, again with little difficulty. Senator Thurmond embodies the political and social transformation of the South. 
As a 40-year-old, he volunteered for active duty during World War II and landed at Normandy with the 82d Airborne Division. Immediately after the war, he was elected governor of South Carolina. While governor, in 1948, he ran for president as a States' Rights Democrat and garnered 39 electoral votes. 
He was elected to the Senate in 1954 as a write-in candidate, the first person ever elected to major office by this method. But true to a campaign pledge he made, he resigned in 1956 and stood for re-election. In 1964, he left the Democratic Party and became a Goldwater Republican, presaging--or, perhaps, ushering in--GOP gains in the South that continue to this day. He has served as a delegate to six Democratic and eight Republican National Conventions--a distinction I doubt anyone else shares. Suffice it to say that if Strom Thurmond did not exist, it might be necessary for us to invent him. 
Senator Thurmond has endured the loss of his first wife, the loss of his daughter. But through it all, he has been indomitable. Always optimistic. Unfailingly courteous, the epitome of a Southern gentleman--despite living in our current age, when good manners seem to elude us so readily. I hope he has a sense of the respect and affection we have for him. 
When I think of our colleague, I think of the wonderful poem, `Ulysses', by Alfred Lord Tennyson--one of the great English poets, who, I might add, died a mere decade before Senator Thurmond was born, and I would like to close my tribute with an excerpt from the poem:  
I am become a name; 
For always roaming with a hungry heart 
Much have I seen and known; cities of men 
And manners, climates, councils, governments, 
Myself not least, but honour'd of them all; 
And drunk delight of battle with my peers, 
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy. 
I am a part of all that I have met; 
Yet all experience is an arch wherethro' 
Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades 
For ever and forever when I move. 
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use! 
As tho' to breathe were life! 
No one ever could accuse Senator Thurmond of `rusting unburnish'd'!

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on my recent trip to Israel, I read an illustrative article in the Financial Times of London. It seems financial experts in England have come to a conclusion many financial institutions in the United States have failed, thus far, to reach. Namely, that it is too late to solve the year 2000 computer problem completely, and that it is hopeless to rely on a `silver bullet' to solve the problem. Instead, officials in the United Kingdom have concluded that the world economy faces a very time-consuming, labor-intensive project--the scope of which is unparalleled in modern history. 
Upon my return to the United States, I found that Newsweek had just published an important article that will increase awareness, I hope, to the point of action. Thus, I remind my colleagues of my bill (S. 22) to set up a commission responsible for ensuring that all executive agencies are compliant by 2000. I hope my colleagues recognize--as the British have begun to do--what we now face and what we must do to ensure the proper functioning not only of our Government, but of the economy.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. On April 22, 1997, I introduced S. 625, the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997, along with Senators Joe Lieberman, Mitch McConnell, Slade Gorton, and Rod Grams. S. 625 is designed to reform the Nation's auto-insurance system by giving motorists a low-cost alternative for bodily injury coverage that provides quicker, more comprehensive recovery of economic losses. 
The Auto Choice Reform Act would remove many incentives for fraud, which is endemic to the current auto-insurance system. On Wednesday, May 21, 1997, for instance the Nassau County District Attorney's office arrested 20 people involved in a massive insurance fraud scam. Those arrested by operation backbone included lawyers, chiropractors, and a doctor. Our bill would eliminate many of the incentives that promote this kind of abuse.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as we were voting on various matters this morning, leading to passage of the concurrent resolution on the budget for the fiscal year 1998, which I voted against, I found myself musing of the very different time just 4 years ago when a starkly divided Senate passed a far more stentorian measure than that before us today. In an interval between votes, I wrote to the members of the Finance Committee of that time: 
As we close out this embarrassing budget season, cutting taxes, increasing some spending, promising a balanced budget somewhere in the next century, it might restore a measure of self respect to recollect a not distant time when we knew better and did differently. 
1993. Democrats had won the Presidency and held the Congress. The world was tranquil enough, but our finances were seemingly a wreck. In the twelve previous years the debt had quadrupled and there was no money for anything. On another occasion we can discuss how this came about: I am concerned here with what we did. The Finance Committee (with some help from others) put together and passed, in committee, on the floor, the largest package of tax increases and spending cuts in history. Our purpose was direct and avowed. To show we could govern. The more conservative our critics, the more apocalyptic the pronouncements. Ruin all round was surely at hand. 
In the event, we succeeded beyond imagining. The latest Monthly Treasury Statement shows a booming economy throwing off unexampled revenue. (Recall, a fortnight ago the Congressional Budget Office discovered an additional $225 billion in anticipated revenues for the next five years. Fortuitous, perhaps, but not fake.) A nice detail? Last month the Treasury paid off $65 billion in debt, the largest repayment ever. 
It was all done by the narrowest of margins. Bob Kerrey at the very last moment--he had wanted an even sterner measure. But we did do it. I would like to think it will not now be undone. This is not yet clear. 
The contrast between the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and this legislation is illuminated by an important article that appeared in yesterday's Wall Street Journal under this headline: 
Tax on Wealthy Is Boosting U.S. Revenue Treasury Says 1993 Increase Is Helping Cut the Deficit 
The article, by Michael M. Phillips, reports that the cataclysmic predictions of so many Republicans about the economic effects of the 1993 legislation have not been borne out. To the contrary, as a result of the 1993 act, the deficit as a percentage of GDP 
is at its lowest level in a quarter century, and the expansion is in its 74th month, with full unemployment and little or no inflation. The Treasury is awash with revenue. As Mr. Phillips writes: 
The inflow provides persuasive, if not conclusive, evidence in the continuing debate over the economic impact of the 1993 tax increases, which raised marginal income-tax rates to 35% from 31% on taxable incomes between $140,000 and $250,000, and to 39.6% on incomes above $250,000. 
Which leads to another important point, about which I will again quote the Wall Street Journal: 
The recent flood of revenue pouring into Treasury coffers--enough to push the federal budget to a record $93.94 billion surplus for the month of April--appears to have come mostly from the nation's biggest earners, indicating that the controversial tax increase may indeed be taking from the rich. 
How do we know this? Because the unexpectedly high revenue inflows have come from taxes other than those withheld by employers. These `non-withheld' taxes are mainly paid by wealthier taxpayers, who owe taxes on other income such as stock options, bonuses, and the like. In April, according to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the Treasury took in $110.8 billion in nonwithheld revenues, almost twice what it received in 1992, before enactment of the 1993 legislation. 
It fell to the Finance Committee to assemble the package of spending cuts and, yes, tax increases that would pass the Senate. It was not easy. In the end, we put the bill through without a single Republican vote. One Republican Senator declared on this floor:  
We are buying a one way ticket to a recession * * * When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off. 
It was not pleasant. But we were clear. On June 23, 1993, as the Senate debate on the bill was coming to a close, I put it this way: 
Why do we have to do it, Mr. President? Because after 12 years of mounting deficits and devastatingly increased debt, we are sending a message to the financial markets of the United States and of the world, which now have as much effect on our affairs in a manner never before known because of the debt we have incurred, that we are going to stop it. 
We made the tough choices in 1993, and they have paid off 
handsomely in economic and fiscal dividends. 
Now compare 1993 with what we are doing today. By failing to address the overstatement of the cost of living by the Consumer Price Index, this budget misses a historic opportunity. An accurate cost-of-living index, as recommended by the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index appointed by the Finance Committee--the Boskin Commission--would have saved $1 trillion in 12 years, freeing us from the protracted fiscal crisis of the last two decades. Had we seized the opportunity, we could now be taking on big issues, such as the future of Medicare and Social Security. Instead, the all-consuming quest to reach balance--if only for a moment--in the year 2002 has reduced this to a series of small debates over often derisory sums. 
This budget also fails to address the demographic problems facing our two biggest Federal entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare. These are the serious issues in Federal budgeting, yet this resolution postpones the day when Congress must, inevitably, confront them. Even so, it should be recorded that a correction of 1.1 percentage points in the measurement of the cost of living would in an instant have kept Social Security in actuarial balance until the year 2052. 
This resolution unwisely calls for net tax cuts of $250 billion over 10 years. Coupled with this budget's failure to address long-term entitlement spending, these tax cuts will lead us right back to giant deficits in the outyears. Preliminary estimates, which are just beginning to come in, indicate that in the second 10 years, 2008-2017, the proposed tax cuts could lose in excess of half of $1 trillion. 
Even if one believes, as some do in good faith, that tax cuts are necessary and appropriate at this point, the particular tax cuts agreed to by the White House and the Republican leadership will make for poor tax policy. It is beyond any serious dispute that the proposed reductions in the rate of tax on capital gains will disproportionately go to the very wealthiest taxpayers. Likewise the estate tax relief called for 
in this budget will benefit a tiny fraction--less than 1.5 percent--of estates. And the proposed tax cuts for education, most thoughtful observers agree, could be better spent in ways that would demonstrably help students and their families, such as making permanent the provisions for employer-provided educational assistance. 
Nor does this budget follow the spirit of the 1993 legislation in the area of deficit reduction. The provisions of the 1993 act were initially estimated to reduce the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years; in fact it reduced the deficit by nearly twice that amount. The deficit reduction in the budget before us is questionable; its balance in the year 2002 will be momentary at best. And it makes only feeble, shortsighted choices in tax and entitlement policy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join once again with the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, to reintroduce legislation that will, we believe, help to dispel the fog that sometimes shrouds our discussions of trade policy. This bill would, simply and directly, replace the term `most favored nation' with the phrase `normal trade relations'--a more accurate, less muddled phrase that better describes this fundamental principle of trade policy. 
The concept is well established. It has been traced by historians to the 13th century. More particularly, to a clause in the treaty of November 8, 1226, in which the Emperor Frederick II conceded to the city of Marseilles the privileges previously granted to the citizens of Pisa and of Genoa. Not greater privileges, but merely the same as had been extended to others. 
The term itself--`most favored nation'--dates to the end of the 17th century. And has been nearly as long a cornerstone of American trade policy. Since the 18th century, our trade policy has been grounded on the principle of nondiscrimination: the vast majority of our trading partners receive treatment equal to the treatment we give every other trading partner. In no sense can this fairly be characterized as most favored treatment; rather it is the treatment that we normally accord our trading partners. 
And yet we continue to use that 17th century term in treaties and agreements, in executive orders and in trade laws, a term that, even at the beginning, was a misnomer. There is, Mr. President, no single most favored nation. There never really was. 
As noted in a 1919 report to the Congress by the United States Tariff Commission, known today as the United States International Trade Commission:  
It is neither the purpose nor the effect of the most-favored-nation clause to establish a `most favored nation'; on the contrary its use implies the intention that the maximum of advantages which either of the parties to a treaty has extended or shall extend to any third State--for the moment the `most-favored'--shall be given or be made accessible to the other party. 
That is, the most favored nation is not the nation with which we are negotiating, but rather a third nation altogether that happens to benefit at the moment from lower tariffs or other preferences with respect to some particular product. The most-favored-nation principle means merely that we will grant to our negotiating partner the same terms that we 
have given to that third country, for the moment more favored. 
Little wonder, then, that the term has created confusion. And yet we must continue to discuss the concept for the simple reason that there exists still, in U.S. law, a very unfavorable tariff--the Smoot-Hawley tariff (stemming from the 1930 act of the same name). This was the last tariff schedule enacted line-by-line by the Congress and it produced the highest tariff rates, overall, in our history. It is still on the books, though it applies only to a handful of countries. 
In response to the disaster that followed enactment of the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which, at the time applied to all of our trading partners, Congress authorized the Roosevelt administration to negotiate a series of trade agreements aimed at reducing tariffs worldwide. These efforts culminated in a series of trade agreements with individual countries, and ultimately paved the way for a series of broad multilateral negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that reduced American tariffs, just as they slashed tariffs worldwide. These much lower tariff rates are the tariffs that we call our most-favored-nation tariff rates and they apply, in fact, to the vast majority of countries. They are thus the norm, and not in any way more favorable tariffs. 
They are, indeed, not the lowest tariff rates that the United States applies. We have free-trade arrangements with Canada, Israel, and Mexico that call for the complete elimination of tariffs. We have eliminated tariffs on certain imports from developing countries under the Generalized System of Preferences, from Caribbean nations under the Caribbean Basin Initiative and from Andean countries under the Andean Trade Preferences Act. The tariff rates under these regimes are, in all cases, lower than what we now call our most-favored-nation tariff rates. Hence the confusion, and hence the need to find a more apt phrase. 
Mr. President, this legislation will be familiar to most of my colleagues. The identical bill was introduced in the 104th Congress with the cosponsorship of the entire Finance Committee and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent. I expect that we will be able to repeat that victory in the 105th Congress, and I hope that we can do so promptly. 
Let me underscore that this legislation in no way alters the bedrock principles of equal treatment or nondiscrimination. It merely drops an outdated term in favor of one that ought to help make our trade policy more comprehensible to the American public.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise today to bring to the attention of my colleagues the publication of `The Courage to Stand Alone,' the letters of Wei Jingsheng, a fearless and outspoken dissident currently imprisoned by the People's Republic of China. For two decades Wei Jingsheng has been a leader in the struggle for democracy in China, as well as a passionate advocate of human rights for the people of Tibet. 
Among the many crimes for which Wei has spent the last 18 years in prison, perhaps none is so onerous to his persecutors as his presumption to hold the totalitarian regime of the People's Republic of China to its own standard of law. As Andrew J. Nathan writes in his Foreword: 
Wei's powerful statement of self-defense [at his 1979 trial] exposes how little difference there is between the new legal system and the old absence of a legal system. The prosecutors and judges search for a crime and find none, but they obey orders. They sentence Wei to fifteen years. 
The outside world is outraged, but most Chinese at the time are wiser. They see Wei as the victim of his own naivete. He failed to appreciate the unwritten limits to free speech and legal reform. He committed the greatest offense in a dictatorship: taking words at face value. 
The Courage to Stand Alone serves as a testament of resistance to the totalitarian phenomenon so brilliantly dissected in our century by the likes of Hannah Arendt and George Orwell. Wei's letters stand as the literary equivalent of the famous photograph of the lone Chinese individual confronting a column of tanks during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. 
In his letter of June 15, 1991 Wei writes:  
It is precisely because human rights are independent of the will of the government, and even independent of the will of all mankind, that people fight for the realization and expansion of human rights as a natural and unprovoked matter of course. They gradually come to the realization that the more widespread and reliable the protection of human rights is, the more their own human rights are protected. Just as man's understanding of objective truths and objective laws is a gradual process, man's understanding and comprehension of human rights is a gradual process. Just as man's grasp and utilization of objective laws is a progressive process, man's protection of the theory and practice of human rights is a progressive process. 
Wei Jingsheng--by his words and conduct--has done much to advance our understanding of human rights in China and throughout the world. I commend `The Courage to Stand Alone' to all Senators, and I look forward to the day when Wei Jingsheng will again be free to stand together with other Chinese dissidents who struggle to bring a measure of democracy to their ancient and long-suffering homeland.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to record and to celebrate Robert D. Novak's 40 years of Washington journalism, as he himself records this morning in a Washington Post column `What a Change 40 Years Makes.' Forty years in journalism, as he writes, `an association with Congress that continues today.' An association of rare civility and, too often alas, of deadly accuracy. His access, energy, good spirits, and rage for the truth are equaled only by his lifelong friend and partner Rowland Evans. Top Drawer and Front Page, there has never been the like of them, and I choose to think never will be, for there are some national treasures that truly are unique. 
Senators will note Mr. Novak's observation that `The capital city of 1957 was at once shabbier and far better governed than today's glittering but pothole-scarred Washington.' A concise way to make the point that as American Government has reached for beyond its grasp on so many social issues, it has accepted an appalling decline in the fundaments of good government, such as street paving. He notes that in 1957 Congress itself `was vastly less imperial. Admission to the Capitol and office buildings was open, without the need for photo ID cards and security checks.' One might add our buildings were not surrounded by concrete barriers and guardposts. One could even go so far as to note that one could even drive down Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. That thoroughfare having now been blocked off. Albeit, ever alert to the need for austerity it has, in its eastern reaches at 15th Street, been turned into a parking lot complete with parking meters. 
I came to Washington in 1961 with the Kennedy administration. Bob Novak was a force for government openness even then. Irresistible as a friend and devastating as an analyst. Why only last week he revealed to an unwary world that the proposal for a more accurate cost of living adjustment in Federal finances was the `culmination of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's masterful campaign to perpetuate big government * * *' 
No matter, just so long as his concern over big Government serves to perpetuate Bob Novak. Let us agree for at least a half century. Let hope, as indeed we may, that his beloved Geraldine will see to this. 
He fought for his nation as a lieutenant during the Korean war and has been fighting for it ever since.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Monday of last week, Murray Kempton died. With his passing, we mark the end of a legend in New York, and in American journalism. Kempton was the kindest man and toughest reporter we have known in our time. A certain incandescent sweetness now departs. Yet his memory and, yes, his legacy remain. 
The Daily News' columnist Sidney Zion captured Kempton's unique ability and thus legacy when Zion wrote: `Kempton used his power to condemn, but loved his right to absolve. And when he absolved the sinner, he owned the territory.' 
This was Kempton's singular power. With characteristic flair, Kempton would challenge corruption with voracity. Then instead of reveling in victory, would show compassion for the humans beneath the deeds and absolve the sins of some of the greatest losers in New York's history. Carmine DeSapio, Alger Hiss, Carmine Persico, Roy Cohn. Such was the power of the words which Kempton wielded. 
When the reformers in the City had finally overcome DeSapio, one of the great Tammany bosses, Kempton wrote, as only he could: `The age of Pericles had begun because we were rid of Carmine DeSapio. One had to walk carefully to avoid being stabbed by the lilies bursting in the pavements. I wish the reformers luck--with less Christian sincerity than Carmine DeSapio does. I will be a long time forgiving them on this one.' Kempton felt sympathy and respect even for the rogue. He stood up for the loser whether it was Carmine DeSapio, a deposed dictator, or a shunned local New Yorker. 
J. Edgar Hoover once called Mr. Kempton a snake and a rat. From one who was once referred to by Mr. Hoover as a skunk, I take pride in knowing that my work was seen in the same light as Kempton's. But I fear no one else has what the Washington Post called, `[Kempton's] skeptical sympathy' required to continue his work. 
The Age of Kempton is over. Budding writers would do well to re-read and emulate his work; public figures continue to thank and rue the day Kempton chose them to be subject of his column; and for we who knew him, only sorrow bursts through the cracks in our hearts today.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as I am sure many of my colleagues are aware, this week--May 4-May 10--is Arson Awareness Week. All over the Nation, people are coming together to combat arson and take back their communities. One such place where this has been happening is Utica, a city of about 70,000 people in upstate New York. Utica is a pilot city in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's [FEMA] Partnership for Arson Awareness and Prevention. FEMA Director James Lee Witt is heading up the National Arson Prevention Initiative [NAPI], a combined effort of FEMA and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Justice, and the Treasury. President Clinton asked Director Witt to create the NAPI in response to the many church fires which recently occurred in the South. 
In March, Utica Mayor Edward Hanna and Oneida County Executive Ralph Eannace formed a local arson prevention coalition and have been working with FEMA officials. Throughout this week and in the future, the people of Utica will band together to take back their city from scourge of arson fires which it has recently seen. 
On Tuesday, students at the Martin Luther King School heard a public education program on arson from officers of the Utica Fire Department and the New York State Office of Fire Prevention. On Wednesday, risk assessments were conducted at senior citizen's centers, and on Friday, the Utica National Insurance Co's. are presenting a fire prevention grant to residents of the neighborhood near the intersections of South and Steuben Streets. 
On Saturday, Director Witt will cap off the week with a visit to Utica. The day's activities will include boarding up abandoned structures to make them less susceptible to arson and conducting fire drills at several churches in the morning and having a parade and arson prevention rally in the afternoon. I would like to thank Director Witt for making Utica a pilot city in this program and for visiting Utica. Working together, the people of Utica will reclaim their city from arson.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to Senator Hollings' amendment to allow the Bureau of the Census to plan for sampling in the 2000 census. In that year the Bureau proposes to count each census tract by mail and then by sending out enumerators until they have responses for 90 percent of the addresses. The Bureau proposes to then use sampling to count the remaining 10 percent of addresses in each tract, based on what they know of the 90 percent. This would provide a more accurate census than we get by repeatedly sending enumerators to hard-to-count locations and would save $500 million or more in personnel costs. 
The census plan is supported by the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council, which was directed by Congress in 1992 to study ways to achieve the most accurate population count possible. The NRC report finds that the Bureau should: make a good faith effort to count everyone, but then truncate physical enumeration after a reasonable effort to reach nonrespondents. The number and character of the remaining nonrespondents should then be estimated through sampling. 
The supplemental appropriations bill would prohibit the Bureau from planning for a census that includes sampling, and would even prevent the Bureau from planning to send out the long form, from which we get crucial and legally required information about education, employment, immigration, housing, and many other areas of American life. The long form gives us a detailed picture of the populace that we cannot do without. 
Mr. President, the taking of a census goes back centuries. I quote from the King James version of the Bible, chapter two of Luke: `And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed [or enrolled, according to the footnote] . . . And all went to be taxed, everyone into his own city.' The early censuses were taken to enable the ruler or ruling government to tax or raise an army. 
The first census for more sociological reasons was taken in Nuremberg in 1449. So it was not a new idea to the Founding Fathers when they wrote it into the Constitution to facilitate fair taxation and accurate apportionment of the House of Representatives, the latter of which was the foundation of the Great Compromise that has served us well ever since. 
The Constitution says in Article I, Section 2: 
 Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other persons. The actual enumeration shall be made within three years of the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such manner as they shall direct by law. 
Opponents of sampling often say that the Constitution calls for an `actual enumeration', and this requires an actual 
headcount rather than any statistical inference about those we know we miss every time. However, numerous lower court rulings have found that it is permissible under the Constitution to use sampling. When the New York case was decided last year, the Supreme Court found that the decision by the Secretary of Commerce not to adjust the 1990 census for the undercount was a reasonable choice in areas where technical experts disagree, and within the discretion granted to the Federal Government. The opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist stated that `We do not decide whether the Constitution might prohibit Congress from conducting the type of statistical adjustment considered here.' So it appears to be left to the executive and legislative branches to decide how best to count the populace. 
I note that we have not taken an actual enumeration the way the Founding Fathers envisioned since 1960, after which enumerators going to every door were replaced with mail-in responses. The Constitution provides for a postal system, but did not direct that the census be taken by mail. Yet we do it that way. Why not sample if that is a further improvement? 
Sampling would go far toward correcting one of the most serious flaws in the census, the undercount. Statistical work in the 1940's demonstrated that we can estimate how many people the census misses. The estimate for 1940 was 5.4 percent of the population. After decreasing steadily to 1.2 percent in 1980, the 1990 undercount increased to 1.8 percent, or more than 4 million people. 
More significantly, the undercount is not distributed evenly. The differential undercount, as it is known, of minorities was 4.4 percent for blacks, 5.0 percent for Hispanics, 2.3 percent for Asian-Pacific Islanders, and 4.5 percent for Native Americans, compared with 1.2 percent for non-Hispanic whites. The difference between the black and nonblack undercount was the largest since 1940. By disproportionately missing minorities, we deprive them of equal representation in Congress and of proportionate funding from Federal programs based on population. The Census Bureau estimates that the total undercount will reach 1.9 percent in 2000 if the 1990 methods are used instead of sampling.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by my colleague from New York to extend Supplemental Security Income [SSI] benefits to elderly and disabled legal immigrants through the end of September. Under last year's welfare legislation, which I opposed, these individuals are to lose their SSI benefits in August. The budget agreement recently reached would restore SSI benefits to many of these individuals. I support that effort, although more should be done. This amendment will ensure that there is no interruption of SSI benefits while legislation necessary to implement the budget agreement is considered. 
It is a welcome measure of compassion where there has been too little of late.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms, in introducing the Government Secrecy Act of 1997. Congressmen Larry Combest of Texas and Lee Hamilton of Indiana are introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives this afternoon. The four of us, along with eight other distinguished individuals, served for the past 2 years on the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. 
Earlier today, the four of us testified together at a hearing of the Committee on Governmental Affairs called by Chairman Thompson to review the Commission's report, issued in March. The legislation that we introduce today is intended to implement one of the core recommendations of that Commission: The need for a statute establishing the principles to govern the classification and declassification of information. The remarks that follow track my testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee this morning. 
We begin by defining our subject. `Secrecy is a form of government regulation.' It can be understood in terms of a now considerable literature concerning how organizations function. Begin with the German scholar Max Weber, writing eight decades ago in his chapter `Bureaucracy' in `Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft' (Economy and Society): 
Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration always tends to be an administration of `secret sessions'; in so far as it can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism. The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional interests make for secrecy. The concept of the `official secret' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond these specifically qualified areas. 
Normal regulation concerns how citizens are to behave. As the administrative state developed in the United States, beginning with the Progressive Era at the turn of the century and expanding greatly under the New Deal, legal scholars began to ask just what these new rules were. Were they laws? If not, then what? In 1938, Roscoe Pound, chairman of the American Bar Association's Special Committee on Administrative Law and former Dean of the Harvard Law School, attacked those `who would turn the administration of justice over to administrative absolutism . . . a Marxian idea,' and inveighed against those `progressives, liberals, or radicals who desire to invest the National Government with totalitarian powers in the teeth of constitutional democracy . . .' 
We managed to get a handle on that system, in no small measure through the efforts of Erwin Griswold, also a dean of the Harvard Law School, and others who decried the fact that administrative regulations equivalent to law had become increasingly important to everyday life and yet were not available to the public. One year after Professor Griswold published a seminal article calling for the publication of such rules and regulations, Congress enacted the Federal Register Act of 1935. Eleven years later, in 1946, working from the recommendations made in 1941 by the Attorney General's Committee on Administrative Procedure, chaired by Dean Acheson, Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act. 
Thus, today our system of public regulation is public indeed. Regulations are both widely accessible and subject to the APA's set of procedural requirements--bringing a degree of order and accountability to this regime. 
Secrecy, by contrast, concerns what citizens may know, but the citizen does not know what may not be known. Our Commission states: 
Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other areas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know the extent or the content of the regulation. 
Thus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does not even know that he or she is being regulated. It is a parallel regulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it malfunctions. 
Flowing from this understanding of secrecy as regulation is the recognition that, to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart's opinion in the Pentagon Papers case, when everything is secret, nothing is secret. We state: 
The best way to ensure that secrecy is respected, and that the most important secrets remain secret, is for secrecy to be returned to its limited but necessary role. Secrets can be protected more effectively if secrecy is reduced overall. 
It is time to reexamine the foundations of that secrecy system. The Information Security Oversight Office report to Congress last week estimated the direct costs of secrecy at $5.2 billion in 1996 alone. The same Office reports that in 1995 we had 21,871 original new top secret designations and another 374,244 derivative top secret designations. Meaning that, in a single year, roughly 400,000 new secrets were created at the Top Secret level alone--the disclosure of any one of which would cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. 
It is also time to examine the appropriateness of security arrangements put in place during an earlier age, when the perceived threats were so different from those of today. In 1957, the only previous commission established by the Congress to examine the secrecy system--the Commission on Government Security--issued a report that, for any number of reasons--in particular the fact that its core recommendation that amounted to prior restraint of the press--did nothing to change the prevailing mode. Although the Commission did understand classification as a cost; its report `stresses the dangers to national security that arise out of overclassification of information which retards scientific and technological progress, and thus tend to deprive the country of the lead time that results from the free exchange of ideas and information.' 
When the Commission on Government Security presented its report to President Eisenhower and the Congress, we still were consumed with concerns about a Federal Government infiltrated by ideological enemies of the United States. Today, the public and its representatives have few such concerns; indeed, today it is the U.S. Government that increasingly is the object of what Edward Shils in 1956, in `The Torment of Secrecy,' termed the `phantasies of apocalyptic visionaries.' 
We are not proposing putting an end to secrecy. It is at times terribly necessary and used for the most legitimate reasons. But secrecy need not remain the only norm: We must develop a competing culture of openness, fully consistent with our interests in protecting national security, but in which power is no longer derived primarily from one's ability to withhold information. 
I am struck in this regard by a most remarkable letter that I received on March 25 from George F. Kennan, professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ, in response to our Commission report. As lucid and thoughtful as ever at age 93, Professor Kennan builds a compelling case for the proposition that much of our secrecy system arose out of our efforts to penetrate the obsessively secretive Soviet Communist regime of the Stalin era. And that the system we put in place remains largely intact today, even as that adversary has disappeared. Professor Kennan writes:  
It is my conviction, based on some 70 years of experience, first as a government official and then in the past 45 years as an historian, that the need by our government for secret intelligence about affairs elsewhere in the world has been vastly over-rated. I would say that something upwards of 95% of what we need to know about foreign countries could be very well obtained by the careful and competent study of perfectly legitimate sources of information open and available to us in the rich library and archival holdings of this country.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a very special American, Ms. Elizabeth O'Donnell of Kenmore, NY. I am proud to announce that Ms. O'Donnell is one of three winners of the 1996 HEROES Awards from the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. This honor is given each year to three individuals who make outstanding and unique humanitarian contributions to local sports programs throughout the United States. 
In 1976, Elizabeth O'Donnell abandoned her lifelong dream of professional ice skating to find a more fulfilling challenge. It was at that time that Ms. O'Donnell left the Ice Capades to teach blind and handicapped people of all ages to ice skate. Motivated by her love of the sport and desire to share the freedom of movement, as well as the physical and psychological benefits which accompany skating, Ms. O'Donnell founded the Skating Association for the Blind and Handicapped [SABAH]. 
In her 20 years as coach, administrator, and president of SABAH, Ms. O'Donnell has taught more than 8,500 physically challenged people to leave behind their wheelchairs and crutches and learn to skate with specially designed walkers and harness systems. A number of Ms. O'Donnell's students have even learned to overcome their disabilities as a result of her coaching techniques. 
Ms. O'Donnell's work might best be summarized in the words of Buffalo mayor, Anthony Massielo, the person who nominated her for the 1996 Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association HEROES Award: `For those people who might have known `sports' as an abstract, Elizabeth has succeeded in translating the joy of achievement and accomplishment, which is so often overlooked in competitive sports, into a triumph of spirit.' 
Mr. President, I want to give my warmest congratulations to Ms. O'Donnell and to the people whose lives she helps make better. Her 1996 Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association HEROES Award is richly deserved.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, founded in 1847, Plymouth Church of Brooklyn, NY, has made significant contributions to the Nation. The church building, designated in 1963 by the U.S. Department of the Interior as a national historic landmark, was known as the `Grand Central Depot of the Underground Railroad' because of the antislavery activities of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher and the congregation. 
Reverend Beecher was familiar with the horrors of slavery auctions from his own observation and from experiences of members of his family, including his sister Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote `Uncle Tom's Cabin.' Thus, on several occasions between 1848 and 1860, he conducted well-publicized mock slave auctions at Plymouth Church with the results that the congregation secured the freedom of the slaves and he demonstrated to the Nation the barbarity of selling people who had been created, according to the Bible, `in the image of God.' These auctions helped create a pro-abolitionist consensus in the North. 
In February of 1860, Abraham Lincoln, then relatively unknown east of the Appalachians, was invited to speak at Plymouth Church. At the last moment, the location of the speech was changed to Cooper Union where Lincoln made an address which introduced him to the eastern United States which, in turn, led to his nomination for the Presidency less than 3 months later. Lincoln worshiped at Plymouth Church on two occasions, the only times he attended church services in New York State. 
Following the end of the Civil War, the congregation of Plymouth Church supported the position that women and black men should have the right to vote. Even after the 15th amendment to the Constitution gave newly emancipated black men the right to vote, Plymouth Church continued to advocate for the right of women to vote. Reverend Beecher was the only man ever to serve as president of the American Suffrage Society. 
Reverend Beecher left an impact on other areas of American cultural life. He was among the first religious leaders in the United States to embrace Darwin's theory of evolution and Spencer's theories of social evolution. He was an early advocate of Jewish-Christian dialog and of giving public standing to Judaism as a major American faith group. 
Because the church was for many years the largest and best known public building in Brooklyn, many notable persons have spoken there, including Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Clara Barton, and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Mark Twain, who described Plymouth Church's 1867 grand tour of Europe and the Holy Land in his book `Innocents Abroad,' also spoke there. 
In 1934, Plymouth Church and neighboring Church of the Pilgrims merged to form Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims. On May 4 of this year, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of Plymouth Church and the commencement of the ministry of Rev. Henry Ward Beecher. I wish to add my congratulations to the Reverend Sharon Power Blackburn; Frank Decker, president of the Plymouth Council; and the entire congregation of Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims on this most important occasion.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution of ratification. I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to put this matter in a historical context. 
Since its development by 19th century chemists, poison gas--as it was known--has been seen as a singular evil giving rise to a singular cause for international sanctions. 
In May 1899, Czar Nicholas II of Russia convened a peace conference at The Hague in Holland. Twenty-six countries attended and agreed upon three conventions and three declarations concerning the laws of war. Declaration II, On Asphyxiating or Deleterious Gases stated: 
The Contracting Parties agree to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases. 
Article 23 of the Annex to the Convention added: 
In addition to the prohibitions provided by special Conventions, it is especially forbidden:

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last year, the President and Congress enacted welfare legislation which I said was welfare repeal, not welfare reform. At that time, researchers at the Urban Institute estimated 2.6 million people would fall below the poverty line because of the legislation, 1.1 million of them children. The same researchers projected that 3.5 million children would be dropped from the rolls in 2001 because of the time limits contained in the legislation. 
During the debate last year, there was little attention given to the provisions concerning the eligibility of legal immigrants for benefits. These immigrants have come to America legally. They pay taxes and serve in our military. Yet the new law eliminates the eligibility of these immigrants--should misfortune strike them--for SSI and food stamps, and it severely limits their eligibility for TANF and Medicaid. Many legal immigrants affected by these restrictions are elderly. In my own State of New York, they might be frail disabled survivors of the Holocaust, or refugees from the former Soviet Union who are about to lose their only means of support. This situation has come to our attention now because it is among the first parts of the bill to be implemented. 
The President has proposed restoring eligibility for SSI to those legal immigrants who become disabled after entering this country. He has also proposed permitting refugees and asylees additional time before becoming subject to the various restrictions, in light of the difficult circumstances under which they arrive on our shores. I support these proposals, although I regret that enactment of the welfare repeal law has made this new legislation necessary. 
I am pleased to join with colleagues of both parties in introducing legislation to continue SSI and food stamp benefits to those legal immigrants already receiving them and to permanently exempt refugees and asylees from the eligibility restrictions. This is a good first step in addressing the immediate and pressing needs of these immigrants, and I urge our fellow Senators to join us in this effort. It represents the beginning of a bipartisan discussion on how to address this issue, and I commend the legislation to the Senate.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997, a bill submitted by my distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell. 
This legislation is designed to create a new option in auto insurance for consumers who would prefer a system that guarantees quick and complete compensation. This alternative system would change most insurance coverage to a first-party system from a third-party system and it would separate economic and noneconomic compensation by unbundling the premium. Therefore, drivers would be allowed to insure themselves for only economic loss or for both economic and noneconomic loss. 
In the 1950's, I first became interested in the issue of auto insurance reform as a member of New York Gov. Averell Harriman's Traffic Safety Policy Coordinating Committee. At that time, while working on auto safety issues, I became convinced that as the number of automobiles increased, the number of automobile accidents would, inexorably, also increase. And the problem with the current state of the insurance system begins right there. A driver buys protection against the risk that he will negligently cause an accident that will injure another person. If that should occur, the driver's insurance company is responsible for compensating the victim. But this contradicts the very nature of traffic accidents. If they were orderly events, in which cause and effect could be clearly discerned and ascribed, then the present insurance system could work. But accidents are nothing of the sort. It is often very difficult to determine fault in traffic accidents. It is the role of the liable party's insurance company to argue that the plaintiff's injuries--no matter how hideous--are not as serious as he or she claims. These cases overwhelm the court system and in so doing, they prevent real justice from occurring. Justice is possible only when it is done quickly and reflects the sense of what is right and what is wrong, as I wrote in `Next: A New Auto Insurance Policy,' which appeared in the August 27, 1967 New York Times magazine: 
The most serious secondary effect of the existing insurance system, however, lies in its impact on the courts. This process begins with the use of the police to enforce the traffic laws, as a result of which the incidence of arrest by armed police in the United States is the highest of any society in history. The jam starts there, and is followed by a flood of accident litigation cases that derive, in part at least, from the original criminal case. We have now reached the point where accident litigation accounts for an estimated 65 to 80 percent of the total civil court cases tried in the United States. This in turn has brought us to the point where delays in justice here are the longest of any democracy on earth. It now takes an average of 30.1 months to obtain a jury trial in the metropolitan areas of the nation. In Westchester and Kings counties, it is 50 months plus. In Chicago it is 60 months plus. 
A legal expert in the field, James Marshall, has argued that persons involved in or witnessing an automobile accident are not really capable of reconstructing it in court. The event is too complex, and levels of perception too low. (How would a witness to a shooting respond to a question as to which way the bullet was traveling?) A fortiori the attempt to reconstruct such an episode three, four, or five years afterward is nigh impossible. Thus the question must be asked whether a social concern of the highest order--the administration of justice--is not being sacrificed to one of a much lower priority, the reenactment of traffic accidents. (As indeed the whole cops-and-robbers, shoot-'em-up paradigm for managing the road system must be questioned. It was not just chance that the riots in Watts and Newark began with police arresting a motorist.) 
There is little likelihood, however, that greater efforts toward the administration of justice--more judges, or whatever--would change matters. A New York survey has shown that of 220,000 annual claims of victims seeking to recover damages caused by another's fault, only 7,000 reach trial, and 2,500 reach verdict. Given the number and rate of accidents in the existing transport system, a kind of Malthusian principle governs the courts: the number of litigated cases will automatically increase to use up all the available judicial facilities and maintain a permanent backlog. At a time when issues of justice, violence, and civic peace are of immediate and pressing concern, to devote the better part of the judicial (and an enormous portion of the legal) resources of the nation to managing the road system is the kind of incompetence that societies end up paying for. 
Only one adult response is possible: the present automobile insurance system has to change . . . 
In that article, 30 years ago, I proposed two alternatives to traditional tort coverage as solutions for the problem. One was to have the Federal Government provide insurance--financed by a penny or so increases in the Federal gasoline tax--for injuries and economic losses, with claims being adjusted in a fashion similar to the workers' compensation system. The second alternative was along the lines of the current legislation. For the past 35 years, Jeffrey O'Connell, the Samuel McCoy Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, has been figuring out the permutations of this second type of reform. It is his recommendations that shape today's legislation. 
Over 16 million motor vehicle accidents occur every year. The average amount of time it takes to receive compensation for losses in a tort case is over 18 months. Minimally injured parties are overcompensated while victims of serious injuries often fail to receive full restitution. According to a study by the RAND Institute, people with economic losses of under $5,000 receive over two to three times that amount in compensation. People with $25,000 to $100,000 worth of losses, however, currently are compensated for just over one-half of their losses, on average. The very seriously injured--those with economic losses of over $100,000--receive compensation worth only 9 percent of their damages, on average. The current system does not work. 
This legislation is called Auto Choice because drivers would have a choice between this new system, called personal protection insurance [PPI], or they could remain insured under the system currently operating in their State--the tort maintenance system [TM]. For people who choose to insure themselves for only economic damages, this is akin to a $243 tax cut, according to a recent report by the Joint Economic Committee, only without any impact on the Federal budget. Our legislation would ensure more complete and more rapid recovery of losses for the people who incur them, and it would reduce the number of cases that presently overwhelm the courts. 
I thank my friend from Kentucky for inviting me to cosponsor this legislation, and hope other Senators agree with us that the time for auto choice has come.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. I commend the President for his decision to invoke investment sanctions on Burma, in accordance with section 570 of Public Law 104-208. The President deserves praise for his action. Conditions in Burma remain grim and warrant this limited measure. 
Perhaps no one is more deserving of praise than the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. He and I have stood together in support of the people of Burma for many years now and I congratulate him for his steadfast efforts to assist in achieving a democratic transition in Burma. 
Burma is a democracy denied. It is a country with a democratic past. With our help it can have a democratic future. We find ourselves at a point in history where numerous nations are struggling to build democratic governments. It is not always an easy process. Those who are involved in such transitions watch for America s response to situations such as we find in Burma, where a military junta prevents the implementation of a democratic election. Let us be clear. This is not only about human rights and trade. This is about our commitment to democracy. 
There are those who argue that constructive engagement is the only way to effect change in a country. Constructive engagement is a euphemism for doing business with thugs. Foreign investment in Burma provides hard currency for the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC]. Most U.S. companies refuse to support such a regime through foreign investment. Amoco, Levi Strauss, Liz Claiborne, Macy's, Eddie Bauer, Columbia Sportswear, Oshkosh B'Gosh, Pepsi, Apple Computer, and many other companies already have cut business ties with Burma. I commend the President for his action which supports the decisions of these responsible companies. 
Finally, I would note that this is not an end to our efforts in Burma, but a beginning. Strong bilateral pressure needs to be supplemented with multilateral action. I call on other nations which share our concern for the people of Burma to join us. Most importantly, the SLORC should know that we will remain vigilant and continue to defend the rights of Burmese democracy leaders.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I submit a concurrent resolution congratulating the residents of Jerusalem and the people of Israel on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of their historic capital. I am joined in this effort by my distinguished colleague from Florida [Mr. Mack] as well as by 68 other Senators. 
Next week, Jews around the world will conclude their Passover Seders with one of mankind's shortest and oldest prayers: `Next year in Jerusalem.' Throughout the centuries Jews kept this pledge, often sacrificing their very lives to travel to, and live in, their holiest city. The Jewish people's attachment to Jerusalem is as ancient as it is fervent. 
That Jerusalem is, and should remain, Israel's undivided capital would seem an unremarkable statement, but for the insidious campaign--begun in the 1970's--to delegitimize Israel by denying her ties to Jerusalem. For too long, the United States acquiesced in this shameful lie by refusing to locate our Embassy in Israel's capital city. As long as Israel's most important friend in the world refused to acknowledge that Israel's capital city is its own, we lent credibility and dangerous strength to the lie that Israel is somehow a misbegotten, an illegitimate, or transient state. 
On November 8, 1995, the Jerusalem Embassy Act became the law of the United States. The law states, as a matter of United States Government policy, that Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel, and should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected. 
The concurrent resolution I submit today continues in this spirit, and in the spirit of the many previous resolutions I have authored on this subject. In 1990, I introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, which stated simply: `Jerusalem is and should remain the capital of the State of Israel.' In 1993, in a message to the American-Israel Friendship League, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin wrote: 
In 1990, Senator Moynihan sponsored Senate Resolution 106, which recognized Jerusalem as Israel's united Capital, never to be divided again, and called upon Israel and the Palestinians to undertake negotiations to resolve their differences. The resolution, which passed both Houses of Congress, expressed the sentiments of the United States toward Israel, and, I believe, helped our neighbors reach the negotiating table. 
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process faces difficult challenges at this time. It is my hope that this clear reiteration of U.S. policy on Jerusalem will help insure that Jerusalem will remain a city at peace and bring closer the day when it will once again become a symbol of peace for all humanity.

Unauthorized browsing of confidential tax information undermines the confidence of taxpayers, and such behavior ought to be subject to criminal penalties--which it will be under this bill. 
This legislation is a product of the bipartisan efforts of the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the Senator from New York, among others. I join my chairman in urging its prompt enactment.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise with Senators Lautenberg and Lieberman and a distinguished group of my colleagues today to introduce the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997. This bill is designed to reauthorize, with some modifications and improvements, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. ISTEA is an innovative law that addresses the fundamental imbalance in national transportation investment, and in so doing, serves to promote intermodalism, improve mobility and access to jobs, protect the environment, empower local communities, and enhance transportation safety. 
ISTEA spurred the Federal Government and the States to invest their transportation dollars in whatever modes were most efficient for moving people and goods and to solicit the input of local communities in planning those investments. The result was a dramatic increase in investment in maintenance and rehabilitation of existing roads and bridges, in mass transit, and in creative approaches to our transportation needs, from bicycle and pedestrian paths to ferry boats. 
When I introduced the original ISTEA legislation in 1991, I had only four Senate cosponsors--Quentin Burdick of North Dakota, Steve Symms of Idaho, John Chafee of Rhode Island, and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey. The bill I introduce today has broad bipartisan and grassroots support, with 31 Senate cosponsors from across the country joining me. We have learned a lot over the last 6 years. 
In 1991, my House counterpart Robert A. Roe of New Jersey, then chairman of the Public Works Committee, and I had hoped to develop a Federal highway bill that would mark the end of the era of interstate highway construction. That era had brought the nationwide, multilane, limited access highway system, as first envisioned at the General Motors Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World's Fair, and then advanced in 1944 by President Roosevelt. The New York State Thruway was the system's first segment. In fact, the civil engineer who built it, Bertram Tallamy, left Albany in 1956 to start up the national program in Washington with funding from a dedicated tax proposed by President Eisenhower and approved by Congress that year. 
But by 1991 the interstate system was essentially done and Chairman Roe and I confronted the question, `What now?' 
We developed three principles for the first highway bill to mark the post-interstate era. First, the primary objective was to improve efficiency of the transportation system we already had. Second, the time had come to turn the initiative in transportation matters back to the States and cities. Third, transit was to be an option for cities. 
I am proud to say we achieved our three principles and more. 
The Interstate Highway System left a big mark on American cities, where the majority of the funds were spent. I wrote in The Reporter in 1960: 
It is not true, as is sometimes alleged, that the sponsors of the interstate program ignored the consequences it would have in the cities. Nor did they simply acquiesce in them. They exulted in them . . . This rhapsody startled many of those who have been concerned with the future of the American city. To undertake a vast program of urban highway construction with no thought for other forms of transportation seemed lunatic. 
The results often were. American cities were cruelly split, their character and geography changed forever, with interstate highways running through once-thriving working class neighborhoods from Newark to Detroit to Miami. Homes and jobs were dispersed to the outlying suburbs and beyond. The wreckage was something to see. Some cities have used ISTEA funds to try to repair the damage where they could, using funds for transit--even bike and pedestrian paths--instead of more road building. Or with plans such as Boston's Central Artery, a project that will reunite some of that city's most historic and colorful neighborhoods, separated for almost 40 years by an elevated highway. 
Today, I ask that we continue to build upon our success with ISTEA, changing it only as needed. The bill we introduce today retains the basic structure of ISTEA, which distributes funds primarily on needs balanced with such factors as historical shares, but updates outmoded formulas and streamlines the equity adjustment programs. The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 also 
increases flexibility for States by allowing them to use some of their transportation funding to support Amtrak. This is the first step this year in meeting our commitment to address Amtrak's long-term funding needs. 
The ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 reauthorizes all the program categories of the original legislation--the National Highway System, the Interstate Maintenance Program, the Highway Bridge Rehabilitation and Replacement Program, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, the Surface Transportation Program, the Interstate Highway Reimbursement Program, and the Transportation Enhancements Program--at a total funding level of $26 billion, which can be fully supported by the Highway Trust Fund. 
While the ISTEA Reauthorization Act increases funding for all the program categories, I want to mention three programs in more detail. The bill strengthens the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, funding it at $2 billion annually, with a portion of the authorized amount to be distributed on the basis of population residing in fine particulate non-attainment areas. The CMAQ program, which has allowed States and municipalities to find creative solutions to improving air quality and reducing traffic congestion, has been an ISTEA success story, resulting in impressive improvement in U.S. air quality over the last few years. 
The bill also increases funding for the Highway Bridge Rehabilitation and Replacement Program to $3.75 billion per year. The success of the Bridge Program is dramatic--in four years, there has been a 15 percent drop in deficient bridges--from 111,200 in 1990 to 94,800 in 1994. I believe broad consensus exists to strengthen this important program that has already done so much to preserve our existing bridge infrastructure. 
Finally, the ISTEA Reauthorization Act fully funds the Interstate Highway Reimbursement Program at $2 billion per year. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for the Federal Government to fund the construction of the Interstate Highway System with a Federal-State share of 90-10. At that time a number of States had, at their own expense, already constructed a total of 10,859 miles of highways that later became part of the Interstate System. 
As a result, Congress tasked the Bureau of Public Roads with determining the cost of reimbursing States for those segments, and the Bureau arrived at a figure of $5 billion in 1957 dollars. ISTEA used that figure, adjusted to $30 billion in 1991 dollars, and established a 15-year repayment schedule. The ISTEA Reauthorization Act retains this program, which is a matter of basic equity and provides urgently needed funds for those highways that are the oldest and among the most heavily used portions of the Interstate System. 
These programs are essentially, but I do hope that as Congress considers reauthorization of ISTEA, we can ask the question once again, `What now?' 
Congress must focus on increasing the U.S. investment in transportation infrastructure. The United States has watched our European and Asian competitors finance and build innovative transportation infrastructure that is the envy of the world. As the budget process gets underway this year, we will need innovative financing ideas to leverage scarce Federal dollars and address our chronic multi-billion dollar underinvestment in U.S. roads, bridges, rails, ports, and transit systems. 
We must also search for new technologies and innovations--like Magnetic-Levitation trains [maglev] and Intelligent Transportation Systems [ITS]--to solve our congestion and air quality problems without pouring ever more concrete. The railroad represents an early 19th century technology, the automobile an early 20th century technology; we need new modes of transportation for the next century. 
Today, maglev trains run in Bremen, but not in New York, where the maglev concept was first conceived in 1960 by a young Brookhaven scientist, James Powell, as he sat mired in traffic on the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge. In truth, today most of the meager Federal transportation research and development resources are going for improvements in existing highways, and not into other modes such as rail and transit, where I suspect we can achieve much greater economic and environmental returns. 
As we determine the course for this bill, I also wish to address the so-called donor State issue. To distribute Federal transportation funds primarily 
upon the ability of each State to collect fuel taxes, as advocated by representatives of the donor States, would run counter to whole concept of federalism, which is based on collecting national resources to address national needs. When California has an earthquake, or Florida has a hurricane, or the Mississippi River floods its banks, the entire Nation addresses these needs, without considering whether the needed funds were raised in the affected States. Every other Federal program--from crop supports to water reclamation projects to airport improvement grants--distributes funds on the basis of need. 
For example, in response to the Savings & Loan crisis, the Resolution Trust Corp. was formed to help bail out depositors, but each State did not contribute according to the amount of dollars lost in that State. If such an approach had been taken, Texas alone would have faced costs of over $26 billion, while the cost to New York would have been only $3 billion. Under our Federal system, which allocates national resources to meet national needs, the taxpayers of New York shouldered a significant portion of Texas's burden. The cosponsors of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act, most of them from donor States in the larger scheme of the balance of Federal payments, reject the idea that gasoline taxes should be distributed according to where they are collected. 
Furthermore, some of the highway bill proposals put forth this year, which distribute up to 60 percent of transportation funding on the basis of where the gas taxes were collected, thwart our national environmental efforts. These bills reward States with high gas consumption, and punish States that conserve fuel and invest in mass transit. Under these proposals, a State that invests in a new bus or rail line, or in other improvements that reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality, would receive less transportation money as gas consumption falls. 
As a Nation we have made clean air and reduced dependence on foreign oil two major priorities--these bills threaten to undo the progress we have made. In 1944, the United States exported oil. In 1956, we imported only 11.5 percent of consumption. Today, we import nearly 50 percent of the oil we consume. It could be said that the biggest single effect of the Interstate Highway System has been in the field of American foreign policy. We are a nation that absolutely must have foreign oil, and must shape our defense and foreign policies accordingly. We must strive to keep that dependency to a minimum. The sponsors of the ISTEA Reauthorization Act of 1997 are committed to that goal. 
We are also committed to working with other Members, including our distinguished colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, Senators Warner and Baucus, who have both put forth their own proposals for reauthorizing ISTEA. Each coalition's bill reflects, to a greater or lesser extent, the interests of its own member States and regions, and I am confident that all will ultimately contribute to a transportation bill that best serves the Nation.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Communications Workers of America [CWA] has recently elected Larry Mancino as the new vice president to lead CWA District 1, the largest region in the union. As a fellow native of New York City, I am pleased by Mr. Mancino's election to vice president. 
Most significant, Mr. Mancino made it to the top of the CWA District 1 the old-fashioned way. He earned it! For more than 30 years, he has been a dedicated trade unionist, serving as a rank-and-file activist before advancing to the union's national staff. In 1991, he was promoted to assistant to CWA President Morton Bahr, the position he held prior to his election as vice president. 
Mr. President, there are revolutionary changes occurring in the telecommunications industry as the United States approaches the 21st century. The convergence of computer and telephone technology is transforming not only how our citizens communicate with each other, but also how Americans communicate with the world. 
In this turbulent time of transition in the telecommunications field, the CWA members in district 1 are fortunate that Larry Mancino is an innovative leader who can confront the challenges that workers in the telephone industry face. 
I wish the CWA members in New York and throughout district 1 well as they journey forward under the proven leadership of Larry Mancino.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to state that this is a fine moment in the history of the Senate. It has come about through the leadership of Senator Robert C. Byrd and his devotion to the Constitution of the United States. The court today ruled in the most explicit terms. It said, `* * * the Act effectively permits the President to repeal duly enacted provisions of Federal law. This he cannot do.' 
Then with a grace note that I hope the Senate will appreciate, and I know our distinguished occupant of the chair will, with Senator Byrd's great attachment to the history of democratic government and theory and its glorious origins in Greece, the court referred to the sword-of-Damocles effect: Not that the President would exercise this power, but that he might do it. There is a sword still suspended in this Chamber, but soon, I cannot doubt, to be taken down as a consequence of the judgment of the Supreme Court. I might add, sir, that there are some in Congress who are concerned that the courts interfere too much with our procedures. This is a court defending the Constitution and the U.S. Congress in its responsibilities.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise today to speak about the city of Jerusalem, a subject I have spoken about at some length and on numerous occasions during my tenure in the United States Senate. In the not too distant future, the people of Israel will celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the reunification of their Capital. It is altogether fitting and proper that the United States Congress should mark this anniversary with an appropriate resolution. 
For 3,000 years Jerusalem has been the focal point of Jewish religious devotion. Although there had been a continuous Jewish presence in Jerusalem for three millennia--and a Jewish majority in the city since the 1840's--the once thriving Jewish population of the historic Old City of Jerusalem was driven out by force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. From 1948 to 1967 Jerusalem was divided by concrete, barbed wire, and cinder block. Israelis of all faiths and Jews of all nationalities were denied access to holy sites in the area controlled by Jordan. 
Jerusalem was finally reunited by Israel in 1967 during the conflict known as the Six Day War. Since then, Jerusalem has been a united city in which the rights of all faiths have been respected and protected, and persons of all religious faiths have been guaranteed full access to holy sites within the city. 
In 1990, I sponsored Senate Concurrent Resolution 106, which was overwhelmingly adopted by the United States Senate, while a similar resolution (H. Con. Res. 290) was adopted by the House of Representatives. These resolutions declared that Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, `must remain an undivided city' and called on the Israelis and the Palestinians to undertake negotiations to resolve their differences. The late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin credited S. Con. Res. 106 with `[helping] our neighbors reach the negotiating table' to produce the historic Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on September 13, 1993. 
In the fall of 1995, I joined with Senator Dole to introduce `The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995' (Public Law 104-45) which states as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel. I firmly believe that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected, as they have been by Israel during the past thirty years. 
I congratulate the people of Israel on the approaching thirtieth anniversary of the reunification of their historic capital. When the Senate reconvenes next month, I will introduce a resolution to commemorate this event, as I have done on previous anniversaries.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, nearly 100 years ago, in March of 1901, the Senate Committee on the District of Columbia was directed by Senate Resolution to `report to the Senate plans for the development and improvement of the entire park system of the District of Columbia * * * (F)or the purpose of preparing such plans the committee * * * may secure the services of such experts as may be necessary for a proper consideration of the subject.' 
And secure `such experts' the committee assuredly did. The Committee formed what came to be known as the McMillan Commission, named for committee chairman Senator James McMillan of Michigan. The Commission's membership was a `who's who' of late 19th and 20th-century architecture, landscape design, and art: Daniel Burnham, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., Charles F. McKim, and Augustus St. Gaudens. The Commission traveled that summer to Rome, Venice, Vienna, Budapest, Paris, and London, studying the landscapes, architecture, and public spaces of the grandest cities in the world. The McMillan Commission returned and fashioned the city of Washington as we now know it. 
We are particularly indebted today for the Commission's preservation of the Mall. When the members left for Europe, the Congress had just given the Pennsylvania Railroad a 400-foot wide swath of the Mall for a new station and trackage. It is hard to imagine our city without the uninterrupted stretch of greenery from the Capitol to the Washington Monument, but such would have been the result. Fortunately, when in London, Daniel Burnham was able to convince Pennsylvania Railroad president Alexander Cassatt that a site on Massachusetts Avenue would provide a much grander entrance to the city. President Cassatt assented and Daniel Burnham gave us Union Station. 
But the focus of the Commission's work was the District's park system. The Commission noted in its report:  
Aside from the pleasure and the positive benefits to health that the people derive from public parks, in a capital city like Washington there is a distinct use of public spaces as the indispensable means of giving dignity to Government buildings and of making suitable connections between the great departments * * * [V]istas and axes; sites for monuments and museums; parks and pleasure gardens; fountains and canals; in a word all that goes to make a city a magnificent and consistent work of art were regarded as essential in the plans made by L'Enfant under the direction of the first President and his Secretary of State. 
Washington and Jefferson might be disappointed at the affliction now imposed on much of the Capitol Grounds by the automobile. 
Despite the ready and convenient availability of the city's Metrorail system, an extraordinary number of Capitol Hill employees drive to work. No doubt many must. But must we provide free parking? If there is one lesson learned from the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, it is that free goods are always wasted. Free parking is a powerful incentive to drive to work when the alternative is to pay for public transportation. As we have created parking spaces around the Capitol, such as the scar of angle-parked cars at the foot of Pennsylvania Avenue made available `temporarily' during construction of the Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building, demand has simply risen to meet the available supply. The result--the Pennsylvania Avenue spaces have become permanent and a portion of the Nation's main street remains an aesthetic disaster. 
Today, I am reintroducing legislation to complete the beautification of the Capitol Grounds, as envisioned by the illustrious McMillan Commission in 1901, through the elimination of most surface parking and restoration of the sites as public parks. The Arc of Park Capitol Grounds Improvement Act of 1997 would require the Architect of the Capitol to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to improve the Capitol Grounds through the creation of an `arc of park,' sweeping from Second Street, NE to the Capitol Reflecting Pool and back to First Street, SE, with the Capitol Building as its approximate center. Delaware Avenue between Columbus Circle and Constitution Avenue would be closed to traffic and rebuilt as a grand pedestrian walkway from Union Station to the Capitol. The angled parking would be eliminated on Pennsylvania Avenue between First and Third Streets, NW, and the Pennsylvania Avenue tree line would be continued onto the Capitol Grounds. 
There is, of course, the matter of parking. This legislation authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to construct underground parking facilities, as needed. These facilities, which will undoubtedly be expensive, will be financed simply by charging for the parking. A legitimate user fee. In the matter of parking, this legislation is an appropriate companion to a bill that my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, and I introduced earlier today, which will enable employers to provide their employees with cash compensation in lieu of a parking space. This bill, which was also included in the Administration's ISTEA reauthorization proposal, will expand employee options for commuting and reduce auto use.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I will vote against both the Republican and the Democrat resolutions. 
I hold that the Attorney General should appoint an independent counsel to investigate alleged improprieties by Democrats and by Republicans in fundraising for the 1996 Presidential and congressional campaigns. I believe the public will only be reassured if an independent counsel looks into what has been happening. The issues must be aired in an independent, nonpartisan setting. And if there have been violations of law, there must be consequences. 
Last week, after much debate, the Senate agreed to fund the Governmental Affairs Committee probe into illegal and improper fundraising and spending practices in the 1996 Federal election campaigns. A unanimous Senate believed that a credible investigation requires that we look not only at our President, but also at ourselves. So, too, should an independent counsel. 
Senate Joint Resolution 22 suggests that the scope of the independent counsel's investigation should be limited to the allegations of wrong-doing by Democrats in the 1996 Presidential campaign. There is no mention of an investigation of congressional campaigns. 
Senate Joint Resolution 23 does not call for the appointment of an independent counsel. To say again, in my view, an independent counsel is the only entity capable of conducting an investigation without dissolving into partisan bias. And it is the only way of proceeding that avoids the appearance of conflict of interest.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, to introduce the Clinton administration's legislation to re-authorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, or ISTEA. 
I applaud the administration's proposal as a sincere effort to reauthorize ISTEA under the principles of intermodalism, environmental protection, sound community planning, and safety, that have made this innovative transportation act work so well these past 6 years. I do not agree with all of the details of administration plan--the formulas used to distribute funds to each State based on the Federal fuel taxes collected in that State are an unfortunate departure from the need-based formulas in all other Federal programs. The President's proposal, however, preserves the basic ISTEA framework and represents a good starting point as we begin considering the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
I also intend to join with a bipartisan group of colleagues later this month to introduce our own proposal to re-authorize ISTEA. This proposal would reauthorize the key provisions of ISTEA--which was crafted to promote intermodal, economically efficient, and environmentally sound incentives in Federal transportation policy--through more fully needs-based formulas. 
ISTEA has worked, and its reauthorization will be more important for the economy than any other transportation bill since the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956. Our goal should be now to make a good law better.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be introducing legislation with the chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Roth, to correct an unintended item contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. I want to thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue and associate myself with his statement. 
Mr. President, it recently came to our attention that Internal Revenue Code section 168(j), a provision intended to help attract private industry investment to Indian reservations and similar lands that continue to be held in trust for Indian tribes and their members is benefitting private investment on `former Indian reservations' having no current connection to any Indian tribe. As a result, we are introducing legislation today that would correct the definition of `Indian reservation,' under Internal Revenue Code section 168(j)(6), so that these tax incentives are available only for businesses operating on Indian reservations and similar lands. 
Mr. President, it is important to note, as Chairman Roth did, that we wish to take into consideration any Indian lands that may technically not fall within the definition of `Indian reservation,' under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, but which should be made eligible for these special investment incentives. Such situations should be brought to the attention of the tax-writing committees, and we will then consider further modifications as the bill moves through the legislative process.

The bill I introduce today is identical to S. 122, the previously introduced version of the STADIA bill, in all respects save one. The new version, rather than generally applying to bonds issued on or after the date of first committee action, as specified in S. 122, will be effective generally for bonds issued on or after the date of enactment. 
On February 27, during the floor debate regarding the reinstatement of the airport and airway trust fund taxes, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, raised an objection to the majority leader's request that the aviation tax bill be taken up and passed. Senator Specter's objection was based on his concerns about the effective date of S. 122. In view of the importance of the aviation tax legislation, which is critical to the funding of air safety measures, I agreed to revised the effective date of my bill. Senator Specter then withdrew his objection to passage of the aviation tax legislation, which the Senate proceeded to pass by unanimous consent.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday, March 10, marked the 38th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising, at a time when many Tibetan citizens gave their lives to defend their freedom and to prevent the Dalai Lama from being kidnaped by the Chinese Army. For those who stand with the Tibetan people, it is a day to consider what can be done to lend support to their aspirations. The United States Senate will mark the occasion by adopting this resolution Senate Resolution 19, introduced on the first day of the 105th Congress, condemning the egregious prison sentence imposed by the Chinese Government on Hgawang Choephel. The Foreign Relations Committee has considered the measure and unanimously reported-out the resolution last week. 
Mr. Choephel, a Tibetan ethnomusicologist and Fulbright Scholar, returned to Tibet in July 1995 to prepare a documentary film about traditional Tibetan performing arts. He was detained in August 1995 by the Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for over a year before the Government of the People's Republic of China admitted to holding him, and finally charged him with espionage in October 1996. 
On December 26, 1996, the Chinese Government sentenced Ngawang Choephel to an 18-year prison term plus 4 years subsequent deprivation of his political rights following a secret trial. This is the most severe sentence of a Tibetan by the Chinese Government in 7 years. 
The imprisonment of Ngawang Choephel reflects the broader conflict between Tibetans and Chinese. Mr. Choephel's arrest, and harsh sentence, appear to stem from his collecting information to preserve Tibetan performing arts. Such treatment of Tibetans is indicative of the extreme measures the Chinese Government continues to take to repress all forms of Tibetan cultural expression. To the Chinese Government, which views Tibetan religion and culture as an impediment to successfully unifying Tibet with the `motherland,' such efforts are reactionary. As we have seen, they are so threatening that Mr. Choephel has been sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for his efforts. The New York Times editorial on January 2 explains: 
The basis of Ngawang Choephel's conviction is unclear, but even taping Tibetan culture for export could qualify as espionage under Chinese law. Since its invasion of Tibet in 1950, Beijing has gradually increased its efforts to erase Tibet's identity. China has arrested those who protested the takeover and tried to eradicate the people's affection for the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama. 
My first encounter with this transcending issue came with my appointment as Ambassador to India a near quarter-century ago. In 1975, along with my daughter Maura Moynihan, I visited China as a guest of George Bush, who was then Chief of our U.S. Liaison Office in Peking. By this time, I was persuaded the Soviet Union would break up along ethnic lines. But I was not prepared for 
the intensity of ethnic tensions in the People's Republic. One was met at the Canton railroad station by a giant mural of Mao surrounded by ecstatic non-Chinese peoples who occupy more than half the nominal territory of the People's Republic. In Beijing, 3-year-olds in the Neighborhood Revolutionary Committee of Chi Eh Tao nursery school sang a patriotic song for us which began: 
We will grow up quickly to settle the border regions. We will denounce and crush Lin Piao and Confucious 
A refrain which ended: 
We will each grow a pair of industrial hands. 
Much of that Stalinoid dementia has disappeared from the coastal regions of China, at least for the moment, but not from Tibet. My daughter Maura has traveled to Tibet several times. After her most recent trip last year, she wrote in the Washington Post of the Chinese assault on Tibetan religion and culture: 
Beijing's leaders have renewed their assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with an alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama. 
The resolution before us records the United States Senate's response to these Chinese policies. We reject Chinese efforts to `erase Tibet's identity' and their `assault on Tibetan culture.' Tibetans must be free, not only to preserve their identity and culture, but to determine their future for themselves. 
In the words of the International Commission of Jurists in 1960, `Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law.' The Government of the People's Republic of China should know that as the Tibetan people and His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet go forward on their journey toward freedom the Congress and the people of the United States stand with them. 
I thank all my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. In particular I would like to recognize the long commitment that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee Senator Helms, has shown in support of Tibetans and thank him for joining me in this effort today. I would also thank both Senators from Vermont, who have remained engaged in this matter since it was made known and for their joining me as a cosponsor of this measure.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise, as is so frequently and pleasantly my lot in this Congress, to support entirely the major statement made by the chairman of the Committee on Finance, our revered Bill Roth of Delaware. 
As he stated just now, this proposal for a waiver, a very technical matter, a prudent matter, comes to the floor of the Senate as a unanimous action of the Committee on Finance. Just last week, we had a revenue measure which also came to the Senate with the unanimous agreement of the Finance Committee and was duly enacted and is now, in fact, law. The President signed that measure. 
We are acting today at the request of the administration, which has a very proper principled concern that if there is any question about the application of this statute, then let that question be resolved by a waiver, which is what we are doing. 
In the specific instance, Mr. President, as an attorney in practice here in Washington, Ambassador Barshefsky provided legal advice to the Government of Quebec on softwood lumber countervailing measures--I do not fully claim to understand that--and to the Government of Canada itself. 
As the chairman has observed and noted--was she seeking to influence actions here in the Congress? She gave legal advice. I cannot but doubt that there are any number of solicitors in Ottawa who provide advice to American firms on trade matters between the United States and Canada. We, after all, have enjoyed a free trade agreement for nearly a decade and more and have been the closest economic partners for a century and more. 
The capacities that Ambassador Barshefsky brings to this job are formidable to the point of being dazzling. She is a master of the subject and has a capacity for advocacy of the American position and American interests that is surely unequaled in our time. The chairman referred to one of her predecessors, Carla Hills, who was equally distinguished in this manner. 
There has not been a more dramatic example of American diplomacy--because we are talking about relations between nations--at its finest. When the much-announced, much-proclaimed agreement on telecommunications last year found the other nations unwilling to make the kind of reciprocal agreements that we required which were in our interest and where there were times when negotiators from any country, including our own, would settle for less than what might be appropriate in order to get an agreement, Ambassador Barshefsky did no such thing. Charlene Barshefsky did no such thing. She walked out of the conference, only to come back in the recent weeks with a triumphant telecommunications agreement of the very highest importance to this country. 
She did it because she is a firm representative of the U.S. interests and can be someone of just a little hard edge when that seems important. Her arrival in a place like Singapore is front page news. I hope she would not mind that on certain Asian missions she is referred to as the `Dragon Lady,' although she has disarming, personable qualities. She is a tough negotiator. 
I make this point simply because there is one overriding issue upon us right now--as a trading nation, as the world's largest trading nation, and the sponsor of the World Trade Organization--and that is, as the chairman indicated, the terms on which the People's Republic of China will be granted admission to the World Trade Organization, the terms which are going to make it be the real test of that organization. And it will be decisive to its future. 
It started well. It took a long time to get going. As the chairman knows, in the Dumbarton Oaks agreements that were reached with the United Kingdom at the end of World War II, we contemplated there would be three major international institutions: The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which we know as the World Bank; the International Monetary Fund; and the International Trade Organization--three international organizations, the latter to advance the reciprocal trade programs that had begun in 1934 under Cordell Hull and the administration of President Roosevelt after the calamity of the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. 
The World Bank was duly established. The International Monetary Fund was duly established. The International Trade Organization fell afoul, came to grief, if you will, in the Senate Finance Committee. And so it was a matter of some institutional satisfaction to the committee in the 103d Congress to report out the legislation in which we joined, as had been negotiated, the Uruguay Round, the World Trade Organization to succeed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which had a much more limited, although indispensable, role in the period that followed our rejection of the ITO. And now we have the World Trade Organization. 
The terms on which you enter this agreement and have membership in this organization require an economy and economic 
practices very much disparate, very much at a distance, if that is the correct term, from those practices and that economy which we observe in the People's Republic of China. 
The terms on which entry can be negotiated are going to be complex and crucial. And we need a negotiator who can say no. The one thing Beijing needs to understand is that they will be across the table, or at a round table, in Geneva with a negotiator who can say `No, period.' Other than that, I think prospects for a successful, perhaps staged, entry are good. It certainly should not be dismissed. But it must be understood we are not going to reach agreement for agreement's sake, and to that end we have confirmed in the U.S. Senate the appointment of a U.S. Trade Representative who can say, no--will do, has done. 
So, Mr. President, I have the great honor to join with our chairman in this unanimous action of the Committee on Finance in reporting to the floor this proposal for a waiver just to be on the safe side of the legal question that might arise--and will not when we are finished today--and also, of course, the nomination of the Ambassador which will follow in executive session. 
I see my colleague from Iowa is on the floor. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I rise simply to endorse, with fullest conviction, the statement of the chairman in this matter, and to emphasize, if I may be allowed, that executive agreements can never override statute. If they do, they are null and void, and the courts will so hold. 
For us even to suggest that that might be possible would be to introduce into our governmental administrative arrangements matters of ambiguity and doubt and uncertainty that would have the capacity to incapacitate what has turned out to be an extraordinarily successful procedure in world trade. 
It has taken us 60 years--63 from the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934--to reach a point where we are the world's largest trading nation and leading the way in these matters in the world and hugely respected for that and known to have the capacity to negotiate when the Congress gives that authority to the President. The subsequent negotiations are executive agreements. If any part of them should, by inadvertence or intention, be contrary to present statutory law, they are null and void. That proposition must never be put into question as I fear this matter before us might do. 
I yield the floor and thank the Chair.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this afternoon, the Senate will vote for the third time in 2 years on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Two years ago, during our first debate on this amendment, I argued that 
[T]here is nothing inherent in American democracy that suggests we amend our basic and abiding law to deal with the fugitive tendencies of a given moment. 
My point was that a series of one-time events in the 1980s had given rise to our recent fiscal disorders, and that a constitutional amendment was an inappropriate and indeed unnecessary response. 
Enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 had, after a decade of reckless deficit spending, returned us to a path of fiscal responsibility. At the time of its enactment, OBRA 93 was estimated to bring about $500 billion in deficit reduction over 5 years. Three and one-half years later, estimates are that the total deficit reduction under the 1993 legislation will be more like $924 billion. So we are on the right track. 
In fact, we are even closer to a balanced budget than one might imagine--and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution has nothing to do with how to achieve it. 
A balanced budget is easily within reach, if only we have the courage to seize the opportunity soon. In January 1996 and again in January 1997, I proposed a simple plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. In addition to recommendations that were generally in both the President's budget proposal and the budget proposals offered by the Republicans, my plan requires only two actions: 
First, correct by 1.1 percentage points the overindexation of Government programs and tax laws; and 
Second, postpone tax cuts. 
That is all that needs to be done. It is all that ought to be done. It is not the time for tax cuts. Nor it is the time for crippling cuts in domestic discretionary spending. A correction of 1.1 percentage points, as recommended in December by the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index appointed by the Finance Committee, or the Boskin Commission as it has come to be known, would save $1 trillion in 12 years --and it would put Social Security into actuarial balance until the year 2052. 
The economics profession is behind this proposal, as is the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Dr. Alan Greenspan, who testified before the Finance Committee on January 30 of this year. Dr. Greenspan's own estimate of the overstatement of the cost of living by the Consumer Price Index is 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points per year, which is quite close to the estimate of the Boskin Commission. Notably, referring to the familiar argument that the decision to correct cost of living adjustment factors should not be politicized, Dr. Greenspan had the definitive response: not to act, given the overwhelming evidence that the CPI is an upwardly biased measure of inflation, is the political fix. 
Let us be absolutely clear about the direction of this bias. BLS Commissioner Katharine Abraham acknowledged at a February 11 Finance Committee hearing that the CPI is `an upper bound measure on change in the cost of living.' 
So there is broad agreement in the economics community. And encouragingly, it appears we are close to agreement in Congress and the Executive Branch. Last week, Majority Leader Lott suggested that the appointment of a panel of graybeards on the issue was in order. The President immediately said he would take the Leader's suggestion under advisement. Then on Friday, in a meeting with editors and reporters at the Washington Post, OMB Director Franklin Raines expressed support for Senator Lott's proposal. Director Raines noted that the `CPI is a very accurate price index, while only being an okay cost of living index.' And now in this morning's New York Times, there is an article by Richard W. Stevenson headlined `Clinton Wants Deal With Congress on Cost-of-Living Adjustments.' It begins: 
President Clinton gave his aides the go-ahead today to try to forge a deal with Congress to reduce cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other benefit programs, White House officials said. 
This is an important step forward by the Administration. Getting an accurate 
measure of the cost of living is the right thing to do, and it is the only way to put our fiscal affairs in order. 
I should add that although this issue has reemerged only recently, the fact that the CPI overstates the cost of living is not a new understanding. I came to Washington with the Kennedy Administration 35 years ago. Upon our arrival in 1961, we had waiting for us a report by a National Bureau of Economic Research committee on `The Price Indexes of the Federal Government.' The committee was headed by George J. Stigler, who went on to win a Nobel Prize in economics. The report noted that: 
If a poll were taken of professional economists and statisticians, in all probability they would designate (and by a wide majority) the failure of the price indexes to take full account of quality changes as the most important defect in these indexes. And by almost as large a majority, they would believe that this failure introduces a systematic upward bias in the price indexes--that quality changes have on average been quality improvements. 
Mr. President, I hope we don't allow this moment to pass us by. It is the right thing to do, and we ought to do it soon. We could have a balanced budget plan in place and forget this foolishness about amending the Constitution. 
If you don't think it is foolish, ask any economist. Last month, as the Senate began this debate, more than 1,000 economists, including 11 Nobel Prize winners, signed a statement imploring Congress to reject Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The economists wrote: 
We condemn the proposed `balanced budget' amendment to the federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary. 
The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-called `built-in stabilizers' limit declines of after-tax income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced every year would aggravate recessions. 
May I say, to paraphrase Santayana, that we may be condemned to repeat an awful period in our history if this amendment is adopted. The historical precedent is chilling: in 1930, 1,028 economists implored President Hoover to veto the Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation. He ignored their pleas, with disastrous consequences. A 60 percent drop in trade; worldwide depression; the rise of totalitarian regimes; and in the wake of such events, the Second World War. 
Now, with the list of signatories growing, the economics profession is again pleading with us to reject this constitutional amendment. If we defeat the amendment, we will preserve the sanctity of our Constitution and promote economic stability. If we adopt it and it is ratified by the states, we will return to the dark ages of economic policy, having disregarded 60 years of social learning. 
As I indicated earlier, a great part of the rationale for the balanced budget amendment has been the problem of deficits and the rising national debt. Yet our problems with deficits are quite recent, having been generated in the relatively brief period of the 1980's. These deficits marked a sharp departure from the fiscal problems of earlier administrations, which were directed primarily to the problem of a persistent full employment surplus, with its accompanying downward pressure on consumer demand. 
The full-employment budget concept was explained by then-OMB Director George P. Shultz in his fiscal year 1973 budget:  
. . . expenditures should not exceed the level at which the budget would be balanced under conditions of full employment. 
Which is to say that in the absence of full employment, as was the case in fiscal year 1973, the Federal Government should deliberately contrive to incur a deficit equal to the difference between the revenues that would actually come in at levels of underemployment, and those that would come in at full employment. Far from being inevitable and unavoidable, there were points in the business cycle where a deficit had to be created. Otherwise surpluses would choke off recovery. 
The term `full employment surplus' had originated earlier. The January 1962 report of the Council of Economic Advisers explained that as the recovery from the recession of 1958 got underway, economic activity grew and so did the revenues of the Federal Government. But Congress would not spend the additional revenue. As a result, the recovery stalled. This untoward event was ascribed to `fiscal drag.' 
Beginning in 1980, the Reagan White House and Office of Management and Budget set about creating a crisis by creating deficits intended to force Congress to cut certain programs. In a television address 16 days after his inauguration, President Reagan said: 
There were always those who told us that taxes couldn't be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know we can lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of voice and breath. Or we can cut their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance. 
Haynes Johnson wrote of this in `Sleepwalking Through History: America Through the Reagan Years' (1991). I will simply quote a footnote on page 111: 
[Stockman's] former mentor Moynihan was the first to charge that the Reagan Administration `consciously and deliberately brought about' higher deficits to force congressional domestic cuts. Moynihan was denounced and then proven correct, except that the cuts to achieve balanced budgets were never made and the deficits ballooned even higher. 
The point is that the huge deficits and debt of the 1980's were intentional and anomalous, and therefore the balanced budget amendment is an inappropriate response. A balanced budget amendment would undo all that we have learned about economic policy over the past six decades--a lesson that can be easily seen in the fluctuations of the business cycle over the last 125 years. We had enormous volatility in economic activity prior to 1945--volatility that would be unacceptable today. For example, in 1905, output increased by 9.2 percent, to be followed 2 years later by declines of 1.6 and 5.5 percent in 1907 and 1908 respectively, and an increase of 11.7 percent in 1909. Output increased by 16.2 percent in 1916 and by 7.7 percent in 1918, to be followed by 3 consecutive years of negative growth. And then, of course there was the Great Depression. After increasing by 6.4 percent in 1929, output fell by 8.9 percent in 1930, another 7.8 percent in 1931, and then a further decline of an incredible 13.3 percent in 1932. After World War II all this changed, following a brief adjustment period, as the country converted from a wartime to peacetime economy. Since then the largest reduction in output was 2.3 percent in 1982. 
In the 1970's, I asked Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Charles L. Schultze to analyze what would have happened if a balanced budget amendment had been in force in the middle of the 1975 recession. He reported back that the computers at the Council `blew up.' GDP--then called GNP--would have dropped another 12 percent in an economy in which output was already 5 percent below capacity. During the debate in the last Congress, this simulation was repeated by the Treasury Department and by our minority Finance Committee staff, with the same results. With a balanced budget amendment, a moderate recession in which the unemployment rate increases by 2-3 percent becomes a major contraction--may I say depression--in which unemployment soars over 10 percent and output falls by 15 percent or more. In the entire post-World War II era the unemployment rate exceeded 10 percent only for a brief 10 months during the 1981-82 recession. 
Just as importantly, a balanced budget amendment would undo the progress we have already made, which I referred to earlier. Two years ago, in arguing against House Joint Resolution 1, I noted: 
As a result of the deficit reduction policies [put in place by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993] we have had three straight years of deficit reduction--the first such string of declines since the administration of Harry S. Truman. Here are the numbers: FY 1992 $290.4 billion; FY 1993 $255.1 billion; FY 1994 $203.2 billion; OMB 1995 est., $192.5 billion; and CBO 1995 est. $176 billion. 
As I have said, our progress has been even better than expected. Remarkably, the deficit for fiscal year 1995 was lower than projected: $163.8 billion compared to projections of $176-$192 billion. The fiscal 1996 deficit is even lower--$107.3 billion, just 1.4 percent of GDP, resulting in 4 consecutive years of deficit reduction. And, for the first time since the 1960's, we have a primary surplus--that is, excluding interest payments, revenues exceed outlays. 
Adoption of a balanced budget amendment--which as I said last year would be tantamount to `writing algebra into the Constitution'--can only jeopardize the progress we have made. We can and will complete the job of balancing the budget without this amendment. It would be disastrous for our economy, and I hope it will once again be defeated.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Young Israel of Flatbush, a major modern Orthodox synagogue in Brooklyn, NY, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary on March 2, 1997. 
Young Israel of Flatbush has been intensely involved, and provided extraordinary leadership, on the local, national, and international scenes. It has anchored the enormous development of the Flatbush community in which it is located, which is well noted for its commitment to communal service. The Young Israel has long stood for the classic Jewish religious values which are among the shared principles of American democracy. In particular, the Young Israel has emphasized through the years aid and assistance to the needy, both at home and abroad. 
During most of its 75-year history, Young Israel has been served by two outstanding spiritual leaders, Rabbi Solomon J. Sharfman who retired in 1984 after 45 years of service, and Rabbi Kenneth Auman, who currently occupies the pulpit. Through their distinguished leadership, in collaboration with a succession of lay partners, the Young Israel of Flatbush has been a source of strength in all aspects of civic and Jewish life, and at age 75, retains the vigor and optimism of a young congregation. 
I am certain the Members of the Senate join me in saluting the rabbis, members, and officers of the Young Israel of Flatbush on this auspicious occasion and wish them continued success in every endeavor, sacred and temporal.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is the first bill passed by the Committee on Finance in the 105th Congress, and characteristically, it was adopted by unanimous vote. I would point out that 6 of the 10 major pieces of legislation reported by the Senate Finance Committee during the 104th Congress also were passed unanimously. We are off to a good start in the Finance Committee this year, and I hope we maintain this fine tradition under the able leadership of Senator Roth. 
We are here today because the taxes levied to finance the airport and airway trust fund have expired. These taxes largely support the operations of our Federal Aviation Administration, including our Nation's air traffic control system. They also finance our airport improvement program, providing grant money for important airport equipment and infrastructure improvements. Collection of these taxes is critical to maintaining and improving our national air transportation system and continuing to fund airport modernization projects, aviation safety enhancements, and airport security efforts. 
On February 4, the Finance Committee held a hearing on the status of the trust fund, which we found to be critical. There is an unexpected shortfall in the trust fund. The Treasury Department had transferred estimated trust fund excise tax receipts to the trust fund based upon an assumption--now known to be inaccurate--regarding the timing of tax receipts. The Treasury Department was required to reverse this transfer, and we are informed that a correcting transfer of almost $1.2 billion has been made. 
The trust fund will be depleted much sooner than expected, which has consequences. FAA informs us that while the air traffic control system will be funded through the end of the fiscal year, funds for FAA capital programs will be depleted in March. If we do not act promptly, FAA will be forced to halt new airport improvement grants, and to cancel contracts that are designed to improve airports and airway systems in every part of the country. These programs could include better bomb detection equipment, improvements for better communication between pilots and controllers, and safety and security studies. 
The Finance Committee under Chairman Roth's leadership moved quickly. One day after our hearing, we unanimously reported out a bill to extend the trust fund taxes through the end of the fiscal year, or September 30, 1997, and to allow Treasury to transfer trust fund tax receipts to the trust fund, no matter when the taxes are collected. 
The House has now passed identical legislation. It therefore falls to us in the Senate to pass this bill, promptly and without amendment, and to send it to the White House for the President's signature.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Sidney W. Dean was a man devoted at once to the public and to the private. Before he passed away last month at the age of 91, he had worked for 41 years toward the cause of good government in New York, while at the same time becoming one of the city's strongest advocates of free speech and the right to privacy. 
He will doubtless be remembered as longtime trustee, president, and chairman of the City Club of New York, but perhaps as much so as an advocate of using the emerging technology of cable television as a way for those who are poor and ignored to be seen--and heard. 
Long before most others, he saw the potential power of television pressing the city to require cable companies to provide public access channels. He met with some success, though perhaps not exactly what he had envisioned. Few things turn out that way. 
His devotion to free speech was instilled in him by his father, a newspaper editor. A member of the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans for Democratic Action, he took up the cause, helping to keep New York what it has always been: the center of the world of ideas and the free exchange of information.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Saturday, February 1, Wilcomb Washburn, a champion of unfashionable truths and a scholar in the truest sense of the word, died here in Washington. He had retired as director of the Smithsonian's American Studies Program exactly a month before, on January 1, after almost 40 years at the institution. He was 72 years old. 
He remained dedicated, most especially, to the integrity of academic life and to keeping the spirit of free inquiry from being compromised by politics. Perhaps more than anyone else, he recognized the grave threat posed by the politicization of scholarly professional associations. 
Last year I had the honor to present him with the National Association of Scholars' Sidney Hook Award in recognition of his work. In his acceptance speech, he quoted the sociologist James Coleman, the first recipient of the Hook Award: `The greatest enemies of academic freedom in the university are the norms that exist about what kinds of questions may be raised in research.' Coleman was nearly expelled from the American Sociological Association for his findings on the effect of home and neighborhood environment on learning. Wilcomb Washburn had a vision of the academy as a place that would live up to the ideal of the open society in which no claims on truth are more privileged than others. As he said in his acceptance speech that day `let us hope that those who have chosen to speak truth to power rather than power to truth will prevail.' 
Wilcomb Washburn was also a U.S. Marine, serving in both World War II and Korea. As both a scholar and a soldier, he combined the exacting rigor of the former with the tenacity of the latter to attack, often singlehandedly, the bastions of irrationality. 
We honor his life and mourn his passing.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, though perhaps most Americans outside the world of art will not readily recognize the name of Lawrence Fleischman, they will know his legacy. Before he died last week at 71, his extraordinary contribution to the Nation's major museums ensured that his name will live on, along with the magnificent artistic treasures he and his family so generously donated. 
As an art dealer, he was, by any measure, a success. But his refreshingly modest attitude toward the worldly goods he accumulated bears repeating. Many of these were priceless antiquities from ancient Greece, Rome, and Etruria. If I may quote from the New York Times obituary: 
`No one owns a work of art,' he said. `You're the custodian of it for the future. You take care of it, you have the pleasure of living with it, and then you pass it on. It is our hope that we leave it to the public.' 
Here in Washington, he helped establish the Archives of American Art, a wonderful research resource of the Smithsonian Institution. In New York, the Lawrence A. and Barbara Fleischman Gallery of American Art will stand as long as the Metropolitan Museum stands, as well as the three other galleries the couple so thoughtfully supported. He has also promised the New York Public Library a substantial gift. 
In short, Lawrence Fleischman was a philanthropist, a word with a distinctly archaic ring to it. But in an age of private wealth and public stringency, it is a word we need to hear much more often.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we now have a consensus that the year 2000 is going to arrive before the Federal Government has prepared its computers for the date. 
Yesterday, in a hearing held by my esteemed colleague Representative Stephen Horn, officials from the General Accounting Office [GAO] warned that many of the Government's computers will stop working in 2000 because agencies have failed to take the appropriate precautions. Joel Willemsen, GAO's Director of Information Resources Management, warned: `There is a high probability there will be some failures.' 
Though widely pronounced in small circles for a year now, this fact is now being heralded by the General Accounting Office--Congress' dutiful investigative arm. To its credit GAO has added the year 2000 problem to its list of `High Risk Government Programs;' promised to report periodically on the status of the agencies' responses; asked agencies to focus on their most critical computer systems; and now, has warned that we must be prepared for some amount of failure. 
Are we ready for failure? In Medicare payments? In our air traffic control system? In our national defense system? We must act, and place responsibility in a body to ensure compliance. My bill, S. 22, would set up a commission to do just that. I can only hope that my colleagues and the leaders of the executive agencies take heed of GAO's warnings of probable failure.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that makes a small but significant change in the hospital mortgage program and the nursing home mortgage program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Section 242 Program, as it is known, enables HUD to guarantee to private lenders that they will not lose money on a construction loan to a hospital. If the hospital cannot make its payments, HUD will assume the mortgage. The program insures loans for renovation, modernization, and new construction, and also covers the refinancing of existing mortgages. The Section 232 program does the same for nursing home projects. 
In August, 1995 the portfolio included 100 projects in 18 States. It is particularly important in New York where State regulations require hospitals to secure such insurance and where construction costs are high. Further, because New York is deregulating its hospitals, in the next few years the hospitals need as much flexibility as possible, including the ability to refinance existing debt. The program will be more important than ever. 
Ensuring hospital mortgages may seem to be a risky venture, but this program is successful. Since 1969 it has made a net contribution to the government of $221 million through fees it charges the hospitals, and in only three years has it had a negative net cash flow. The most recent was 1991. 
The bill I am offering today would strengthen the program by giving HUD partial payment of claims authority. Currently, if a 
hospital or nursing home cannot make a mortgage payment, HUD must assume the entire mortgage at considerable cost and administrative effort. Partial payment of claims would prevent this. If, for example, a hospital owes a $10 million payment and only has $6 million available, HUD would simply provide the $4 million shortfall. There would be no requirement nor necessity of assuming the mortgage. 
HUD already has partial payment of claims authority in most of its other mortgage insurance programs, such as the multifamily housing program, and it works well. There is no reason for the Agency not to have this authority in the hospital and the nursing home program, and in fact it makes eminent sense. 
My friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, joins me as a cosponsor of this bill. I ask my other colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, in introducing a bill that would establish a commission to address the long term problems confronting the Medicare Program. 
In 1983, I joined with then-Senator Bob Dole as a member of the Greenspan Commission, which proposed a series of reforms and improvements in the Social Security program. Congress' ability to resolve the complex and controversial issues facing Social Security at that time were in doubt up until the last minute. In the end, it was the bipartisan nature of the Greenspan Commission that allowed Congress to agree on a solution. 
This year, combined tax income to the Medicare and OASDI trust funds has been less than the amount paid out of these trust funds. The trustees of the Federal hospital insurance trust fund, the independent actuaries at the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] and the Congressional Budget Office all agree that the HI trust fund will run out of money in the year 2001. 
Near-term insolvency can be resolved by reducing the rate of growth in the Medicare Program in legislation implementing the federal budget for fiscal year 1998. Yet current proposals do not address the demographic and structural factors that threaten the solvency of the Medicare Program over the longer term. Approaching changes in our Nation's demographics are well known. The so-called `baby boom,' consisting of individuals born between 1946 and 1964, will begin turning 65 in the year 2011. The sheer number of people in this demographic bulge will be overwhelming to the Medicare Program. 
At the same time, the number of people in the generations that follow is significantly smaller, such that by the year 2030 there will be only 2.2 workers for each individual over 65, and thus eligible for Medicare. In 1995 there were 3.9 workers per beneficiary. These demographic changes, combined with projected growth in program costs under its current structure, guarantee an imbalance between the amount of money we will have to pay for the program and the cost of the benefits that it is expected to cover. 
During the recent Presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob Dole, asked if I would sit on a Medicare Commission that he wanted to set up if he were elected President. I responded that I would be happy to serve on any such commission, regardless of which candidate won the White House. In the meantime, President Clinton has also called for a bipartisan process to address the long term difficulties facing Medicare. The President's most recent call for such a process came in his State of the Union Address last week. 
The bipartisan bill we are introducing today will begin this process. We urge our colleagues to join this important effort.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we are now at the height of a contentious debate on whether or not Social Security payments will be made in the 21st century if we pass the balanced budget amendment. The question is moot. 
According to a report released yesterday by the General Accounting Office [GAO], come January 1, 2000, the `Year 2000 Computer Problem' will render all Social Security funds impounded. On the first day of the new millennium thousands of computer systems at the Social Security Administration as well as all the other Federal Agencies--Defense included--could malfunction. 
It is February 13, 1997; we have 1,051 days remaining until January 1, 2000. Not only does the Year 2000 Computer Problem render our balanced budget debate moot, but its extent and impact will have consequences unseen in history. I have introduced a bill, S. 22, that would set up a commission to address the problem. This issue should be the No. 1 priority of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and of the 105th Congress. 
If this matter lingers unaddressed, I can only imagine what else besides Social Security will fail in our computer-dependent society.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague and friend, Senator D'Amato, as a cosponsor of his bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Francis Albert Sinatra. Frank Sinatra is one of the most famous singers in the history of popular music. He is known as `The Voice,' `Old Blue Eyes,' and `The Chairman of the Board.' These nicknames attest as clearly as anything to his talent, his popular appeal, and his impact on American music. 
Mr. Sinatra began his career with local bands in New Jersey. He joined Harry James' band in 1939, but began to achieve his great popularity touring with Tommy Dorsey from 1940 to 1942. His solo career began in 1943 and never ceased. 
After conquering the musical world Mr. Sinatra began a film career that quickly earned him an academy award, in 1953, for his supporting role in `From Here to Eternity.' He went on to appear in some 50 movies. 
Mr. President, New York has no official State song. For six decades now Frank Sinatra has entertained New Yorkers in music and film. His impact has been tremendous. But more than anything else his version of `New York, New York' has given us cheer, enjoyment, and pride. It is certainly the unofficial song for millions. Therefore, I am delighted to cosponsor this bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Frank Sinatra. I encourage my colleagues to join us.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I first take the opportunity to congratulate the chairman for this initiative. It is characteristic of his leadership of the Finance Committee, which is bipartisan whenever that is possible, which is factual, which seeks evidence and answers. 
This sense-of-the-Senate resolution recognizes the mounting evidence that, contrary to the intent of the Congress and the President, Federal tax provisions, Social Security benefits, and other Federal program benefits are being overadjusted for inflation. 
The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that: 
* * * all cost-of-living adjustments required by statute should accurately reflect the best available estimate of changes in the cost of living. 
In its final report issued on December 4, 1996, the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index--the Boskin Commission concluded that: 
While the CPI is the best measure currently available it is not a true cost of living index. . .. 
The Boskin Commission concluded that the CPI overstates the cost of living in the United States by 1.1 percentage points. 
The Commission's findings are very much in line with the prevailing professional judgment of economists as to the size of the upward bias in the CPI. In October 1994, in a memorandum to the President entitled `Big Choices', then-OMB Director Alice Rivlin stated that the `CPI may be overstated by 0.4 percent to 1.5 percent.' And in testimony at a joint hearing of the Senate and House Budget Committees in January 1995--and reinforced in testimony last week before the Senate Committee on Finance--Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, estimated the range of plausible values at 0.5 to 1.5 percentage points. 
The standard objection to correcting the Consumer Price Index has been, to cite one such statement, `The right way to adjust the CPI is to allow the experts at the BLS to continue doing their jobs and keep politics out of it.' 
We now have the definitive response from Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In testimony last week before the Finance Committee, he reported that the Federal Reserve Board had made its own study of this issue and had come to roughly the same conclusions as those of the Boskin Commission. He recommended a two-track procedure. First, let the BLS improve the CPI by as much as can be done and as quickly as it can be done. And second, establish an independent national commission to correct for the remaining upward bias. He then said:  
There has been considerable objection that such a second track procedure would be a political fix. To the contrary, assuming zero for the remaining bias is the political fix. On this issue, we should let evidence, not politics, drive policy. 
To say again, to do nothing in the face of overwhelming evidence would be a political decision. Wrong-headed and shortsighted, with large long-term implications 
And to do nothing until we have a more precise estimate of the bias--as if estimating changes in the cost of living is equivalent to measuring atomic weights--recalls the wise admonition of Lord John Maynard Keynes who said: 
It is better to be approximately right than precisely wrong. 
There is some history here. 
It happens that this Senator's association with the statistical system in the executive branch began over three decades ago. I was Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy and Planning in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. This was a new position in which I was nominally responsible for, inter alia, the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I say nominally out of respect for the independence of that venerable institution, which as I noted earlier long predated the Department of Labor itself. The then-Commissioner of the BLS, Ewan Clague, could not have been more 
friendly and supportive. And so were the statisticians, who undertook to teach me to the extent I was teachable. They even shared professional confidences. And so it was that I came to have some familiarity with the field. 
Upon our arrival in Washington with the new administration in 1961, we had waiting for us a report on price indexes from a committee led by George J. Stigler, who later won a Nobel Prize in economics. The committee noted that: 
If a poll were taken of professional economists and statisticians, in all probability they would designate (and by a wide majority) the failure of the price indexes to take full account of quality changes as the most important defect in these indexes. And by almost as large a majority, they would believe that this failure introduces a systematic upward bias in the price indexes--that quality changes have on average been quality improvements. 
Through indexation of Federal tax brackets, Social Security, and other Federal programs, Congress and the President have undertaken to protect taxpayers and beneficiaries from the erosion of purchasing power due to inflation. 
Based on over 35 years of mounting evidence, it is clear that the current formulas for indexation overstate the true cost of living. Over 12 years the upward bias increases outlays and reduces revenues, for programs tied to the CPI, by a cumulative $1.07 trillion. 
The actuaries of the Social Security system estimate that a 1.1 percentage point correction would eliminate about two-thirds of the long-run deficit in the Social Security Program. The trust fund exhaustion date would be extended by more than 20 years, from 2029 to 2052. 
Somewhat more than one-half of the 1.1 percentage bias can be eliminated rather quickly if the BLS would develop a cost-of-living index [COLI] and factor into their calculations research on quality improvements. Members of the Boskin Commission think it can be done within a year. Over time, some of the remainder of the bias could be reduced by further research on measuring quality improvements. Any residual can be dealt with by an independent national commission, as suggested by the Boskin Commission and by Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan. 
The computational procedures that would be used by BLS for a new cost of living index [COLI] are now used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA] in the calculations of GDP and its components--consumption, investment, and so on. BEA uses a Personal Consumption Expenditures [PCE] deflator to estimate changes in real consumption. For the 12 months ended November 1996, the CPI increased by 3.3 percent. Yet over roughly the same period, the PCE deflator increased by only 2.5 percent. BEA's use, in the PCE deflator, of more up-to-date consumption patterns and of adjustments for quality, lowers the reported inflation rate by 0.8 of a percentage point relative to the CPI. And this is consistent with what you would get if BLS developed a COLI with adjustments for quality improvements; that is, it is close to the 1.1 percentage point estimate of the bias. 
I hope we will have broad support for this resolution on both sides of the aisle, and that we will do the Republic some good today. Mr. President, thank you for your courtesy. I yield the floor.

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, while people in Washington and around the country celebrated the Presidential inauguration this past weekend, people in New York State observed the 1-year anniversary of an event of a very different kind--one of the worst natural disasters we have ever faced. In New York, especially upstate New York, January 19, 1996, will forever be known as the day the waters came. 
A combination of severe thunderstorms and melting snow led to one of the worst floods in our State's history. Forty-one of the State's 62 counties were declared disaster areas. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, damages were greater than $100 million. My home county, Delaware, was the hardest hit; bridges were washed away, homes were ruined, roads were destroyed, fields were inundated, and entire villages were left under water. Six of the eleven fatalities caused by the flood were in Delaware County. 
Over the past year, the people of New York have tried to rebuild their homes and their lives. Our towns, villages, and counties have tried to rebuild their roads and municipal facilities. FEMA and the State Emergency Management Office, or SEMO, have been there to help, but it has not been easy. The flood of January 19 was not the only one of the year. It came just 2 weeks after the great blizzard of 1996. Then in October, the New York City area was hit by a severe flood, and only a month later, large parts of upstate New York were flooded again. Although not as severe as the January floods, heavy rains again caused damages in several areas of the State, especially Clinton and Essex Counties in the northeast corner, and once again, Delaware County was hit. 
Ask any local official in upstate New York what they will remember most about 1996 and invariably he or she will say the floods. We have spent the last year trying to recover and rebuild, and I thank FEMA Director James Lee Witt and Regional Director Lynn Canton and SEMO Director Ed Jacoby for all their help. We have made a lot of progress but, as Delaware County Board of Supervisor's Chairman Ray Christensen will often tell you, `We have to realize things will never be the same.'

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, January 22, 1997, I introduced S. 112, the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1997. One day after its introduction, the Law Enforcement Steering Committee--a committee of 10 police associations, representing 500,000 law enforcement officers nationwide--wrote me to endorse this bill in the strongest terms. 
This legislation will require the Treasury Department to work with the Justice Department in order to develop uniform ballistics standards for testing the capability of ammunition to pierce police body armor. This bill will, I hope, mark my final step in a 15-year journey to ban all cop-killer bullets in America. In 1986 and 1994, Congress recognized the importance of this issue, and we passed bills that established a content-based ban on this type of ammunition. But, until we ban these bullets based on performance, rather than on their physical characteristics, policemen everywhere will remain in extreme peril. 
As the Law Enforcement Steering Committee wrote in their letter to me, `This is an issue of life-or-death importance to every law enforcement officer in America.' I have faith that my colleagues will once again recognize the crucial nature of this issue and enact S. 112 early in the 105th Congress.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Chafee, in introducing this legislation to extend permanently the full, fair market value deduction for gifts of publicly traded stock to private foundations. 
Much of the focus in Congress over the last several years has been on efforts to control or reduce Government spending in order to balance the budget. As programs are cut to meet budget constraints, pressure will be placed on other sectors, particularly the independent sector, to fill the void. Already, the extent to which nonprofit institutions in the United States perform functions that are typically governmental undertakings in other countries is perhaps not fully understood or appreciated. It is a unique feature of our society of inestimable value and must be sustained. As demand on the independent sector grows, we must support its efforts to promote the common good and confront social problems. 
A bit of history: prior to 1969, contributions of appreciated property were deductible at their fair market value. In 1969, Congress adopted a number of rules to address certain abuses then occurring with respect to a small number of private foundations. These included a series of targeted Treasury Department recommendations to impose excise tax penalties on self-dealing transactions, excess business holdings, insufficient distributions for charitable purposes, and the like. However, in response to the negative publicity surrounding private foundations at the time, Congress felt it necessary to impose other restrictions beyond the targeted Treasury proposals. These included a provision to limit the deduction for gifts of appreciated property to private foundations to the donor's basis, usually, the original purchase price. 
After 1969, the IRS and other experts concluded that the targeted antiabuse rules worked well to correct the problems with private foundations. And nothing indicated that the 1969 limit on deductibility of gifts of appreciated property to private foundations was necessary to prevent abuse, at least to the extent that the property's value was readily determinable. Thus, in 1984, Congress approved a rule, that sunset after 10 years, providing a deduction for the full value of gifts of publicly traded stock to private foundations. This temporarily restored parity of treatment to contributions of stock to public charities--already fully deductible--and to private foundations. 
Then came the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which was largely an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce rates. One such base-broadening provision was the creation of a tax preference under the individual alternative minimum tax [AMT] for gifts of appreciated property to charitable organizations. Thus, taxpayers subject to the AMT could only deduct the basis of property donated to charitable organizations. 
As it turned out, the 1986 Tax Act worked all too well. Not only was the base broadened, but charitable giving of appreciated property nearly disappeared. And the charitable organizations let us know that our action had hurt them financially in such a way that not only they, but the larger public trust they serve, were suffering. Thus, at the behest of this Senator, in 1990 Congress at first temporarily, and then in 1993 permanently, repealed the tax preference for contributions of appreciated property. 
At the end of 1994, however, the full deduction for contributions of appreciated stock to private foundations expired. It had been intended as a 10-year experiment; the 10 years ran out, and the experiment was over. But most observers concluded that the experiment had worked--the private foundation rules continued to work reasonably well to prevent abuse, even while gifts of appreciated stock were fully deductible. In particular, the rule was not a source of compliance problems for the Internal Revenue Service. Thus, we agreed to extend the provision temporarily just last year in the Small Business Job Protection Act. Unfortunately, it will expire once again at the end of May. There being no harm done by this provision, and much good, it is a rule we should like to see extended once again--and this time permanently. 
Mr. President, no reason exists to provide different treatment under the Tax Code for gifts of appreciated stock to private foundations than is provided for such gifts to public charities. Private foundations are an important component of our nonprofit, independent sector. They make vast contributions to our society in the areas of education, health, disaster relief, the advancement of knowledge and the preservation of historical and cultural artifacts, to name only a few. Government must play a role in ensuring that nonprofit institutions not merely survive, but thrive--particularly during an era of Government cutbacks. The legislation we introduce today will be a great help in this regard. I look forward to its early and favorable consideration in the 105th Congress.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the nomination of Madeleine K. Albright to be Secretary of State. We stand at the end of a century of European conflict: two world wars followed by a cold war. In the wake of this hundred years' war it is hugely important that the President has nominated a woman, born in Europe amidst this turmoil, to be his Secretary of State to lead us into the next century. 
The first point I would like to make, a point that deserves to be stressed by every Senator, is that when Ambassador Albright is confirmed, she will become the 64th Secretary of State, and the first woman ever to hold that office. No woman has ever held a higher office in the executive branch. I congratulate both the President and his distinguished nominee on this milestone. 
Ambassador Albright came to the United States at the age of 11, having experienced herself the realities of this hundred years' war. Most recently she comes to us from Turtle Bay, NY, where she has served as our Permanent Representative to the United Nations. As the only Ambassador-Senator, and having served in the same post at the United Nations, I feel it incumbent upon me to inform my colleagues that for her to have endured 4 years of mind-numbing addresses at the United Nations is no small feat. 
As Ambassador, she has earned the respect of many. Not the least of which are the editors of the New Republic who wrote in a December 30, 1996, editorial: 
The good news about Albright, in sum, is that she is a creature of the twentieth century. For this reason, she understands how appallingly similar to this century the next century is likely to be. A person whose primal scene was Nazism and then Stalinism is not likely to get drunk on talk of a new millennium. She is likely to know, rather, that evil is never permanently retired, and certainly not by technological change. Albright recognized early that the most pressing order of business for Clinton's foreign policy in its first term was not protectionism, it was genocide. And a person whose primal scene was not Vietnam will know that there is only one way to stop genocide, and this is the harsh, airborne way. 
As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we find ourselves at the end of a century of conflict. We began the century trying to stay out of the affairs of Europe. That lasted only through Wilson's first term. Now we end the century having played a pivotal role in the events which shaped it. This is an occasion on which we recall the great hopes that Franklin D. Roosevelt had for the United Nations. We can now use the fruit of our century-long labors, most importantly the United Nations Charter, to realize the hopes of Roosevelt, Truman, Marshall, and Acheson. 
Nowhere is the importance of the Charter more pronounced than in Bosnia. I have spoken in this chamber many times on the subject of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Had we invoked the charter early in the conflict and its provision for demonstrations under article 42, by `air, sea, or land forces, [to] restore international peace and security,' much of the genocide that followed could have been prevented. We had the tools, but waited too long to use them. 
The Bosnian conflict is far from over. Though the Dayton agreement and NATO forces have achieved relative stability over the past 13 months, there are still many important issues to be resolved. 
None is more important, or pressing, then the work of the International Criminal Tribunal. Today 75 persons have been indicted for war crimes. It is appalling to report that 68 of them remain at large. Not because they cannot be found, but because pressure has not been brought to bear on countries to deliver indicted war criminals to The Hague. 
This is an issue that cannot afford delay. I would ask the Secretary-designate to seek to address this important problem at the earliest possible date. She has made such a pledge during her testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee and I look forward to working with her to achieve these goals. 
I say this with the deepest respect for Ambassador Albright, who, having spent 4 years at the United Nations, is keenly aware of the importance of these issues. I wish her well on her historic appointment.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to reintroduce legislation that would establish a medical education trust fund to support America's 142 accredited medical schools and 1,250 teaching hospitals. These institutions are national treasures; they are the very best in the world. Yet today they find themselves in a precarious financial situation as market forces reshape the health care delivery system in the United States. Explicit and dedicated funding for these institutions, which this legislation will provide, will ensure that the United States continues to lead the world in the quality of its health care system. 
This legislation requires that the public sector, through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector, through an assessment on health insurance premiums, contribute broad-based and fair financial support.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 1,074 days. Rather, one thousand seventy-four days and counting. We have 1,074 days until January 1, 2000. Historically, the passage of the century has caused quite a stir. Until now, however, there has been little factual basis on which doomsayers and apocalyptic fearmongers could spread their gospel. I rise today, on the first day of legislative business in the 105th Congress, to warn that we have cause for fear. 
In the 6th century AD, the Western world began the practice of numbering years consecutively. The 6th-century monk, Dionysius Exiguus (known as `Denis the Small'), introduced the first consecutive year calendar. Popular mythology would have us believe that at the end of the first millennium, Christians and pagans everywhere were cowering in fear of the end of the world. Yet, current historians believe that at the end of the year 999, much of the populace had no idea what year it was, and thus no idea that the millennium was coming to a close. In an ironic twist of fate, many calendars in our current, most advanced technological society ever may be as inaccurate as those of the people who faced the beginning of the Second Millennia A.D. 
I have no proof that the Sun is about to rise on the apocalyptic millennium of which chapter 20 of the Book of Revelation speaks, nor do I have proof that, armed with flood and catastrophe, the Four Horseman will arrive on January 1, 2000. I do know, however, that a seemingly innocuous `computer glitch' relating to how computers use the date could wreak worldwide havoc. This lack of recognition on the part of computers--called the year 2000 Computer Problem, or `Y2K' as computer aficionados call it--could cause everything from the failure of weapons systems, widespread disruption of business operations, the miscalculation of taxes by the Internal Revenue Service, possible misdiagnosis or improper medical treatment due to errors in medical records, to incorrect traffic signals at street corners across the country. 
In the 1950's and 1960's, computer programmers decided that, in order to minimize the consumption of computer memory, most computer languages would be designed to express the date with only six digits. In this format, the date of this speech would be 97-01-21. The century designation `19' is assumed. The problem is that many programs will read January 1, 2000 as January 1, 1900. Millions of computer programs will not function correctly because they cannot recognize the 21st century. The answer to this problem is a costly, time-consuming process of rewriting the computer codes. 
Estimates to fix the problem in the United States alone are in the range of $300 billion ($600 billion worldwide). That's billion with a `B'. Experts have estimated that about half the cost of upgrading U.S. computers will have to be paid by 
Government entities. Furthermore, the cost of fixing the `Y2K' problem will increase at 20-50 percent per year due to the decreasing supply of, and increasing demand for, the skilled professionals who can rewrite the codes. 
There is no time to cower at the immensity and pervasiveness of the problem, even though it is true that at our current rate of addressing this problem, millions of computer programs across the globe will not recognize the year 2000. We have developed the medicine to cure the disease. It is our job to recognize the extent of our ills and the time-consuming nature of the cure. 
I now enter my second year warning of this problem. People have begun to listen. But neither the public nor private sector is anywhere near where they need to be. I congratulate my counterparts in the other Chamber of Congress, namely Representative Stephen Horn, Representative Carolyn Maloney, Representative Connie Morella, and Representative John Tanner, who have held hearings on this matter and helped uncover the Federal Government's lack of preparation for this crisis. The administration has only begun to stir. 
In his November 25, 1996 letter (answering my July 31st letter to the President) Franklin Raines, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, stated that:  
We have been meeting with senior agency officials and urging them to complete their assessments of the scope of the problem now, so they will have time to fix it. We have assurances that all of their systems will either be fixed, replaced, or scrapped before 2000, and we will continue to monitor their progress. As we develop the President's 1998 budget, we are working with the agencies to assure that there is adequate funding to support agency year 2000 activities. 
Mr. Raines paints a much more comfortable picture than was revealed in the Congressional findings of just 2 months prior. In September 1996, the House Committee on Government Oversight reported that: only 9 of the 24 departments and agencies (which the Committee had just queried) had a plan for addressing the problem; five had not even designated an official within the organization to be responsible for the problem; and 17 of the departments and agencies lacked any cost estimates for the problem. I am encouraged that Representative Stephen Horn (R-CA) will continue his subcommittee's oversight hearings on February 24, 1997. 
Yet, someone or something needs to ensure that the Federal Government, State governments, and all sectors of the economy are `Year 2000 Compliant.' The OMB has neither the staff nor the resources to do this alone. I am introducing today a revamped bill that will set up a Commission to address this problem. 
Commissions are not by definition weak. This commission will 
assume responsibility for assuring that all Federal agencies are Year 2000 compliant by January 1, 1999 ( a year early, so as to leave enough time for testing--some say the longest part). The Commission will be composed of experts on the Federal response and the State response in order to face the problems of integration. The Commission will prioritize which agencies are most at risk of not performing vital functions, and through its reports to the President and Congress, it will recommend the appropriate triage process and medicine. It it not enough to recognize that this problem exists. Unless we install the doctors for the triage, the Y2K disease will manifest itself in all sectors of government and the economy. 
We are told that the President will include adequate funding for the Executive Agencies in his budget plan for fiscal year 1998. My hope is that Congress will recognize the importance of providing the funding now; for if we wait, not only will the costs rise, but we are liable to see major Government agencies and State governments unable to perform critical functions. 
It is January 21 of 1997; we have 1,074 days remaining until January 1, 2000. Too late to lament, time to act. 
In the first stanza of his epic work, `The Second Coming,' Yeats wrote of the onslaught of the apocalypse: 
Turning and turning in the widening gyre 
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; 
Things fall apart; the center cannot hold; 
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, 
The blood dimmed tide is loosed . . . 
At the upcoming turn of the millennium, we cannot test what `blood dimmed tide' computer malfunctions could loose on our society.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Curt Flood Act of 1997, a bill drafted by the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. 
This bill is designed to be a partial repeal of major league baseball's antitrust exemption. It would leave the exemption in place as it pertains to minor league baseball and the ability of major league baseball to control the relocation of franchises. 
In 1922, the Supreme Court of the United States, in Federal Baseball Club v. National League, held that `exhibitions of base ball' were not interstate commerce and thus were exempt from the antitrust laws. Fifty years later, in Flood v. Kuhn in 1972, the Court concluded that the antitrust exemption was an `anomaly' and an `aberration confined to baseball' and that `profession baseball is a business and it is engaged in interstate commerce.' Even so, the Court refused to reverse its 1922 decision in Federal Baseball. Justice Blackmun, delivering the opinion of the Court in Food, wrote: 
If there is any inconsistency or illogic in all this, it is an inconsistency and illogic of long standing that is to be remedied by the Congress and not by this Court. 
This decision clearly laid responsibility for baseball's antitrust exemption on Congress. It also explicitly recognized baseball's evolution into a major industry. Clearly, baseball is a business engaged in interstate commerce, and should be subject to the antitrust laws to the same extent that all other businesses are. So now, in 1997, on the 75th anniversary of Federal Baseball, the time has come for Congress to act. 
On the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced my own legislation on the subject. My bill, S. 15, the National Pastime Preservation Act of 1995, would have applied the antitrust laws to major league baseball without the exceptions suggested by my friend from Utah. 
At this time, I am pleased to support any efforts that will provide a more level playing field for baseball's labor negotiations and that should help to prevent future strikes like the one we experienced in 1994 and 1995 from interrupting the fans enjoyment of the game of baseball itself. While I am happy that both the owners and the players agreed to support this limited repeal of baseball's antitrust exemption, it is important to keep in mind that the players and owners do not write the labor laws, Congress does. 
It is most appropriate that this bill has been named in honor of Curt Flood, the man responsible for the second significant challenge to baseball's antitrust immunity. Curt Flood was a battler. Sadly, he lost a different battle yesterday, to throat cancer. He was only 59. 
Mr. Flood hit over .300 six times playing for the St. Louis Cardinals and he finished his 15-year career with a lifetime batting average of .293. he was also a seven-time Gold Glove winner, a three-time all-star, and he helped lead the cardinals to their World Series titles in 1964 and 1967. 
After the 1969 season, however, at the age of 32, Curt Flood was traded to the Phillies. Mr. Flood did not want to move. St. Louis was his home (he had played for the Cardinals for 11 years) and he was concerned about the racial politics in Philadelphia at the time. He sent a letter to Commissioner Bowie Kuhn asking him to nullify the trade, but his request was denied. It was in response to this denial that Mr. Flood initiated his historic suit challenging baseball's antitrust exemption. 
Curt Flood put his career on the line by sitting out the 1970 season as he challenged baseballs' reserve clause--rules that prohibited players from choosing which teams they wished to play for. While he resumed playing in 1971 after St. Louis and Philadelphia made a deal with the Washington Senators, the year off hurt Mr. Flood. his level of play was not the same and he retired after playing only 13 games for the Senators. The head of the players' union, Don Fehr, called Mr. Flood `a man of quiet dignity.' He added, `Curt Flood conducted his life in a way that set an example for all who had the privilege to know him. When it came time to take a stand, at great personal risk and sacrifice, he proudly stood firm for what he believe was right.' 
I thank my friend from Utah for inviting me to cosponsor this legislation, and hope other Senators agree with us that the time has come to act.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce this bill to repeal an unprecedented provision--unprecedented until the 104th Congress--to tamper with the constitutional protection of habeas corpus. 
The provision reads:

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to amend Title 18 of the United States Code to strengthen the existing prohibition on handgun ammunition capable of penetrating policy body armor, commonly referred to as bullet-proof vests. This provision would require the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to develop a uniform ballistics test to determine with precision whether ammunition is capable of penetrating police body armor. The bill also prohibits the manufacture and sale of any handgun ammunition determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to have armor-piercing capability. 
I am encouraged that, on behalf of its 277,000 members, the Fraternal Order of Police has decided to support this bill. In addition the Law Enforcement Steering Committee, which represents eight of the largest Associations of law enforcement officers, has also indicated that they are in support of this bill. 
I am also pleased that President Clinton has taken an avid interest in this subject. In a statement similar to remarks he made many times at campaign appearances around the country, President Clinton said to an audience in Cincinnati, Ohio on September 16, 1996: 
So that's my program for the future--do more to break the gangs, ban those cop killer bullets, drug testing for parolees, improve the opportunities for community-based strategies that lower crime and give our kids something to say yes to. 
Mr. President, it has been fifteen years since I first introduced legislation in the Senate to outlaw armor-piercing, or `cop-killer,' bullets. In 1982, Phil Caruso of the Patrolman's Benevolent Association of New York City alerted me to the existence of a Teflon-coated bullet capable of penetrating the soft body armor police officers were then beginning to wear. Shortly thereafter, I introduced the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act of 1982 to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of such ammunition. 
At that time, armor-piercing bullets--most notably the infamous `Green Hornet'--were manufactured with a solid steel core. Unlike the softer lead composition of most other ammunition, this hard steel core prevented these rounds from deforming at the point of impact--thus permitting the rounds to penetrate the 18 layers of Kevlar in a standard-issue police vest or `flak-jacket.' These bullets could go through a bullet-proof vest like a hot knife through butter. My legislation simply 
banned any handgun ammunition made with a core of steel or other hard metals. 
Despite the strong support of the law enforcement community, it took four years before this seemingly non-controversial legislation was enacted into law. The National Rifle Association initially opposed it--that is, until the NRA realized that a large number of its members were themselves police officers who strongly supported banning these insidious bullets. Only then did the NRA lend its grudging support. The bill passed the Senate on March 6, 1986 by a vote of 97-1, and was signed by President Reagan on August 8, 1986 (Public Law 99-408). 
That 1986 Act served us in good stead for 7 years. To the best of my knowledge, not a single law enforcement officer was shot with an armor-piercing bullet. Unfortunately, the ammunition manufacturers eventually found a way around the 1986 law. By 1993, a new Swedish-made armor-piercing round, the M39B, had appeared. This pernicious bullet evaded the 1986 statute's prohibition because of its unique composition. Like most common ammunition, it had a soft lead core, thus exempting it from the 1986 law. But this core was surrounded by a heavy steel jacket, solid enough to allow the bullet to penetrate body armor. Once again, our nation's law enforcement officers were at risk. Immediately upon learning of the existence of the new Swedish round, I introduced a bill to ban it. 
Another protracted series of negotiations ensued before we were able to update the 1986 statute to cover the M39B. We did it with the support of law enforcement organizations, and with technical assistance from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In particular, James O. Pasco, Jr., then the Assistant Director of Congressional Affairs at BATF, worked closely with me and may staff to get it done. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent on November 19, 1993 as an amendment to the 1994 Crime Bill. 
Despite these legislative successes, it was becoming evident that continuing `innovations' in bullet design would result in new armor-piercing rounds capable of evading the ban. It was at this time that some of us began to explore in earnest the idea of developing a new approach to banning these bullets based on their performance, rather than their physical characteristics. Mind, this concept was not entirely new; the idea had been discussed during our efforts in 1986, but the NRA had been immovable on the subject. The NRA's leaders, and their constituent ammunition manufacturers, felt that any such broad-based ban based on a bullet `performance standard' would inevitably lead to the outlawing of additional classes of ammunition. They viewed it as a slippery slope, much as they have regarded the assault weapons ban as a slippery slope. The NRA had agreed to the 1986 and 1993 laws only because they were narrowly drawn to cover individual types of bullets. 
And so in 1993 I asked the ATF for the technical assistance necessary to write into law an armor-piercing bullet `performance standard.' At the time, however, the experts at the ATF informed us that this could not be done. They argued that it was simply too difficult to control for the many variables that contribute to a bullet's capability to penetrate police body armor. We were told that it might be possible in the future to develop a performance-based test for armor-piercing capability, but at the time we had to be content with the existing content-based approach. 
Well. Two years passed and the Office of Law Enforcement Standards of the National Institute of Standards and Technology wrote a report describing the methodology for just such a armor-piercing bullet performance test. The report concluded that a test to determine armor-piercing capability could be developed within six months. 
So we know it can be done, if only the agencies responsible for enforcing the relevant laws have the will. The legislation I am introducing requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General, to establish performance standards for the uniform testing of handgun ammunition. Such an objective standard will ensure that no rounds capable of penetrating police body armor, regardless of their composition, will ever be available to those who would use them against our law enforcement officers. 
I wish to assure the Senate that this measure would in no way infringe upon the rights of legitimate hunters and sportsmen. It would not affect legitimate sporting ammunition used in rifles. It would only restrict the availability of armor-piercing rounds, for which no one can seriously claim there is a genuine sporting use. These cop-killer rounds have no legitimate uses, and they have no business being in the arsenals of criminals. They are designed for one purpose: to kill police officers. 
The 1986 and 1993 cop-killer bullet laws I sponsored kept us one step ahead of the designers of new armor-piercing rounds. When the legislation I have introduced today is enacted--and I hope it will be early in the 105th Congress--it will put them out of the cop-killer bullet business permanently.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two tax bills which I introduced together for the first time last summer. The two bills are both significant in their own rights. Yet, when taken together, they correct a serious misallocation of our limited resources under present law: a tax subsidy that inures largely to the benefit of wealthy sports franchise owners and their players would be replaced with increased for higher education and research. 
The first bill, the Higher Education Bond Parity Act of 1997, has been introduced several times previously by this Senator, with several of my distinguished colleagues as cosponsors. It would undo what ought never have been done. It would remove the `private activity' label from the tax-exempt bonds of private, nonprofits higher education institutions and other organizations, and thereby eliminate the arbitrary $150 million cap on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that such as institution may have outstanding. 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed the `private activity' label (and a $150 million cap) on bonds issued on behalf on nonprofit institutions, collectively known as section 501(c)(3) organizations. This was a serious error. The cap has relegated private, higher education institutions to a diminished, restricted status, relative to their public counterparts. 
Already, this has caused observable, harmful effects on many of our Nation's leading colleges and universities. Thirty-four of them presently are at or near the $150 million cap, and unlike their public counterparts are precluded from using tax-exempt to finance classrooms, libraries, research laboratories, and the like. A few years ago, as the $150 million cap was bargaining to take effect, 19 of the universities that ranked in the top 50 in research undertaking were private institutions. Today, only 14 of those 19 private institutions remain in the top 50, and all but one are foreclosed form tax-exempt financing as a result of the $150 million per institution limit. 
We must act soon to restore the access of private colleges and universities to tax-exempt financing equal to that of their pubic counterparts. Otherwise, the vitality of our private institutions in higher education and research will be at risk. And we will lose a distinguishing feature of American society of inestimable value--the singular degree to which we maintain an independent sector--`private universit[ies] in the public service,' to paraphrase the motto of New York University. This is no longer so in most of the democratic world; it never was so in the rest. It is a treasure and a phenomenon that has clearly produced excellence--indeed, the envy of the world--and it must be sustained. 
The practical effect of the $150 million cap is to deny tax-exempt financing to large, private, research-oriented educational institutions most in need of capital to carry out their research mission. This will have a predictable impact over a generation: the distribution of major research in this country will inevitably shift to public institutions. If I may use California as an example, we could look up one day and find Stanford to be still an institution of the greatest quality as an undergraduate teaching facility--with a fine law 
school and excellent liberal arts degree program--but with all the big science projects at Berkeley, the State institution. 
By removing the `private activity' label, this legislation will restore the parity of treatment of private nonprofit institutions and their public counterparts, and reinstate proper recognition in the tax code of the essential public purposes served by such private institutions. 
The capital needs of private colleges and universities merit the close attention of this body. The cost of these changes is modest, given their importance. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the revenue loss previously at $308 million over 5 years. The Senate has twice passed legislation to remove the `private activity' label and the $150 million bond cap--in the Family Tax Fairness, Economic Growth, and Health Care Access Act of 1992 (H.R. 4210) and the Revenue Act of 1992 (H.R. 11)--only to have both bills vetoed for other reasons by President Bush. We should correct this error before it is too late. Otherwise, we will soon look up and find that we do not recognize the higher education sector. 
Mr. President, the second tax bill I introduce today--the Stop Tax-exempt Arena Debt Issuance Act (or STADIA for short)--was introduced by this Senator for the first time last summer. Since that time, the bill has attracted the close scrutiny of bond counsel and their clients and has received much attention in the press almost all of which has been favorable. 
Mr. Keith Olbermann, anchor of ESPN's Sportscenter program, even declared that the introduction of the bill was `paramount among all other sports stories' last year. Mr. Olbermann's support for this legislation is so emphatic that he compared its author to Dr. Jonas Salk. Passage of the bill, Mr. Olbermann says, is `the vaccine that * * * could conceivably at least towards the cure, if not cure immediately, almost all the ills of sports.' 
Mr. Olbermann is far too generous to this Senator, but he is right about the importance of this bill, both to sports fans and to taxpayers. This bill closes a big loophole, a loophole that ultimately injures State and local governments and other issuers of tax-exempt bonds, that provides an unintended Federal subsidy (in fact, contravenes Congressional intent), that underwrites bidding wars among cities battling for professional sports franchises, and that contributes to the enrichment of persons who need no Federal assistance whatsoever. 
A decade ago, I was much involved in the drafting of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. A major objective of that legislation was to simplify the Tax Code by eliminating a large number of loopholes that had come to be viewed as unfair because they primarily benefited small groups of taxpayers. One of the loopholes we sought to close in 1986 was one that permitted builders of professional sports facilities to use tax-exempt bonds. Mind, we had nothing against new stadium construction, but we made the judgment that scarce Federal resources could surely be used in ways that would better serve the public good. The increasing proliferation of tax-exempt bonds had driven up interest costs for financing roads, schools, libraries, and other governmental purposes, led to mounting revenue losses to the U.S. Treasury, caused an inefficient allocation of capital, and allowed wealthy taxpayers to shield a growing amount of their investment income from income tax by purchasing tax-exempt bonds. Thus, we expressly forbade use of `private activity' bonds for sports facilities, intending to eliminate tax-exempt financing of these facilities altogether. 
Unfortunately, our effort in 1986 backfired. Team owners, with help from clever tax counsel, soon recognized that the change could work to their advantage. As columnist Neal R. Pierce wrote recently, team owners `were not checkmated for long. They were soon exhibiting the gall to ask mayors to finance their stadiums with [governmental] purpose bonds.' Congress did not anticipate this. After all, by law, governmental bonds used to build stadiums would be tax-exempt only if no more than 10 percent of the debt service is derived from stadium revenue sources. In other words, non-stadium governmental revenues (i.e., tax revenues, lottery proceeds, and the like) must be used to repay the bulk of the debt, freeing team owners to pocket stadium revenues. Who would have thought that local officials, in order to keep or get a team, would capitulate to team owners--granting concessionary stadium leases and committing limited government revenues to repay stadium debt, thereby hindering their own ability to provide schools, roads and other public investments? 
The result has been a stadium construction boom unlike anything we have ever seen. In the last 6 years alone, over $4 billion has been spent on building 30 professional sports stadiums. According to Prof. Robert Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in 
Illinois and a stadium finance expert, that amount could `completely refurbish the physical plants of the nation's public elementary and secondary schools.' An additional $7 billion of stadiums are in the planning stages, and no end is in sight. 
What is driving the demand for new stadiums? Mainly, team owners' bottom lines and rising player salaries. Although our existing stadiums are generally quite serviceable, team owners can generate greater income, increase their franchise values dramatically, and compete for high-priced free agents with new tax-subsidized, single-purpose stadiums equipped with luxury skyboxes, club seats and the like. Thus, using their monopoly power, owners threaten to move, forcing bidding wars among cities. End result: new, tax-subsidized stadiums with fancy amenities and sweetheart lease deals. 
To cite a case in point, Mr. Art Modell recently moved the Cleveland Browns professional football team from Cleveland to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Prior to relocating, Mr. Modell had said, `I am not about to rape the city [of Cleveland] as others in my league have done. You will never hear me say `if I don't get this I'm moving.' You can go to press on that one. I couldn't live with myself if I did that.' Obviously, Mr. Modell changed his mind. And why? An extraordinary stadium deal with the State of Maryland. 
The State of Maryland (and the local sports authority) provided the land on which the stadium is located, issued $87 million in tax-exempt bonds (yielding interest savings of approximately $60 million over a 30 year period as compared to taxable bonds), and contributed $30 million in cash and $64 million in state lottery revenues toward construction of the stadium. Mr. Modell agreed to contribute $24 million toward the project and, in return, receives rent-free use of the stadium (the franchise pays only for the operating and maintenance costs), $65 million in sales of rights to purchase season tickets (so called `personal seat licenses'), all revenues from selling the right to name the stadium luxury suites, premium seats, in-park advertising, and concessions, and 50 percent of all revenues from stadium events other than Ravens' games (with the right to control the booking of those events). 
Financial World reports that the value of the Baltimore Ravens' franchise increased from $165 million in 1992 (i.e., before the move from Cleveland) to an estimated $250 million, after its first season in the new stadium. It's little wonder that Mr. Modell recently stated: `The pride and presence of a professional football team is far more important than 30 libraries, and I say that with all due respect to the learning process.' 
Meanwhile, the City of Cleveland has agreed to construct a new, $225 million stadium to house an expansion football team. When Mr. Modell decided to move his team to Baltimore, the NFL agreed to create a new Cleveland football team with the same name: the Cleveland Browns. Most cities are not as fortunate when a team leaves. 
We are even reaching a point at which stadiums are being abandoned before they have been used for 10 or 15 years. A recent article in Barron's reports that this owner-perceived `economic obsolescence' has doomed even recently-built venues:  
The eight-year-old Miami Arena is facing a future without its two major tenants, the Florida Panthers hockey team and the Miami Heat basketball franchise, because of inadequate seating capacity and a paucity of luxury suites. The Panthers have already cut a deal to move to a new facility that nearby Broward County is building for them at a cost of around $200 million. Plans call for Dade County to build a new $210 million arena before the end of the decade, despite the fact that the move will leave local taxpayers stuck with servicing the debt on two Miami arenas rather than just one. 
How do taxpayers benefit from all this? They don't. Tickets prices go way up--and stay up--after a new stadium opens. So while fans are asked to foot the bills through tax subsides, many no longer can afford the price of admission. A study of Newsday recently found that tickets prices rose by 32 percent in five new baseball stadiums, as compared to a major league average of 8 percent. Not to mention the refreshments and other concessions, which also cost more in the new venues. 
According to Barron's the projects `cater largely to well-heeled fans, meaning the folks who can afford to pay for seats in glassed-in luxury boxes. While the suit-and-cell-phone crowd get all the best seats, the average taxpayer is consigned to `cheap seats' in nosebleed land or, more often, for following his favorite team on television.' 
Nor do these new stadiums provide much, if any, economic benefit to their local communities. Professor Baade studied new stadiums in 30 metropolitan areas. He found no discernible positive impact on economic development in 27 of the areas, and a negative impact in the other 3. 
Any job growth that does result is extremely expensive. The Congressional Research Service [CRS] reports that the new $177 million football stadium for the Baltimore Ravens is expected to cost $127,000 per job created. By contrast, the cost per job generated by Maryland's economic development program is just $6,250. Another recent study in New York found that a proposed $1 billion stadium for the Yankees would cost over $500,000 for every job created. 
Finally, Federal taxpayers receive absolutely no economic benefit for providing this subsidy. As CRS points out, `Almost all stadium spending is spending that would have been made on other activities within the United States, which means that benefits to the nation as a whole are near zero.' After all, these teams will invariably locate somewhere in the United States, it is just a matter of where. And should the Federal taxpayers in the team's current home town be forced to pay for the team's new stadium in the new city? The answer is unmistakably no. 
The STADIA bill would save about $50 million a year now spent to subsidize professional sports stadiums. So I ask you once again this year, should we subsidize the commercial pursuits of wealthy team owners, encourage escalating player salaries, and underwrite bidding wars among cities seeking (or fighting to keep) professional sports teams, or, would our scarce resources be put to better use for public needs, like higher education and research? To my mind, this is not a difficult choice.

<TEXT>
Mr. Moynihan. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, cosponsored by Senator D'Amoto, to revise the formula for determining the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. 
Medicaid services and associated administrative costs are financed jointly by the Federal government and the States. The formula for the Federal share of a State's payments for services, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage [FMAP], was established when Medicaid was created as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965. The Federal share of administrative costs is 50 percent for all States, though higher rates are applicable for specific items. 
The FMAP is an exotic creature, derived from the Hill-Burton Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946, specifically designed to provide a higher Federal matching rate for states with lower per capita income. Rather than comparing per capita income directly, the HILL-BURTON formula is designed to exaggerate the differences between States' per capita income. A Senate colleague once described it to me as the South's revenge for the war between the States. 
The Federal government's share depends upon the square of the ratio of state per capita income to national per capita income. Per capita income is only a proxy but not the only proxy for measuring the States' relative fiscal capacity. In March 1982, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations stated that,  * * * the use of a single index, resident per capita income, to measure fiscal capacity, seriously misrepresents the actual ability of many governments to raise revenue. Because states tax a wide range of economic activities other than the income of their residents, the per capita income measure fails to account for sources of revenue to which income is only related in part. This misrepresentation results in the systematic over and understatement of the ability of many states to raise revenue. In addition, the recent evidence suggests that per capita income has deteriorated as a measure of capacity. 
Sqaring the ratio of state per capita income to national per capita income exaggerates the differences between States with regard to this incomplete proxy. Suppose my income is $1 and your income $2. The difference we have to make up is $1. If we compare squares, the difference we have to make up is $3. 
I proposed a change to the HILL-BURTON formula in June of 1977--at a commencement address at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, New York--to compare square roots. Going back to our example, if we were to compare square roots, the difference would only be 59 cents--better than $3. Nonetheless, the idea has not caught on. 
Current law stipulates that no State may have an FMAP lower than 50 percent or higher than 83 percent. In Fiscal Year 1997, 11 States and the District of Columbia receive the minimum 50 percent FMAP while Mississippi receives the highest FMAP of 77.22 percent. States are responsible for the nonfederal share of Medicaid costs. Meaning that a State with a FMAP of 50 percent puts up 50 percent of the money and the Federal government puts up 50 percent of the money. A State with a FMAP of 80 percent puts up 20 percent of the funds with a Federal match of 80 percent. This inequity has existed for over 50 years. It is time for change. 
The bill I introduce today would change the minimum FMAP from 50 percent to 60 percent. A modest proposal. As I mentioned before, there are 11 States and the District of Columbia which receive 50 percent. An additional 14 States have an FMAP between 50 and 60 percent. All other States get more. 
The Finance Committee passed this measure as part of its Budget Reconciliation Recommendations in 1995 but it never became law. 
This legislation gives high cost States such as New York the flexibility to realize savings without cost to the Federal government. It does not propose to change the amount of Federal funds such States receive. With an FMAP of 50 percent, a State receiving $1000 in Federal funds would be required to match it with $1000. With a 60 percent FMAP, the same State would still receive $1000 in Federal funds but would only be required to put up $667, a one-third reduction in the amount of state money required. 
Allocation formulas are designed to target Federal funds to States according to need. The FMAP does not. The savings realized by a 60 percent minimum would provide some relief for States with low matching rates and would make the FMAP a bit less regressive. Adjusted for the cost-of-living, New York has the fifth highest poverty rate in the nation. Yet it has an FMAP of 50 percent. Arkansas has the 24th highest poverty rate, yet has an FMAP of 73.29. Our current formula is a regressive one that needs repair. 
I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will make permanent the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance under section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code. This bill, which is cosponsored by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Roth, and by Senators Baucus, Boxer, Bryan, Chafee, Craig, D'Amato, Ford, Glenn, Grassley, Hatch, Kennedy, Kerry, Kyl, Leahy, Lieberman, McConnell, Moseley-Braun, Murray, Robb, Rockefeller, Sarbanes, Shelby, Torricelli, Wyden, and Bingaman ensures that employees may receive up to $5,250 annually in tuition reimbursements or similar educational benefits for both undergraduate and graduate education from their employers on a tax-free basis. 
Section 127 is one of the most successful education programs that the Federal Government has ever undertaken. A million persons benefit from this provision every year. And they benefit in the most auspicious of circumstances. An employer recognizes that the worker is capable of doing work at higher levels and skills and says, `Will you go to school and get a degree so we can put you in a higher position than you have now--and with better compensation?' Unlike so many of our job training programs that have depended on the hope that in the after-math of the training there will be a job, here you have a situation where the worker already has a job and the employer agrees that the worker should enlarge his or her situation in a manner that is beneficial to all concerned. 
This is a program that works. Yet, outside the organizations involved, not many people know of this program. It administers itself. It has no bureaucracy--there is no bureau in the Department of Education for employer-provided educational assistance, no titles, no confirmations, no assistant secretaries. There is nothing except individual contracts, employee and employer, with a great value-added. 
Since its inception in 1978, section 127 has enabled millions of workers to advance their education and improve their job skills without incurring additional taxes and a reduction in take-home pay. Without section 127, workers will find that the additional taxes or reduction in take-home pay impose a significant, even prohibitive, financial obstacle to further education. For example, an unmarried clerical worker pursuing a college diploma who has income of $21,000 in 1997 and who receives tuition reimbursement for two semesters of night courses--worth approximately $4,000--would owe additional Federal income and payroll taxes of $866 on this educational assistance. If the worker has children and was receiving the earned income tax credit, the worker would owe additional taxes--including loss of the EITC benefits--of up to $1,708. 
Section 127 makes an important contribution to simplicity in the tax law. Absent section 127, a worker receiving educational benefits from an employer is taxed on the value of the education received, unless the education is directly related to the worker's current job. Permanent reinstatement of section 127 will allow workers to receive employer-provided educational assistance on a tax-free basis, without the need to consult a tax advisor to determine whether the education is directly related to their current job. 
A well-trained and educated work force is a key to our Nation's competitiveness in the global economy of the 21st century. Pressures from international competition and technological change require constant adjustment by our work force. Education and retraining will be necessary to maintain and strengthen American industry's competitive position. Section 127 has an important, perhaps vital, role to play in this regard. It permits employees to adapt and retrain without incurring additional tax liabilities and a reduction in take-home pay. By removing the tax burden from workers seeking education and retraining, section 127 helps to maintain American workers as the most productive in the industrialized and developing world. 
Section 127 has also helped to improve the quality of America's public education system, at a fraction of the cost of direct-aid programs. A survey by the National Education Association a few years ago found that almost half of all American public school systems provide tuition assistance to teachers seeking advanced training and degrees. This has enabled thousands of public school teachers to obtain advanced degrees, augmenting the quality of instruction in our schools. 
Our most recent extension of section 127 last year excluded expenses of pursuing graduate level education for courses beginning after June 30, 1996. This was a serious mistake. Historically, one quarter of the individuals who have used section 127 went to graduate schools. Ask major employer about their training systems, and they will say nothing is more helpful than being able to send a promising young person, or middle management person, to a graduate school to learn a new field that has developed since that person had his education. 
When we eliminate graduate level education from section 127, we impose a tax increase on many citizens who work and go to graduate school at the same time. But not all of them. Only the ones whose education does not directly relate to their current jobs. For these unlucky persons, we have erected a barrier to their upward mobility. Who are these people? The engineer seeking a masters degree in geology to enter the field of environmental science. The bank teller seeking an MBA in finance or an MPA in accounting. The production line worker seeking an MBA in management. 
Simple equity among taxpayers demands that section 127 be made permanent. Contrast each of the above examples with the following: The environmental geologist seeking a masters in geology, the bank accountant seeking an MPA, and the management trainee seeking an MBA each qualify for tax-free education. There is no justification for this difference in tax treatment. 
Thus, section 127 removes a tax bias against lesser-skilled workers. The tax bias arises because lesser-skilled workers have narrower job descriptions, and a correspondingly greater difficulty proving that educational expenses directly relate to their current jobs. Less-skilled workers are in greater need of remedial and basic education. And they are the ones least able to afford the imposition of tax on their educational benefits. 
It is important to note that employer-provided educational assistance is not an extravagant benefit for highly paid executives. It largely benefits low- and moderate-income employees seeking access to higher education and further job training. A study published by the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in December, 1995 found that 85 percent of section 127 recipients in the 1992-93 academic year earned less than $50,000, with the average recipient earning less than $33,000. An earlier Coopers & Lybrand study indicated that over 70 percent of recipients of section 127 benefits in 1986 were earning less than $30,000, and that participation rates decline as salary levels increase. 
I hope that Congress will recognize the importance of this provision, and enact it permanently. Our on-again, off-again approach to section 127 creates great practical difficulties for the intended beneficiaries. Workers cannot plan sensibly for their educational goals, not knowing the extent to which accepting educational assistance may reduce their take-home pay. As for employers, the fits and starts of the legislative history of section 127 have been a serious administrative nuisance: there have been 8 retroactive extensions of this provision since 1978. If section 127 is in force, then there is no need to withhold taxes on educational benefits provided; if not, the job-relatedness of the educational assistance must be ascertained, a value assigned, and withholding adjusted accordingly. Uncertainty about the program's continuance magnifies this burden, and discourages employers from providing educational benefits. 
For example, section 127 expired for a time after 1994. During 1995, employers did not know whether to withhold taxes or curtail their educational assistance programs. Workers did not know whether they would face large tax bills, and possible penalties and interest, and thus faced considerable risk in planning for their education. Some of my constituents who called my office reported that they were taking fewer courses--or no courses--due to this uncertainty. And when we failed to extend the provision by the end of 1995, employers had to guess as to how to report their worker's incomes on the W-2 tax statements, and employees had to guess whether to pay tax on the benefits they received. In the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 enacted last August, we finally extended the provision retroactively to the beginning of 1995. As a result, we had to instruct the IRS to expeditiously issue guidance to employers and workers on how to obtain refunds. 
The provision expires after June 30, 1997. Will we subject our constituents, once again, to similar confusion? The legislation I introduce today would restore certainty to section 127 by extending it retroactively--from July 1, 1996--for graduate level education, and maintaining it on a permanent basis for all education. 
Thomas Jefferson, as ever, was right to observe that American liberty depends on an educated electorate. In 1816, the year in which the Senate Committee on Finance was founded, Jefferson warned `If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.' 
Previous efforts to extend this provision have enjoyed broad and bipartisan support. Encouraging workers to further their education and to improve their job skills is an important national priority. It is crucial for preserving our competitive position in the global economy. Permitting employees to receive educational assistance on a tax-free basis, without incurring significant cuts in take-home pay, is a demonstrated, cost-effective means for achieving these objectives. This is a wonderful piece of unobtrusive social policy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Poverty Data Correction Act of 1997, a bill to require that any data relating to the incidence of poverty in subnational areas be corrected for the differences in the cost of living in those areas. This legislation, cosponsored by Senators Lieberman and Jeffords, would correct a longstanding inequity and would provide us with more accurate information on the number of Americans living in poverty. 
Mr. President, residents of New York and Connecticut earn more than do the residents of Mississippi or Alabama. But they also must spend more. The 1990 Census of Population and Housing, for instance, determined that homeowner costs with a mortgage averaged $1,096 per month in Connecticut, $894 in New York State--not city, $555 in Alabama, and $511 in Mississippi. The national average was $737. 
Yet, we have a national poverty threshold adjusted only by family size and composition, not by where the family lives. A family of four just above the poverty threshold in New York City is demonstrably worse off than a family of four just below the threshold in, say, rural Arkansas. And yet the family in New York might be ineligible for aid, and will not count in the poverty population tallies used to allocate funds while the Arkansas family will receive aid, and will be counted. 
An August 7, 1994 New York Times editorial endorsing a version of this bill introduced in the 104th Congress sums it up nicely: 
The cost of food, rent and other consumer goods can be twice as high in Manhattan as in Little Rock, Ark. Yet the income cutoff for poverty programs is the same in both places, $14,769 for a family of four. That produces the ridiculous and unfair result that a Manhattan family earning $15,000 does not qualify for Federal nutrition or education programs while an Arkansas family earning $14,500--the equivalent of $29,000 in Manhattan--does. 
* * * Federal poverty levels are supposed to identify families that cannot buy minimally decent food, clothes and shelter. To act as if living costs do not matter, or as if financially strapped states will pick up where Washington leaves off, amounts to a vicious attack on the poor who happen to live in high-cost states. 
Professor Herman B. `Dutch' Leonard and Senior Research Associate Monica Friar of the Taubman Center for State and local government at Harvard have devised an index of poverty statistics that reflects the differences in the cost of living between States. If we look at the `Friar-Leonard State Cost-of-Living index,' as it has come to be known, we find that New York has a 
cost-adjusted poverty rate of 20.4 percent, the fifth highest in the Nation. Florida has the 12th highest adjusted poverty rate; Arkansas drops from 14th to 24th. New York fifth; Arkansas 24th. Georgia as the 25th highest. It is no longer the case that the incidence of poverty is highest in the Mississippi Delta or Appalachia. The fifth highest poverty rate is in New York. We seem not to have grasped this. 
In 1995, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panel of experts released a study on redefining poverty. Our poverty index dates back to the work of Social Security Administration economist Mollie Orshansky who, in the early 1960s, hit upon the idea of a nutritional standard, not unlike the `pennyloaf' of bread of the 18th century British poor laws. Our poverty standard would be three times the cost of the Department of Agriculture-defined minimally adequate `food basket.' During consideration of the Family Support Act of 1988, I included a provision mandating the National Academy of Sciences to determine if our poverty measure is outdated and how it might be improved. The study, edited by Constance F. Citro and Robert T. Michael, is entitled Measuring Poverty: A New Approach. A Congressional Research Service review of the report states:  
The NAS panel * * * makes several recommendations which, if fully adopted, could dramatically alter the way poverty in the U.S. is measured, how federal funds are allotted to the States, and how eligibility for many Federal programs is determined. The recommended poverty measure would be based on more items in the family budget, would take major noncash benefits and taxes into account, and would be adjusted for regional differences in living costs. 
* * * Under the current measure the share of the poor population living in each region was: Northeast: 16.9 percent; Midwest: 21.7 percent; South: 40.0 percent; and West: 21.4 percent. Under the proposed new measure, the estimated share in each region would be: Northeast: 18.9 percent; Midwest: 20.0 percent; South 36.4 percent; and West: 24.5 percent. 
Mr. President, our current poverty data are inaccurate. And these substandard data are used in allocation formulas used to distribute millions of Federal dollars each year. As a result, States with high costs of living--States like New York, Connecticut, Vermont, Hawaii, and California, just to name a few--are not getting their fair share of Federal dollars because differences in the cost of living are ignored. And the poor of these high cost States are penalized because they happen to live there. It is time to correct this inequity. 
I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial be inserted into the Record.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce two measures to help fight the epidemic of bullet-related violence in America: the Real Cost of Destructive Ammunition Act and the Destructive Ammunition Prohibition Act of 1997. The purpose of these bills is to prevent from reaching the marketplace some of the most deadly rounds of ammunition ever produced. 
Some of my colleagues may remember the Black Talon. It is a hollow-tipped bullet, singular among handgun ammunition in its capacity for destruction. Upon impact with human tissue, the bullet produces razor-sharp radial petals that produce a devastating wound. It is the very same bullet that a crazed gunman fired at unsuspecting passengers on a Long Island Railroad train in December 1993, Killing the husband of now Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy and injuring her son. That same month, it was also used in the shooting of Officer Jason E. White of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, just 15 blocks from the Capitol. 
I first learned of the Black Talon in a letter I received from Dr. E.J. Gallagher, director of Emergency Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital Trauma Center in the Bronx. Dr. Gallagher wrote that he has never seen a more lethal projectile. On November 3, 1993, I introduced a bill to tax the Black Talon at 10,000 percent. Nineteen days later, Olin Corp., the manufacturer of the Black Talon, announced that it would withdraw sale of the bullet to the general public. Unfortunately, the 103d Congress came to a close without the bill having won passage. 
As a result, there is nothing in law to prevent the reintroduction of this pernicious bullet, nor is there any existing impediment to the sale of similar rounds that might be produced by another manufacturer. So today I reintroduce the bill to tax the Black Talon as well as a bill to prohibit the sale of the Black Talon to the public. Both bills would apply to any bullet with the same physical characteristics as the Black Talon. These bullets have no place in the armory of criminals. 
It has been estimated that the cost of hospital services for treating bullet-related injuries is $1 billion per year, with the total cost to the economy of such injuries approximately $14 billion. We can ill afford further increases in this number, but this would surely be the result if bullets with the destructive capacity of the Black Talon are allowed onto the streets. 
Mr. President, despite the fact that the national crime rate has decreased in recent months, the number of deaths and injuries caused by bullet wounds is still at an unconscionable level. It is time we took meaningful steps to put an end to the massacres that occur daily as a result of gunshots. How better a beginning than to go after the most insidious culprits of this violence? I urge my colleagues to support these measures and to prevent these bullets from appearing on the market.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure to improve our information about the regulation and criminal use of ammunition and to prevent the irresponsible production of ammunition. This bill has three components. First, it would require importers and manufacturers of ammunition to keep records and submit an annual report to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [BATF] on the disposition of ammunition, including the amount, caliber and type of ammunition imported or manufactured. Second, it would require the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, to conduct a study of ammunition use and make recommendations on the efficacy of reducing crime by restricting access to ammunition. Finally, it would amend title 18 of the United States Code to raise the application fee for a license to manufacture certain calibers of ammunition. 
While there are enough handguns in circulation to last well into the 22d century, there is perhaps only a 4-year supply of ammunition. But how much of what kind of ammunition? Where does it come from? Where does it go? There are currently no reporting requirements for manufacturers or importers of ammunition; earlier reporting requirements were repealed in 1986. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's annual Uniform Crime Reports, based on information provided by local law enforcement agencies, does not record the caliber, type, or quantity of ammunition used in crime. In short, our data base is woefully inadequate. 
I supported the Brady law, which requires a waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, and the recent ban on semi-automatic weapons. But while the debate over gun control continues, I offer another alternative: Ammunition control. After all, as I have said before, guns do not kill people; bullets do. 
Ammunition control is not a new idea. In 1982 Phil Caruso of the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association asked me do something about armor-piercing bullets. Jacketed in tungsten or other materials, these rounds could penetrate four police flak jackets and five Los Angeles County telephone books. They are of no sporting value. I introduced legislation, the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act, to ban the cop-killer bullets in the 97th, 98th, and 99th Congresses. It enjoyed the overwhelming support of law enforcement groups and, ultimately, tacit support from the National Rifle Association. It was finally signed into law by President Reagan on August 28, 1986. 
The crime bill enacted in 1994 contained may amendment to broaden the 1986 ban to cover new thick steel-jacketed armor-piercing rounds. 
Out cities are becoming more ware of the benefits to be gained from ammunition control. The District of Columbia and some other cities prohibit a person from possessing ammunition without a valid license for a firearm of the same caliber or gauge as the ammunition. Beginning in 1990, the city of Los Angeles banned the sale of all ammunition 1 week prior to 
Independence Day and New Year's Day in an effort to reduce injuries and deaths caused by the firing of guns into the air. And in September 1994, the city of Chicago became the first in America to ban the sale of all handgun ammunition. 
Such efforts are laudable. But they are isolated attempts to cure what is in truth a national disease. We need to do more, but to do so, we need information to guide policymaking. This bill would fulfill that need by requiring annual reports to BATF by manufacturers and importers and by directing a study by the National Academy of Sciences. We also need to encourage manufacturers of ammunition to be more responsible. By substantially increasing application fees for licenses to manufacturer .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9-mm ammunition, this bill would discourage the reckless production of unsafe ammunition or ammunition which causes excesses damage. 
I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that comprehensively seeks to control the epidemic proportions of violence in America. This legislation, the Violent Crime Control Act of 1997, combines most of the provisions of two of the other crime-related bills I am introducing today as well. 
By including two different crime-related provisions, my bill attacks the crime epidemic on more than just one front. If we are truly serious about confronting our Nation's crime problem, we must learn more about the nature of the epidemic of bullet-related violence and ways to control it. To do this, we must require records to be keep on the disposition of ammunition. 
In October 1992, the Senate Finance Committee received testimony that public health and safety experts have, independently, concluded that there is an epidemic of bullet-related violence. The figures are staggering. 
In 1995, bullets were in the murders of 23,673 people in the United States. By focusing on bullets, and not guns, we recognize that much like nuclear waste, guns remain active for centuries. With minimum care, they do not deteriorate. However, bullets are consumed. Estimates suggest we have only a 4-years supply of them. 
Not only am I proposing that we tax bullets used disproportionately in crimes, 9 millimeter, .25 and .32 caliber bullets, I also believe we must set up a Bullet Death and Injury Control Program within the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. This Center will enhance our knowledge of the distribution and status of bullet-related death and injury and subsequently make recommendations about the extent and nature of bullet-related violence. 
So that the Center would have substantive information to study and analyze, this bill also requires importers and manufacturers of ammunition to keep records and submit an annual report to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms [BATF] on the disposition of ammunition. Currently, importers and manufacturers of ammunition are not required to do so. 
Clearly, it will take intense effort on all of our parts to reduce violent crime in America. We must confront this epidemic from several different range, recognizing that there is no simple solution.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I introduce two bills: the Violent Crime Reduction Act of 1997 and the Real Cost of Handgun Ammunition Act of 1997. Their purposes are to ban or heavily tax .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9 mm ammunition. These calibers of bullets are used disproportionately in crime. They are not sporting or hunting rounds, but instead are the bullets of choice for drug dealers and violent felons. Every year they contribute overwhelmingly to the pervasive loss of life caused by bullet wounds. 
Today marks the fourth time in as many Congresses that I have introduced legislation to ban or tax these pernicious bullets. As the terrible gunshot death toll in the United States continues unabated, so too does the need for these bills, which, by keeping these bullets out of the hands of criminals, would save a significant number of lives. 
The number of Americans killed or wounded each year by bullets demonstrates their true cost to American society. Just look at the data: 
In 1995, 13,673 people--68.2 percent of all people murdered--were murdered by gunshot. In addition, others lost their lives to bullets by shooting themselves, either purposefully or accidentally. And although no national statistics are kept on bullet-related injuries, studies suggest they occur two to five times more frequently than do deaths. 
The lifetime risk of death from homicide in U.S. males is 1 in 164, about the same as the risk of death in battle faced by U.S. servicemen in the Vietnam war. For black males, the lifetime risk of death from homicide is 1 in 28, twice the risk of death in battle faced by Marines in Vietnam. 
As noted by Susan Baker and her colleagues in the book `Epidemiology and Health Policy,' edited by Sol Levine and Abraham Lilienfeld:  
There is a correlation between rates of private ownership of guns and gun-related death rates; guns cause two-thirds of family homicides; and small easily concealed weapons comprise the majority of guns used for homicides, suicides and unintentional death. 
Baker states that: 
* * * these facts of the epidemiology of firearm-related deaths and injuries have important implications. Combined with their lethality, the widespread availability of easily concealed handguns for impetuous use by people who are angry, drunk, or frightened appears to be a major determinant of the high firearm death rate in the United States. Each contributing factor has implications for prevention. Unfortunately, issues related to gun control have evoked such strong sentiments that epidemiologic data are rarely employed to good advantage. 
Strongly held views on both sides of the gun control issue have made the subject difficult for epidemiologists. I would suggest that a good deal of energy is wasted in this never-ending debate, for gun control as we know it misses the point. We ought to focus on the bullets and not the guns. 
I would remind the Senate of our experience in controlling epidemics. Although the science of epidemiology traces its roots to antiquity--Hippocrates stressed the importance of considering environmental influences on human diseases--the first modern epidemiological study was conducted by James Lind in 1747. His efforts led to the eventual control of scurvy. It wasn't until 1795 that the British Navy accepted his analysis and required limes in shipboard diets. Most solutions are not perfect. Disease is rarely eliminated. But might epidemiology be applied in the case of bullets to reduce suffering? I believe so. 
In 1854 John Snow and William Farr collected data that clearly showed cholera was caused by contaminated drinking water. Snow removed the handle of the Broad Street pump in London to prevent people from drawing water from this contaminated water source and the disease stopped in that population. His observations led to a legislative mandate that all London water companies filter their water by 1857. Cholera epidemics subsided. Now treatment of sewage prevents cholera from entering our rivers and lakes, and the disinfection of drinking water makes water distribution systems uninhabitable for cholera vibrio, identified by Robert Koch as the causative agent 26 years after Snow's study. 
In 1900, Walter Reed identified mosquitos as the carriers of yellow fever. Subsequent mosquito control efforts by another U.S. Army doctor, William Gorgas, enabled the United States to complete the Panama Canal. The French failed because their workers were too sick from yellow fever to work. Now that it is known that yellow fever is caused by a virus, vaccines are used to eliminate the spread of the disease. 
These pioneering epidemiology success stories showed the world that epidemics require an interaction between three things: the host--the person who becomes sick or, in the case of bullets, the shooting victim); the agent--the cause of sickness, or the bullet); and the environment--the setting in which the sickness occurs or, in the case of bullets, violent behavior. Interrupt this epidemiological triad and you reduce or eliminate disease and injury. 
How might this approach applies to the control of bullet-related 
injury and death? Again, we are contemplating something different from gun control. There is a precedent here. In the middle of this century it was recognized that epidemiology could be applied to automobile death and injury. From a governmental perspective, this hypothesis was first adopted in 1959, late in the administration of Gov. Averell Harriman of New York State. In the 1960 Presidential campaign, I drafted a statement on the subject which was released by Senator John F. Kennedy as part of a general response to enquiries from the American Automobile Association. Then Senator Kennedy stated: 
Traffic accidents constitute one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest of the nation's public health problems. They waste as much as 2 percent of our gross national product every year and bring endless suffering. The new highways will do much to control the rise of the traffic toll, but by themselves they will not reduce it. A great deal more investigation and research is needed. Some of this has already begun in connection with the highway program. It should be extended until highway safety research takes its place as an equal of the many similar programs of health research which the federal government supports. 
Experience in the 1950's and early 1960's prior to passage of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, showed that traffic safety enforcement campaigns designed to change human behavior did not improve traffic safety. In fact, the death and injury toll mounted. I was Assistant Secretary of Labor in the mid-1960's when Congress was developing the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and I was called to testify. 
It was clear to me and others that motor vehicle injuries and deaths could not be limited by regulating driver behavior. Nonetheless, we had an epidemic on our hands and we needed to do something about it. My friend William Haddon, the first Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, recognized that automobile fatalities were caused not by the initial collision, when the automobile strikes some object, but by a second collision, in which energy from the first collision is transferred to the interior of the car, causing the driver and occupants to strike the steering wheel, dashboard, or other structures in the passenger compartment. The second collision is the agent of injury to the hosts--the car's occupants. 
Efforts to make automobiles crashworthy follow examples used to control infectious disease epidemics. Reduce or eliminate the agent of injury. Seatbelts, padded dashboards, and airbags are all specifically designed to reduce, if not eliminate, injury caused by the agent of automobile injuries, energy transfer to the human body during the second collision. In fact, we've done 
nothing revolutionary. All of the technology used to date to make cars crashworthy, including airbags, was developed prior to 1970. 
Experience shows the approach worked. Of course, it could have worked better, but it worked. Had we been able to totally eliminate the agent--the second collision--the cure would have been complete. Nonetheless, merely by focusing on simple, achievable remedies, we reduced the traffic death and injury epidemic by 30 percent. Motor vehicle deaths declined in absolute terms by 13 percent from 1980 to 1990, despite significant increases in the number of drivers, vehicles, and miles driven. Driver behavior is changing, too. National seatbelt usage is up dramatically, 60 percent now compared to 14 percent in 1984. These efforts have resulted in some 15,000 lives saved and 100,000 injuries avoided each year. 
We can apply that experience to the epidemic of murder and injury from bullets. The environment in which these deaths and injuries occur is complex. Many factors likely contribute to the rise in bullet-related injury. Here is an important similarity with the situation we faced 25 years ago regarding automobile safety. We found we could not easily alter the behavior of millions of drivers, but we could--easily--change the behavior of three or four automobile manufacturers. Likewise, we simply cannot do much to change the environment--violent behavior--in which gun-related injury occurs, nor do we know how. We can, however, do something about the agent causing the injury: bullets. Ban them. At least the rounds used disproportionately to cause death and injury; that is, the .25 caliber, .32 caliber, and 9 millimeter bullets. These three rounds account for the ammunition used in about 13 percent of licensed guns in New York City, yet they are involved in one-third of all homicides. They are not, as I have said, useful for sport or hunting. They are used for violence. If we fail to confront the fact that these rounds are used disproportionately in crimes, innocent people will continue to die. 
I have called on Congress during the past several sessions to ban or heavily tax these bullets. This would not be the first time that Congress has banned a particular round of ammunition. In 1986, it passed legislation written by the Senator from New York banning the so-called `cop-killer' bullet. This round, jacketed with tungsten alloys, steel, brass, or any number of other metals, had been demonstrated to penetrate no fewer than four police flak jackets and an additional five Los Angeles County phonebooks at one time. In 1982, the New York Police Benevolent Association came to me and asked me to do something about the ready availability of these bullets. The result was the Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act, which we introduced in 1982, 1983, and for the last time during the 99th Congress. In the end, with the tacit support of the National Rifle Association, the measure passed the Congress and was signed by the President as Public Law 99-408 on August 28, 1986. In the 1994 crime bill, we enacted my amendment to broaden the ban to 
include new thick steel-jacketed armor-piercing rounds. 
There are some 220 million firearms in circulation in the United States today. They are, in essence, simple machines, and with minimal care, remain working for centuries. However, estimates suggest that we have only a 4-year supply of bullets. Some 2 billion cartridges are used each year. At any given time there are some 7.5 billion rounds in factory, commercial, or household inventory. 
In all cases, with the exception of pistol whipping, gun-related injuries are caused not by the gun, but by the agents involved in the second collision: the bullets. Eliminating the most dangerous rounds would not end the problem of handgun killings. But it would reduce it. A 30-percent reduction in bullet-related deaths, for instance, would save over 10,000 lives each year and prevent up to 50,000 wounds. 
Water treatment efforts to reduce typhoid fever in the United States took about 60 years. Slow sand filters were installed in certain cities in the 1880's, and water chlorination treatment began in the 1910's. The death rate from typhoid in Albany, NY, prior to 1889, when the municipal water supply was treated by sand filtration, was about 100 fatalities per 100,000 people each year. The rate dropped to about 25 typhoid deaths per year after 1889, and dropped again to about 10 typhoid deaths per year after 1915, when chlorination was introduced. By 1950, the death rate from typhoid fever had dropped to zero. It will likely take longer than 60 years to eliminate bullet-related death and injury, but we need to start with achievable measures to break the deadly interactions between people, bullets, and violent behavior. 
The bills I introduce today would begin the process. They would begin to control the problem by banning or taxing those rounds used disproportionately in crime--the .25-caliber, .32-caliber, and 9-millimeter rounds. The bills recognize the epidemic nature of the problem, building on findings contained in the June 10, 1992 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which was devoted entirely to the subject of violence, principally violence associated with firearms. 
Mr. President, it is time to confront the epidemic of bullet-related violence. I urge my colleagues to support these bills.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce, along with Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, legislation to establish a commission to study the Federal Statistical System. 
Statistics are part of our constitutional arrangement, which provides for a decennial census that, among other purposes, is the basis for apportionment of membership in the House of Representatives. I quote from Article I, Section I: 
* * * enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. 
But, while the Constitution directed that there be a census, there was, initially, no Census Bureau. The earliest censuses were conducted by U.S. marshals. Later on, statistical bureaus in State governments collected the data, with a Superintendent of the Census overseeing from Washington. It was not until 1902 that a permanent Bureau of the Census was created by the Congress, housed initially in the Interior Department. In 1903 the Bureau was transferred to the newly established Department of Commerce and Labor. 
The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, which was originally an independent body, began collecting data in 1866. It too was transferred to the new Department of Commerce and Labor in 1903, but then was put in the Treasury Department in 1913 following ratification of the 16th amendment, which gave Congress the power to impose an income tax.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to repeal section 434 of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, and subsections (a) and (b) of section 642 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Section 434 of the first act provides that: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or local law, no State or local government entity may be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) information regarding the immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an alien in the United States. 
This provision, along with portions of section 642 of the aforementioned illegal immigration law, conflicts with an executive order, issued by the mayor of New York in 1985, prohibiting city employees from reporting suspected illegal aliens to the Immigration and Naturalization Service unless the alien has been charged with a crime. The executive order, which is similar to local laws in other States and cities, was intended to ensure that fear of deportation does not deter illegal aliens from seeking emergency medical attention, reporting crimes, and so forth. 
On September 8, 1995, during Senate consideration of H.R. 4, the Work Opportunity Act of 1995, Senators Santorum and Nickles offered this provision as an amendment. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 91 to 6. The Senators who voted `no' were: Akaka, Campbell, Inouye, Moseley-Braun, Moynihan, and Simon. 
Four of these six--Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Simon, and the Senator from New York--were also among the 11 Democrats who voted against H.R. 4 when it passed the Senate 11 days later on September 19, 1995. The provision remained in H.R. 3734, the welfare bill recently signed by President Clinton. 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City filed suit last year to challenge section 434 of the new welfare law and section 642 of the illegal immigration law in U.S. District Court and I introduced a similar bill at the time. The mayor's lawsuit deserves to succeed for the same reason this legislation deserves to pass: the provisions at issue are onerous and represent bad public policy.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, cosponsored by Senator Charles E. Grassley, to amend the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to establish qualification standards for individuals nominated for the position of Deputy Director of Demand Reduction in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
On May 17, 1988, then-Senate Majority Leader Robert S. Byrd established a working group on substance abuse which I was to co-chair with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. Interdiction and crackdown were then all the rage. My role on the working group was to assert that, other than to raise the price of drugs somewhat, interdiction was not going to have the slightest effect on supply. We saw the failure of supply side measures during Prohibition and in the French Connection model of cutting off production abroad. Accordingly, any comprehensive legislation should place at least equal emphasis on demand. 
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which became law on November 18 of that year, did just that. Section 2012 sets out the purposes of the law. They include: To increase to the greatest extent possible the availability and quality of treatment services so that treatment on request may be provided to all individuals desiring to rid themselves of their substance abuse problem. 
The legislation established an Office of National Drug Control Policy in the executive office of the President. It was headed by a so-called czar and included a deputy director of supply reduction and a deputy director for demand reduction. The Deputy Director for Demand would seek a clinical device, a pharmacological block, similar to methadone treatment for heroin. The Deputy Director would know the chemistry of the subject enough to promote some treatment beyond the sort of psychiatric treatment currently available. 
President Bush made extraordinary, fine appointments. He appointed Dr. William Bennett as the head of the office. As the Deputy Director for Demand Reduction he appointed Dr. Herbert Kleber, a physician at the Yale Medical School, a research scientist, and exactly the person you would want for this. 
Then, after a while, Bennett left, and Kleber also left. Kleber has gone to Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and is working at the New York Psychiatric Institute in this field. 
Nobody succeeded him in a scientific role. There have been a number of persons in the job. I am sure they are good persons, but they are nothing like what we had in mind in the legislation. 
The bill I introduce today would require that the Deputy Director of Demand Reduction have a scientific background and be a leader in the field of substance abuse prevention or treatment. This is no more than what the 1988 Act intended. We enacted a good statute which has been trivialized. If we are serious about getting hold of the drug dealer epidemic in this country, we must have an individual eminent in the field of substance abuse prevention leading the charge on demand reduction.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators D'Amato and Dodd in introducing the War Crime Disclosure Act. This legislation is a companion to a measure introduced in the House, sponsored by Representative Maloney. 
The measure is a simple one. It requires the disclosure of information under the Freedom of Information Act regarding individuals who participated in Nazi war crimes. 
Ideally, such documents would be made available to the public without further legislation and without having to go through the slow process involved in getting information through the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA]. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Researchers seeking information on Nazi war criminals are denied access to relevant materials in the possession of the U.S. Government, even when the disclosure of these documents no longer poses a threat to national security--if indeed such disclosure ever did. 
With the passing of time it becomes ever more important to document Nazi war crimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. The greater access which this legislation provides will add clarity of this important effort. I applaud those researchers who continue to pursue this important work. 
I would also like to call to the attention of my colleagues the excellent work of the Office of Special Investigations of the Department of Justice. This office has a monumental task and I would not wish to add to that burden or divert its officials from their primary goal of pursuing Nazi war criminals. To that end, I would note that this legislation does not apply to the Office of Special Investigations, as it is not identified in paragraph (1)(B) of the bill as a `specified agency.' I would also add that there is a provision in the bill which specifically prohibits the disclosure of information which would compromise the work of the Office of Special Investigations. 
I would like to thank Representative Maloney for her original work on this subject in the House of Representatives. I would also thank Senators D'Amato and Dodd for joining me in this effort here in the Senate.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to recognize the immeasurable debt which we owe to a leading Soviet dissident. Dr. Yuri F. Orlov, a founding member of the Soviet chapter of Amnesty International and founder of the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group (the first nation-wide organization in Soviet history to question government actions), who now lives in Ithaca, New York, is threatened by poverty. Yuri Orlov could not be stopped by the sinister forces of the Soviet Union and, no doubt, he will not be stopped by poverty. But I rise today in hopes that it will not come to that. 
Dr. Orlov's career as a dissident began while he was working at the famous Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics in Moscow. At the Institute in 1956 he made a pro-democracy speech which cost him his position and forced him to leave Moscow. He was able to return in 1972, whereupon he began his most outspoken criticism of the Soviet regime. 
On September 13, 1973, in response to a government orchestrated-public smear campaign against Audrei Sakharov, Orlov sent `Thirteen Questions to Brezhnev,' a letter which advocated freedom of the press and reform of the Soviet economy. One month later, he became a founding member of the Soviet chapter of Amnesty International. His criticism of the Soviet Union left him unemployed and under constant KGB surveillance, but he would not be silenced. 
In May, 1976 Dr. Orlov founded the Moscow Helsinki Watch Group to pressure the Soviet Union to honor the human rights obligations it had accepted under the Helsinki Accords signed in 1975. His leadership of the Helsinki Watch Group led to his arrest and, eventually, to a show trial in 1978. He was condemned to seven years in a labor camp and five years in exile. 
After having served his prison sentence, and while still in exile, Dr. Orlov was able to immigrate to the United States in 1986 in an exchange arranged by the Reagan Administration. A captured Soviet spy was returned in exchange for the release of Dr. Orlov and a writer for U.S. News & World Report who had been arrested in Moscow, Nicholas Daniloff. 
Since then, Dr. Orlov has served as a senior scientist at Cornell University in the Newman Laboratory of Nuclear Studies. Now that he is 72 years old, he is turning his thoughts to retirement. Unfortunately, since he has only been in the United States for 10 years, his retirement income from the Cornell pension plus Social Security will be insufficient: only a fraction of what Cornell faculty of comparable distinction now get at retirement. 
His scientific colleagues, Nobel physicist Dr. Hans A. Bethe, Kurt Gottfried of Cornell, and Sidney Drell of Stanford, have made concerted efforts to raise support for Dr. Orlov's retirement, but they are in further need. 
To this end, I have agreed to assist these notable scientists in their endeavor to secure a more appropriate recompense for this heroic dissident. That is the purpose that brings me here to the Senate floor today, on the first day of the 105th Congress, to introduce a bill on Dr. Orlov's behalf. While I acknowledge the daunting prospects that face private relief bills these days, I offer the bill at least as a step toward bringing the kind of attention to Dr. Orlov's situation which he deserves. 
To understand Dr. Orlov's contributions to ending the Cold War, I would draw my colleagues attention to his autobiography, Dangerous Thoughts: Memoirs of a Russian Life. It captures the fear extant in Soviet society and the courage of men like Orlov, Sakharov, Sharansky, Solzhenitsyn, and others who defied the Soviet regime. Dr. Orlov, who spent 7 years in a labor camp and two years in Siberian exile, never ceased protesting against oppression. Despite deteriorating health and the harsh conditions of the camp, Dr. Orlov smuggled out messages in support of basic rights and nuclear arms control. His bravery and that of his dissident colleagues played no small role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I am sure many would agree that we owe them a tremendous debt. This then is a call to all those who agree with that proposition. Dr. Orlov is now in need; please join our endeavor.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, cosponsored by Senator D'Amato, to provide for the relief and payment of an equitable claim to the estate of Dr. Beatrice Braude. 
Mr. President, this is a measure of justice which brings back memories of an old and awful time. Dr. Braude, a linguist fluent in several languages, was dismissed from her position at the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1953 as a result of accusations of disloyalty to the United States. The accusations were old; two years earlier, the State Department's Loyalty Security Board had investigated and unanimously voted to dismiss them. The Board sent a letter to Dr. Braude stating `there is no reasonable doubt as to your loyalty to the United States Government or as to your security risk to the Department of State.' 
Dr. Braude was terminated one day after being praised for her work and informed that she probably would be promoted. USIA officials told her that the termination was due to budgetary constraints. Congress had funded the USIA at a level 27 percent below the President's request. The Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1954 (Public Law 83-207) authorized a reduction in force commensurate to the budget cut. Fair enough. As Dr. Braude remarked years later, `I never felt that I had a lien on a government job.' But what Dr. Braude did not know is that she was selected for termination because of the old--and answered--charges against her. And because she did not know the real reason for her dismissal, she was denied certain procedural rights (the right to request a hearing, for instance). 
The true reason for her dismissal was kept hidden from her. When she was unable, over the next several years, to secure employment anywhere else within the Federal Government--even in a typing pool despite a perfect score on the typing test--she became convinced that she had been blacklisted. She spent the next 30 years fighting to regain employment and restore her reputation. Though she succeeded in 1982 (at the age of 69) in securing a position in the CIA as a language instructor, she still had not been able to clear her name by the time of her death in 1988. The irony of the charges against Dr. Braude is that she was an anti-communist, having witnessed first-hand communist-sponsored terrorism in Europe while she was an assistant cultural affairs officer in Paris and, for a brief period, an exchange officer in Bonn during the late 1940s and early 1950s. 
Mr. President, I would like to review the charges against Dr. Braude because they are illustrative of that dark era and instructive to us even today. There were a total of four. First, she was briefly a member of the Washington Book Shop at Farragut Square that the Attorney General later labeled subversive. Second, she had been in contact with Mary Jane Keeney, a Communist Party activist employed at the United Nations. Third, 
she had been a member of the State Department unit of the Communist-dominated Federal Workers' Union. Fourth, she was an acquaintance of Judith Coplon. 
With regard to the first charge, Dr. Braude had indeed joined the Book Shop shortly after her arrival in Washington in 1943. She was eager to meet congenial new people and a friend recommended the Book Shop, which hosted music recitals in the evenings. I must express some sensitivity here: my F.B.I. records report that I was observed several times at a `leftist musical review' in suburban Hampstead while I was attending the London School of Economics on a Fulbright Fellowship. 
Dr. Braude was aware of the undercurrent of sympathy with the Russian cause at the Book Shop, but her membership paralleled a time of close U.S.-Soviet collaboration. She drifted away from the Book Shop in 1944 because of her distaste for the internal politics of other active members. Her membership at the Book Shop was only discovered when her name appeared on a list of delinquent dues. It appears that her most sinister crime while a member of the book shop was her failure to return a book on time. 
Dr. Braude met Mary Jane Keeney on behalf of a third woman who actively aided Nazi victims after the war and was anxious to send clothing to another woman in occupied Germany. Dr. Braude knew nothing of Keeney's political orientation and characterized the meeting as a transitory experience. 
With regard to the third charge, Dr. Braude, in response to an interrogatory from the State Department's Loyalty Security Board, argued that she belonged to an anti-Communist faction of the State Department unit of the Federal Workers' Union. 
Remember that the Loyalty Security Baird invested these charges and exonerated her. 
The fourth charge, which Dr. Braude certainly did not--or could not--deny, was her friendship with Judith Coplon. Braude met Coplon in the summer of 1945 when both women attended a class Herber Marcuse taught at American University. They saw each other infrequently thereafter. In May 1948, Coplon wrote to Braude, then stationed in Paris and living in a hotel on the Left Bank, to announce that she would be visiting shortly and needed a place to stay. Dr. Braude arranged for Coplon to stay at the hotel. Coplon stayed for 6 weeks, during which time Dr. Braude found her behavior very trying. The two parted on unfriendly terms. The friendship they had prior to parting was purely social. 
Mr. President, Judith Coplon was a spy. She worked in the Justice Department's Foreign Agents Registration Division, an office integral to the FBI's counter-intelligence efforts. She was arrested early in 1949 while handing over notes on counterintelligence operations to Soviet citizen Valentine Gubitchev, a United Nations employee. Coplon was tried and convicted--there was no doubt of her guilt--but the conviction was overturned on a technicality. Gubitchev was also convicted but was allowed to return to the U.S.S.R. because of his quasi-diplomatic status. 
My involvement in Dr. Braude's case dates back to early 1979, when Dr. Braude came to me and my colleague at the time, 
Senator Javits, and asked us to introduce private relief legislation on her behalf. In 1974, after filing a Freedom of Information Act request and finally learning the true reason for her dismissal, she filed suit in the Court of Claims to clear her name and seek reinstatement and monetary damages for the time she was prevented from working for the Federal Government. The Court, however, dismissed her case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired. On March 5, 1979, Senator Javits and I together introduced a bill, S. 546, to waive the statute of limitations on Dr. Braude's case against the U.S. Government and to allow the Court of Claims to render judgment on her claim. The bill passed the Senate on January 30, 1980. Unfortunately, the House failed to take action on the bill before the 96th Congress adjourned. 
In 1988, and again in 1990, 1991, and 1993, Senator D'Amato and I re-introduced similar legislation on Dr. Braude's behalf. Our attempts met with repeated failure. Until at last, on September 21, 1993, we secured passage of Senate Resolution 102, which referred S. 840, the bill we introduced for the relief of the estate of Dr. Braude, to the Court of Claims for consideration as a congressional reference action. The measure compelled the Court to determine the facts underlying Dr. Braude's claim and to report back to Congress on its findings. 
The Court held a hearing on the case in November of 1995 and on March 7 of last year Judge Roger B. Andewelt of the Court of Federal Claims issued his verdict that the USIA had wrongfully dismissed Dr. Braude and intentionally concealed the reason for her termination. He concluded that such actions constituted an equitable claim for which compensation is due. Forty-three years after her dismissal from the USIA and 8 years after her death, the Court found in favor of the estate of Dr. Braude. 
Senator D'Amato and I wish to express our profound admiration for Judge Andewelt's decision in which he absolved Dr. Beatrice Braude of the surreptitious charges of disloyalty with which she was never actually confronted. The Court declared that Dr. Braude `cared about others deeply and was loyal to her friends, family and country.' 
We are equally grateful to Christopher N. Sipes and William Livingston, Jr. of Covington & Burling, two of the many lawyers who have handled Dr. Braude's case on a pro bono basis over the years. Mr. Sipes quite properly remarked that the decision represents an important page in the annals of U.S. history: `The Court of the United States has said it recognizes that this conduct is out of bounds. It tells the government it must acknowledge its wrongs and pay for them.' 
Justice Department attorneys have reached a settlement with lawyers representing the estate of Dr. Beatrice Braude concerning monetary damages equitably due for the wrongful dismissal of Dr. Braude from her Federal job in 1953 and subsequent blacklisting. The estate will receive $200,000 in damages. Family members have announced that the funds--which Congress must now appropriate--will be donated to Hunter College, the institution from which Dr. Braude received her bachelor's degree. 
Now that the parties to the Braude case have reached an 
agreement on the monetary damages equitably due to Dr. Braude's estate, Senator D'Amato and I are offering legislation to release the $200,000 to her estate. I hope that we will have the unqualified and unanimous support of our colleagues. 
What happened to Dr. Braude was a personal tragedy. But it was also part of a national tragedy, too. This Nation lost, prematurely and unnecessarily, the exceptional services of a gifted and dedicated public servant. Stanley I. Kutler, a professor of constitutional history at the University of Wisconsin, estimates that Dr. Braude was one of about 1,500 Federal employees who were dismissed as security risks between 1953 and 1956. Another 6,000 resigned under the pressure of security and loyalty inquiries, according to Professor Kutler, who testified as an expert witness on Dr. Braude's behalf. It was, as I said earlier, an awful time. We had settled `as on a darkling plain, Swept with confused alarm of struggle and flight, Where ignorant armies clash by night.' It must not happen again.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act. This bill will amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to allow the use of age-based incentives for the voluntary retirement of tenured faculty at colleges and universities. I am pleased that Senator Ashcroft is an original cosponsor of this legislation. 
Since the late 1950s, there has been a vast expansion in the number of individuals pursuing careers in academia. Now, an unusually large cohort of tenured faculty make it difficult for universities to hire more recent graduates. As a practical matter, it is extremely difficult or costly or both for institutions to bring on new tenured faculty except where tenure positions open up as a result of retirement. In order for academic institutions to remain effective centers of teaching and scholarship they must have a balance of old and new faculty. This balance, however, is threatened by continuing uncertainties created by recent legislation. 
I support the ADEA, but when it was amended in 1986 to extend the protections of the act to individuals age 70 and over, I expressed concern that the application of this change to the unique situation of tenured faculty members at colleges and universities would affect teaching and scholarship at these institutions. While it did include an exemption from the provisions for the bill for tenured faculty, the exemption only lasted seven years. Therefore, I was pleased when that bill included a request for the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to appoint a commission to study the impact of removing the mandatory retirement age for faculty members at colleges and universities. 
When the National Research Council released this study, Ending Mandatory Retirement for Tenured Faculty: The Consequences for Higher Education, on behalf of NAS in 1991, the report concluded that diminished faculty turnover--particularly at research universities--could increase costs and limit institutional flexibility in responding to changing academic needs, particularly with regard to necessary hires in new and existing disciplines. In concluding that there was `no strong basis for continuing the exemption for tenured faculty,' the NAS report presumed that the Federal government would allow `Practical steps' such as age-based early-retirement incentives to mitigate the impact of an uncapped retirement age for tenured faculty. Specifically, the NAS report stated: `The committee recommends that Congress, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission permit colleges and universities to offer faculty voluntary-retirement incentive programs that are not classified as an employee benefit, include an upper age limit for participants and limit participation on the basis of institutional needs.' 
These practical steps, however, were not taken although the exemption was allowed to run out. Instead, passage of the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA) further confused the issue. OWBPA made early-retirement incentives permissible in the context of defined-benefit retirement plans but did not address the status of such incentives in the context of defined-contribution retirement plans. Defined-contribution retirement plans are most popular with tenured faculty due to their pension portability. The OWBPA did not preclude defined-contribution retirement plans, but by not addressing the issue at all, it added to the ambiguity surrounding the matter. Functionally, early-retirement incentives operate in the same manner for both types of plans. There is continued uncertainty, however, whether early-retirement incentives with an upper-age limit that are offered to tenured faculty conflict with the purpose of ADEA of prohibiting arbitrary age discrimination. 
I am troubled by the continued uncertainty created by these bills, and I hope that the Faculty Retirement Incentive Act will provide a `safe harbor' for colleges and universities by clarifying that the early retirement incentives are permitted by the ADEA. Universities must ensure that older faculty members retire at an appropriate age, not simply to `make room' for younger faculty, but to maintain a contemporary, innovative, and creative atmosphere at our nation's colleges and universities.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a most important piece of legislation for the State of New York, and to ask my Senate colleagues for their support. This bill directs the Secretary of the Army to repair a section of waterfront parkland in the Bronx, New York, known as Orchard Beach. My colleague in New York City, Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, has worked hard for many years to get this beach--so beloved by the citizens of the Bronx--restored to its former glory. 
Orchard Beach is a splendid natural sanctuary and recreational spot within the Bronx, which is one of New York City's most urbanized areas. Orchard Beach provides a welcome respite from urban living and is particularly valued by low-income families with children who cannot afford summer homes or trips to the tonier beach resorts on Long Island or the Jersey shore. Over two million people visit Orchard Beach annually. For many of New York's working families, it offers the only affordable and convenient place for their children to play in the sea and sand. 
In addition, the beach and surrounding wetlands and salt marshes provide a vital habitat for many marine creatures, including crabs, lobsters, striped bass and winter flounder, as well as numerous species of overwintering waterfowl. 
But today, the beach is in urgent need of repair--there is widespread erosion due to repeated storm damage, threatening both the recreational utility of the beach and the stability of the animal and ocean life habitats. It seems only appropriate that we come to the rescue of this treasure now before irreversible damage is done. 
In the Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996, a total of $5.6 million was authorized to study and then conduct an Orchard Beach shoreline protection project to address storm damage prevention, recreation, and environmental restoration. The bill I introduce today would help to ensure that this important project for New York goes forward.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my friend and colleagues, Senator D'Amato, a bill to designate President Grant's tomb a national monument. This April 27 will be the centennial of the dedication of the tomb. I can think of no better observance than to pass this designation and the other provisions in this bill that would protect and preserve the tomb and make it more attractive to visitors. 
The Nation owes President Grant a great debt for his efforts during the Civil War alone. He proved to be the capable general President Lincoln lacked in the early years of that conflict. Grant provided the leadership, strategy, determination, and courage to do what was necessary to win the war. He should also be remembered for his efforts to include Blacks in the Union Army and later for his relentless opposition to the Ku Klux Klan. Many Southerners appreciated his generous terms with General Lee, which included allowing Lee's men to keep their horses for the spring plowing. Grant went on to become the eighteenth President and to serve two terms. 
In 1881 the former President moved to New York City, and four years later to Mount McGregor near Saratoga. He died in 1885. In the next few years, 90,000 people contributed to a fundraising effort that brought in $600,000. This was enough to build structure on Riverside Drive in Manhattan modeled on the tombs of the Emperor Hadrian in Rome, Napoleon in Paris, and King Mausolis in Turkey. Inside are two eight-and-a-half ton sarcophagi made of Wisconsin red granite and a great mural depicting Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. 
The tomb became a leading attraction for New York residents and for tourists. However, the neighborhood around the tomb has changed in recent years and visitorship is down. Vandalism is an ongoing concern. This bill takes several steps that are past due to protect and preserve the tomb. 
The bill would make Grant's Tomb a National Monument and require the Secretary of the Interior to `administer, repair, restore, preserve, maintain, and promote' the tomb in accordance with the law applicable to all National Monuments. It requires the Secretary to build a visitors center. It also calls for a study over two years to plan interpretive programs, restoration, and security and maintenance. 
This bill addresses the needs at Grant's Tomb. It can again become a leading attraction in New York. More important, the bill does what is right for the memory of our eighteenth President.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution in response to the egregious prison sentence which was recently imposed by the Chinese Government on Ngawang Choephel. 
Mr. Choephel is a Tibetan whose family fled Chinese oppression to live in exile in India in 1968. He studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont as a Fulbright Scholar in 1992 and 1993, after having studied at the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts in Dharamsala, India. The Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts was formed by the Dalai Lama to preserve the Tibetan performing arts while in exile. 
Mr. Choephel returned to Tibet in July, 1995 to prepare a documentary film about traditional Tibetan performing arts. He was detained in August, 1995 by the Chinese authorities and held incommunicado for over a year before the Government of the People's Republic of China admitted to holding him, and finally charged him with espionage in October, 1996. 
On December 26, 1996, the Chinese Government sentenced Ngawang Choephel to an 18 year prison term plus four years subsequent deprivation of his political rights following a secret trial. This is the most severe sentence of a Tibetan by the Chinese Government in seven years. 
There is no evidence that Mr. Choephel's activities in Tibet involved anything other than purely academic research. His arrest and the long sentence subsequently imposed appear to stem from his collecting information to preserve Tibetan performing arts. Such censure is indicative of the extreme measures the Chinese Government continues to take to repress all forms of Tibetan cultural expression. My daughter, Maura Moynihan, has traveled to Tibet several times. After her most recent trip last year, she wrote in the Washington Post of the Chinese assault on Tibetan religion and culture: 
Beijing's leaders have renewed their assault on Tibetan culture, especially Buddhism, with an alarming vehemence. The rhetoric and the methods of the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s have been resurrected--reincarnated, what you will--to shape an aggressive campaign to vilify the Dalai Lama. 
The New York Times echoed just such sentiments in its January 2 editorial on Ngawang Choephel's arrest:  
The basis of Ngawang Choepel's conviction is unclear, but even taping Tibetan culture for export could qualify as espionage under Chinese law. Since its invasion of Tibet in 1950, Beijin has gradually increased its efforts to erase Tibet's identity. China has arrested those who protested the takeover and tried to eradicate the people's affection for the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama. 
Ngawang Choephel is a symbol of the Chinese Government's continued pursuit of Maoist policies when dealing with what it sees at the `Tibet problem.' Tibetan religion and culture are seen by the Chinese as an impediment to successfully unifying Tibet with the `motherland.' 
This resolution will record the United States Senate's response to these Chinese policies, which we reject. In the words of the International Commission of Jurists in 1960, `Tibet demonstrated from 1913 to 1950 the conditions of statehood as generally accepted under international law.' We will continue to stand with the Tibetan people. As the Senate recorded in 1991 in S. Res. 107: * * * the government of the People's Republic of China should know that as the Tibetan people and His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet go forward on their journey toward freedom the Congress and the people of the United States stand with them. 
I thank all my colleagues who have cosponsored this resolution. In particular I would like to recognize the long commitment that the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has shown in support of Tibetans and thank him for joining me in this effort today. 
I would especially note the work of the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy. Since Mr. Choephel was reported missing, Senator Leahy has sought to win his release. In November, Senator Leahy, while traveling on a delegation to China with the Senate Democratic Leader and other Senators, raised his concerns directly to Chinese President Jiang Zemin. I thank Senator Leahy for his commitment to this issue and for agreeing to cosponsor this measure. 
I ask unanimous consent to have the New York Times editorial on this subject placed in the Record. 
From the New York Times, Jan. 2, 1997

 Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on Thursday, January 2, in the first civil action of 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, a lawsuit was filed challenging the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996. On this the first day of legislative business in the first session of the 105th Congress, I rise as one of the plaintiffs in the suit to inform the Senate that this action has commenced--as specifically provided for in the Line-Item Veto Act. Section 3(a) of the act provides that:  
Any Member of Congress or any individual adversely affected . . . may bring an action, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground that any provision of this part violates the Constitution. 
Six Members of Congress, led by our distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Robert C. Byrd, have joined together to bring this suit, which is captioned Byrd et al. v. Raines et al., Civil Action No. 97-001. The other plaintiffs are the Senator from New York, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin; the former Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield; Representative Waxman of California and Representative Skaggs of Colorado. 
I will simply restate for the Record what I said during our debates on this legislation during the last Congress. The Line-Item Veto Act effectuated an unprecedented and unconstitutional allocation of power from the legislative branch to the executive. 
The law--Public Law 104-130--which took effect on January 1 of this year, gives the President the authority to cancel any specific appropriation, any item of new direct spending, or any limited tax benefit contained in a bill that the President has just signed into law. 
Senators Byrd, Hatfield, Levin, and Congressmen Waxman and Skaggs and I have filed this suit because we believe the act violates article I of the Constitution, which requires that a bill be passed by a majority vote in both houses of Congress and either approved or vetoed in its entirety by the President. The line-item veto gives the President the power to unilaterally repeal, without congressional approval, portions of laws which he has already signed. 
In 1983, the Supreme Court declared in INS v. Chadha [462 U.S. 919, 954] that, and I quote: 
It emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative action in Article I, Section 7, represents the Framers' decision that the legislative power of the Federal government be exercised in accord with a single finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure. 
The Line-Item Veto Act departs dramatically from that `single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered procedure' for making or changing Federal law. The Constitution could not be more clear on this point. The presentment clause of article I, section 7 states: 
Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it. . . . 
The Line-Item Veto Act unconstitutionally expands the President's power by authorizing him to approve a bill and sign it into law and, from an instant up to 5 days later, disapprove and return parts of the bill, so that the parts of the bill disapproved by the President do not have the force and effect of law. The act also violates the requirements of bicameral passage and presentment by granting to the President, acting alone, the authority to cancel and thus repeal provisions of law. 
Even if, as some have argued, the President will exercise this power sparingly, his ability to do so will forever shift the balance of power. A balance the Framers deemed fragile, and necessary for the proper functioning of the American Government. The Framers gave the power of the purse to Congress and Congress alone; Madison made the reason abundantly clear in Federalist No. 58: 
This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure. 
Whether the Line-Item Veto Act is viewed as granting the President a unilateral power of line-item revision of bills that have been presented for his signature, or as granting him a unilateral power to repeal portions of duly enacted laws, the act grants powers to the President that contravene the constitutional process for making Federal law. I might understand if the President were trying to seize this power. But why have we given it to him? The lawsuit filed earlier this month will allow the judiciary to review this issue under an expedited schedule. We hope to have a decision in the case by the Supreme Court in the next October term, and I will provide periodic updates on the progress of the case for the Record.

Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last January, I outlined a brief two-step plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. I proposed that we correct for overindexation of Government programs resulting from using the Consumer Price Index [CPI], and that we postpone tax cuts. Starting with the President's budget proposals, and using CBO scoring, these two steps would have produced a balanced budget by 2002. 
I now present my second, and if we act quickly my last, annual plan to balance the budget. As under the first plan, balancing the budget is relatively easy if we correct for overindexation and forgo tax cuts. 
The Congressional Budget Office is expected to estimate the baseline deficit in 2002 at about $200 billion. If Congress acts now to balance the budget by 2002, interest rates will fall, economic growth will increase, and CBO will declare a fiscal dividend in 2002 of about $50 billion. So Congress need only find $150 billion in 2002. 
Here is how to get that $150 billion: 
In billions of dollars   
 55 
Reduce Growth in Medicare and Medicaid by at least amount in President's FY 1997 budget 
 45 
Slow Annual Growth in Discretionary (both defense and non defense) by about 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points 
 50 
Total Savings in 2002 
 150 
These steps can be modified; for example, revenues from reinstating expired excise taxes can be used to finance high priority investments or avoid reductions in important domestic discretionary programs. But the point remains. With the correction for overindexation a balanced budget is within sight. Without the correction, we will have a protracted fiscal crisis.
