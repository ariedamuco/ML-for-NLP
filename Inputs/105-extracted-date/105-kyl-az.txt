Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while many parts of this bill concern me, the part that I am very proud of is a provision known as the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998. It has been my pleasure to have worked with Senator Coverdell and I commend him for guiding the drug-free workplace bill through the Small Business Committee with a unanimous bipartisan vote. I would also like to thank Representatives Portman, Bishop, and Souder for their work in passing this important anti-drug legislation out of the House. 
The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 is an excellent example of how the federal government can work to encourage drug-free workplaces without placing heavy-handed mandates on businesses. It fosters partnerships between small businesses and organizations which have at least two years experience in carrying out drug-free workplace programs. It also will educate and encourage small businesses about the advantages of implementing drug-free workplace programs. 
Small businesses often feel they lack the money or the expertise to implement drug testing programs. That is why the drug-free workplace bill performs such a worthwhile function. Many small firms would like to start drug testing programs but don't have the ability to overcome the start up costs. This anti-drug measure provides resources to assist and educate employers who want the help in implementing drug-free workplace programs. 
As we all know, the American workforce is the main catalyst behind the tremendous economy that we are enjoying today. It is absolutely integral to a country's economic well being that it have a competent, able workforce. Our ability to maintain the high achievements of this workforce hinges largely on our ability to keep drugs out of the workplace. 
Drug use can take a tremendous toll. For example, 70% of drug users are employed. Employees who use drugs: Have greater absenteeism; have increased use of health services and insurance benefits; have increased risk of accidents; and have decreased productivity. 
The costs of drug use are not only confined to the user, just consider these disturbing statistics: Nearly half of all industrial accidents in the United States are related to drugs or alcohol; and drug and alcohol abusers file five times as many workman's compensation claims as non-abusers, and require 300 percent greater medical benefits. 
Businesses need help dealing with the problem of drug use--especially small businesses. Thomas Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified before the House Subcommittee on Empowerment that a large impediment in the implementation of drug programs is the perceived costs and problems with the actual initiation of the programs. 
The Drug-Free Workplace Act is fair to everyone. It's fair for the workers who are put at risk by their colleagues' drug abuse. It's fair to businesses, because it gives them the tools they need, but only if they want them. it's also fair to society, which ultimately foots the costly bill that drug abuse brings.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the better part of the last year, we have been considering what to do with projected budget surpluses should they ever materialize. Some people suggested setting aside the excess money to help save Social Security. Some wanted to use a portion for tax relief, or paying down the national debt. I believe there was merit in each of those ideas. 
It did not take long, however, for all of the good ideas to be swept aside once the surplus actually materialized. Just three weeks after confirming that the federal government achieved its first budget surplus in a generation, we have a bill before the Senate that proposes to use a third of the surplus to increase spending on government programs other than Social Security, tax relief, or repayment of the national debt. 
I am very disappointed that we find ourselves in this situation. President Clinton pledged in his State of the Union address to `save every penny of any surplus' for Social Security, yet he was the first in line with a long list of programs to be funded out of the budget surplus. And Congress appears willing to go along. I, for one, intend to vote against this raid on a surplus that should be saved for Social Security or tax relief. 
Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office tells my office that it has not yet determined the cost of the omnibus spending bill, and may not be able to do so for some time. However, if you total the figures included in the conference report, it appears that the cost will approach $520 billion--that is, if funding for the International Monetary Fund and emergency agriculture money is included. I am looking at Division A of the bill--for mandatory and discretionary programs. 
That compares to $447 billion for the same programs only a year ago. In other words, we are being asked to approve a bill that proposes to increase spending 16 percent in a single year. That does not even take into account the extra spending--another $21 billion--that is to be financed out of the budget surplus. 
That is just too much. To put things into perspective, the average increase provided by the FY99 spending bills I supported earlier in the year amounted to just 0.1 percent--a spending freeze, in effect. If we are to keep the budget balanced and preserve our options on how to use the budget surplus, we need to follow a more responsible path. This bill, with its raid on the budget surplus, represents a dangerous return to the old ways of budget-busting, bigger government. 
Mr. President, let me say a few things about the process that spawned this bill. Eight of the regular appropriations bills are wrapped into this package. A so-called emergency spending bill is attached, bringing the total cost of the legislation to over a half-trillion dollars. It is massive. It is no way to do the people's business responsibly. 
I recognize that our leadership had little choice but to make the best of a bad situation, given President Clinton's propensity to shut the government down if he does not get his way. Indeed, one of the President's representatives admitted as much to the Majority Leader a few weeks ago when he said the White House would shut down the government if it was in its political interest to do so. That is reprehensible. 
Still, our leadership did manage to secure some very good things in this bill--things that I would support if they could be separated out and considered on their own merits. Important funding for our nation's defense, anti-drug efforts, and increased law enforcement in Indian country is included. There are resources for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, provisions to alleviate problems in the implementation of new border-security systems, funding for the National Institutes of Health, and programs to help victims of domestic violence. 
However, by failing to prioritize spending, the bill simply throws more money at bad programs as well as good ones. It is easy to please everyone by spending more and more money. Yet that is a sure prescription for a return to the customary budget deficits we worked so hard to eliminate. 
The fact is, this bill was written by a handful of congressional Members and staff and the White House behind closed doors. Most Members of Congress have not had a chance to review it, debate it, or offer amendments. That means our constituents have been shut out of the process. This is a risky and dangerous precedent that I believe we will come to regret. 
Mr. President, while there are a number of good items in this bill--items I support--on balance, I believe it blurs the difference between two competing philosophies of government and, as I said before, represents a dangerous return to the old ways of budget-busting, bigger Government, and less freedom. 
I will vote no.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am concerned over our inability to advance good policy on encryption this Congress. The Senate has held many hearings on encryption, and there have been a number of bills introduced, with nothing concrete to show for it. What these bills have in common is an approach that would fold all aspects of national policy on encryption into one legislative vehicle. That has been a recipe for gridlock. 
Meanwhile, terrorist and criminals and drug lords are increasingly using encryption to hide their acts from law enforcement investigators. This already serious problem will continue to worsen unless we find some way to level the playing field. 
In committee, I offered an amendment I believed to be noncontroversial. It would criminalize the use of encryption in furtherance of a crime. It echoes language that appeared in each and every encryption bill introduced this Congress. And yet, it was rejected by some Members because it did not address other aspects of encryption policy. We need to get beyond this all-or-nothing approach.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as you know, over the past year there has been a great deal of discussion in Washington about the growing ballistic missile threat to the United States and our forces and friends abroad. Although Members of Congress and the Administration have not always agreed on how to best respond to this growing threat, I think we can all agree that the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, chaired by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, has made an indispensable contribution to the debate. The bipartisan, nine-member commission included many of our nation's most prominent experts on national security affairs. Due to Don Rumsfeld's leadership, this diverse group with divergent views on many policy issues, came together and produced an outstanding report that unanimously concluded that the ballistic missile threat to the U.S. is greater than previously assessed, that rogue nations like Iran could develop long-range missiles capable of reaching the U.S. in as little as five years, and that we might have little or no warning that such a threat had developed.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, September 30 marked the end of fiscal year 1998, and, for the first time since 1969, the news is written in black ink, not red. Although the final numbers will not be available for a few more weeks, it appears that the federal government will end the year with a unified budget surplus of about $70 billion. 
Mr. President, this is truly a dramatic turnaround. After all, it was only three years ago that President Clinton submitted a budget plotting $200 billion deficits well into the next century. I recall that skeptics back then often derided a balanced budget as a risky idea, something that could even threaten Social Security. Now, however, the skeptics seem to concede what many of us have been saying all along--that a balanced budget is good for America and good for Social Security. 
What does a balanced budget mean for hard-working Americans? For one thing, it means lower interest rates. The rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage might be as high as 9.5 percent, instead of the current average of about 6.6 percent, had Washington continued to rack up deficits as large as those experienced in the early 1990s. 
The savings from lower interest rates can be substantial. Just a one point drop on a $100,000 mortgage amounts to monthly savings of $67, or more than $24,000 over the 30-year term of a mortgage. We are talking here, not about just a one point drop, but rates that are two to three points lower than just a few years ago. 
Lower interest rates on student loans make a college education more affordable for young people, and lower rates on car loans mean that hard-working men and women all around the country can stretch their budgets a little farther. A balanced budget literally means money in people's pockets. 
The first thing we should do at the beginning of this new fiscal year is commit that we will maintain a balanced federal budget for the American people. We can certainly debate what to do with emerging budget surpluses, but there should be no longer be any debate that our national policy ought to be to keep the budget in balance. 
Mr. President, now that the budget is finally in balance, we have the unique opportunity to consider other issues without the cloud of big deficits hanging overhead. For example, we ought to consider whether tax rates are at their optimal level, or whether they are too high. By definition, a budget surplus means that our government is collecting more than is necessary for current operations. People are paying simply paying more than they need to. 
Perhaps, instead of keeping tax rates higher than they need to be, we ought to reduce income-tax rates across the board--for single people and married couples, people with children and those without, young people just getting a start and seniors trying to make ends meet on fixed incomes. It seems to me that every taxpaying American deserves a break. 
We could also reduce taxes on savings and investment--lower the tax on capital gains and eliminate the death tax--two things that would help keep the already lengthy economic expansion from petering out. If we have learned anything from recent experience, it is that a strong economy, more than tax-rate increases or modest spending cuts, is what it takes to turn budget deficits into surpluses. The booming economy has been pouring billions of extra tax dollars into the Treasury. If we want that revenue flow to continue, we need to be sure that tax policy is conducive to sustained economic growth. 
But the fact is, tax relief is not going to pass this year. President Clinton has already indicated he will veto the modest tax-relief bill approved by the House, and we do not have the votes to reach the two-thirds majority that it would take to override a veto. So discussion of tax relief is really academic this year. 
Aside from tax relief, the surplus gives us a chance to pay down the national debt. Less federal borrowing frees up funds for businesses and consumers, and as I indicated earlier in my remarks, that has already led to lower interest rates. Further reductions in the debt would continue that virtuous cycle. Moreover, it seems to me that we have a moral obligation to relieve our children and grandchildren of some of the burden of paying off the debt that our generation has accrued. 
Another option is to use the budget surplus for Social Security. We all recognize the huge costs that will be associated with getting back to what most people thought Social Security was supposed to be--a safe and secure account where their contributions could be deposited and where they could grow to produce a nest egg for retirement. Applying the budget surplus toward those transition costs will make it much easier to make the required changes and ensure that Social Security is there for our children and grandchildren. 
And of course, the surplus we have in the unified federal budget really exists only as a result of the surplus that Social Security generates anyway. Take Social Security out of the calculation and the federal budget would show not a surplus of $70 billion, but a deficit somewhere in the range of $30 billion. 
Mr. President, there is some merit in each of these ideas: tax relief, debt repayment, and Social Security reform. The problem is, before we can even begin the debate about which of these options is best, the budget surplus is being steadily frittered away. 
Earlier this year, Congress, at the Clinton administration's behest, dipped into the surplus, spending about $6 billion on a variety of programs. Within the next day or two, action is expected on another Clinton request to draw down the surplus by at least another $14 billion--with not a dime going to Social Security. We are talking about the President's request to spend billions of dollars of the surplus on Bosnia, embassy security, farm aid, and the Year 2000 computer problem. 
Of course, funding requirements for Bosnia and these other needs were certainly foreseeable and could have been accounted for when the President sent his budget to Congress eight months ago. After all, troops have been deployed in Bosnia since 1995, and last year, the President extended their deployment there indefinitely. The need to beef up embassy security was brought up months ago, and we have known about the Year 2000 computer problem for some time. None of these things should have come as a surprise to the White House or anyone else. 
But by failing to account for them when he submitted his original budget in February, President Clinton was able to inflate spending on other programs and claim that his budget still fell within the constraints of last year's budget agreement. Now, the President wants all of this declared emergency spending so that it does not have to be offset elsewhere in the budget. The reality is that he wants to raid the Social Security surplus to pay for these other things. 
Many Americans will ask what happened to the pledge President Clinton made in his State of the Union Address earlier this year. That was when he looked the American people squarely in the eye and said:  
I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. 
Eight months have passed, and the President has yet to send us any plan to protect Social Security. Worse yet, while publicly claiming to try to protect the surplus for Social Security, he has already been out drawing it down for other programs. The House-approved tax-relief bill that the President has criticized would use only $6.6 billion of the budget surplus for tax relief next year. That compares to the $20 billion or more of the surplus that the President wants to spend on other programs. 
If it is wrong to use part of the surplus for tax relief, is it not wrong to spend at least three times as much on government programs? It seems to me that this is just another example of the President trying to have it both ways. 
Mr. President, it is too bad we did not achieve any consensus about what to do with the budget surplus this year, because, by default, as of October 1, any surplus automatically went to reduce the national debt. If we are really serious about protecting Social Security, as to future surpluses, we should wall off the Social Security surplus so that it cannot be spent on other programs--not by the President, not by Congress. 
The Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, has one idea about how to do that. As I understand it, funds would be invested in genuine assets, not just government IOUs, under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. The money would be off-limits to Congress and the President, and when Congress and the President agree on a plan to save Social Security, it could be put to use for the purpose for which it was collected. 
In addition to protecting the Social Security surplus, in my opinion, we should provide broad-based tax relief to the American people with any other surplus. It is, after all, their hard work and their tax payments that have created the surplus we enjoy today. We ought to return any excess revenue to the people who earned it and paid it.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Utah. 
Mr. President, I rise with several of my fellow Senators in support of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. S. 1194 currently has 48 Senate and 192 House cosponsors. 
We believe that Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to obtain health care from the physician or provider of their choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans. 
It is dangerous to have the government control health care decisions in a free society. 
What is the problem addressed by this legislation? 
The problem is simply one of health care choice for seniors--a problem which has been brought to our attention by countless constituents all over America. 
As I have mentioned on the Senate floor several times, this problem was first brought to my attention in a letter I received from Mr. and Mrs. C.B. Howard of Prescott. 
Mary Ann Howard is a diabetic. The medicine she was taking was not working, and she wanted to change doctors to one who specialized in treating diabetics. 
Her doctor told her that this was not possible. Amazed, Mary Ann asked why, and her original doctor replied that, due to the regulatory and administrative burdens of the Medicare system, the specialist cannot afford to take any more Medicare patients. 
When Mary Ann--who had recently turned 65 and enrolled in Medicare--asked the specialist if she could pay for the treatment out of pocket, the specialist said no. `If I accept you as a patient, I would be accused of Medicare fraud.' 
Yes, it's true: Because of a flawed interpretation of the Medicare law, the government has barred Medicare beneficiaries from using their own money to receive treatment from the doctor of their choice. It's Medicare or no care! 
To end this unfairness, the Senate passed the Kyl amendment to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that would allow health care choice for seniors. 
But the Administration threatened to veto the entire budget over this provision, and forced the Senate-House conference committee to include a poison pill: 
In order to enter into a private contract, a physician or other provider would have to sign out of Medicare for two years. 
The two-year exclusion presents your doctor with a difficult choice: He can either treat you, his patient of 30 years, on a private contract basis, and drop his other Medicare patients for two years; or refuse to treat you in favor of his current Medicare patients. 
Over 96 percent of doctors accept some Medicare patients and would not likely be willing to impose such a hardship on their current patients. 
So your options will likely be reduced. 
To remove this `two year' limitation on patient-choice, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer and I introduced the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. 
The bill removes the two-year exclusion and ensure that any Medicare beneficiary can enter into an agreement with the provider of his or her choice for any health care service. 
In his 1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton said that all Americans `should have the right to choose the doctor they want for the care they need.' 
We could not agree more. But as of January 1 of this year, seniors no longer have this right because, as I mentioned, the President insisted last year's Balanced Budget Act be changed to effectively preclude seniors from going outside of Medicare--even if they are willing to pay for the care themselves.

I also thank Senators Hollings, Roth, Gorton, Craig, Nickles, Allard, Mack, Grassley, Bennett, Inhofe and Shelby for participating with statements for the Record.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S.1892, the judicial anti-nepotism bill. 
Section 458 of 28 U.S.C. reads: `No person shall be appointed to or employed in any office or duty in any court who is related by affinity or consanguinity within the degree of first cousin to any justice or judge of such court.' There is some debate about the interpretation of section 458. Some hold the view that the statute means what it says--no person related to a judge of a court may be appointed to that same court. But some hold a contrary view. Indeed, in a 1995 memo by Richard Shiffrin of the Office of Legal Counsel, although the OLC conceded that the statutory language appears to restrict presidential appointments to offices or duties In federal courts, the OLC argued that the statute only applies to judges hiring or appointing persons to the courts. Many scholars disagree with this view and with the other memoranda issued by the Administration. Finally, there is also disagreement as to whether section 458 applies to appointments where a judge has taken senior status is a `judge of such court.' 
For future judicial nominees, the Administration and the Senate must understand the criteria required for Article III judicial appointments. S.1892 maintains the current prohibition on relatives of judges being appointed to or employed in any job of the court, such as for example, positions as clerks and bailiffs.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy regarding a provision of the Commercial Space Act of 1998. It is my understanding that Section 202(b)(6) of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, which requires any company receiving a license to operate a remote sensing system to `notify the Secretary [of Commerce] of any agreement the licensee intends to enter with a foreign nation,' is amended by the Commercial Space Act of 1998 by inserting the words `significant or substantial' after `Secretary of any.' This is intended to limit the agreements which are reported to the Department of Commerce. As you know, the Congress has acted in the past to limit imagery of Israel. I would like to clarify that any agreement or contract permitting any imaging of Israel using commercially available, satellite-based remote sensing technology would fall under the definition of `significant or substantial.' Is this the Chairman's understanding?

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Leahy for his cooperation in allowing us to get this bill up at this time and deal with it in an expedited fashion. I will describe briefly the reason for the legislation, what it does. I will ask unanimous consent to submit further remarks for the Record. 
Under existing law, section 458 of title 28 of the U.S. Code reads: `No person shall be appointed to, or employed in, any office or duty in any court who is related by affinity or consanguinity within the degree of first cousin to any justice or judge of such court.' 
I will read the words that pertain to judges: `no person shall be appointed . . . to any court who is related . . . to any justice or judge of such court.' That language seems pretty straightforward on its face--that you can't have relations on the same court, nominated by the President or appointed by the Senate. Notwithstanding that relatively clear language, there has arisen a controversy over whether it means what I suggest it says. The administration has actually interpreted it in a way that could mean that it applies only to employees of the court, not to judges of the court themselves. 
This bill clarifies that it applies to both, which I think was both the original intent and the best public policy. I note that the issue has arisen because of the nomination of Professor Fletcher to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit, since his mother sits on the circuit currently. Frankly, most people were not aware of the statute, Madam President. But, in my view, we should not do something that is not permitted under the law. Therefore, while I acknowledge that the administration has raised a question about the interpretation of the statute, I think the statute is pretty clear. This bill makes it crystal clear that it applies to both employees of the court and judges of the court. 
In effect, what the legislation would do is to say that on the same court, like the same circuit or the same district court, you would not be able to have a father and son, two brothers, two sisters, that sort of thing. But you could have people related on different circuits or different Federal district courts. For example, you could have a brother in the Fifth Circuit and a brother in the Second Circuit. You could have two sisters serving in different circuits or different districts in the State of Maine, or of the State of Pennsylvania, or of the State of Vermont. But you would not be able to have two close relatives in the very same court. 
The public policy reasons for that are fairly obvious. When a litigant is before the court, the litigant wants to know that he or she is being treated fairly. When a relative who is that close to a judge that may have decided a case on a panel of judges is then being called upon to review the decision of that close relative, the litigant clearly is going to have a question as to whether his or her case can be treated fairly. Here is an example: A circuit court judge sits on a panel of three judges who decide against a plaintiff. That case is then given to the en banc panel of the circuit court in which the father, or the brother, or the sister of that judge is also a member of the panel; the litigant might well be a little skeptical that the brother, sister, father, or whoever it is, is going to be treating him fairly, given the fact that the question is whether or not he will overturn the decision of his brother, or his son, or whoever the relative is. 
So it is historic that we have tried to avoid that kind of conflict of interest. In most cases, it can be avoided. The kinds of situations in which this will arise are very rare. But since it has arisen in the context of this particular nominee, and since we think we can make the statute crystal clear to apply to both judges and employees, it seemed like a good thing to do. 
I have two final points. One, this does not apply to the U.S. Supreme Court. Constitutionally, we have the ability to set the criteria or qualifications for circuit and district courts, but we don't have that ability for the Supreme Court. That is fixed in the Constitution. We could not apply it there. 
Secondly, it only applies to nominations made after the effective date of the statute. For those interested in the nomination of Professor Fletcher, this statute or change would not adversely affect his nomination or confirmation by the Senate. 
With that explanation, I yield to Senator Leahy for such comment as he may want to make. I know he is in opposition to the bill.

As the Senator knows, I have raised an issue with the tritium provisions included in the fiscal year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act conference report. And I would be happy to engage in this colloquy with respect to that issue. 
As the Senator knows, the conference report provision regarding tritium states, among other things, that `the Secretary of Energy may not obligate or expend any funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise available to the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1999 to implement a final decision on the technology to be utilized for tritium production, made pursuant to section 3135 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998.' 
I am concerned that the administration will use this provision to continue to delay progress on this important program and build in a one-year delay in meeting DOD requirements.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. 
I hope the Department does submit a reprogramming request to implement the December decision. 
Is it the committee's intent to indicate in any way to the Department or other parts of the Federal Government that the committee expects DOE to defer selection of a preferred tritium source in December of this year?

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the commitment that Senator Warner and other members of the Armed Services Committee and Senator Sessions have expressed regarding this program. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that a new tritium source is implemented on schedule meeting DOD requirements. 
Again, I thank Senator Warner for his cooperation in helping to bring this matter to the floor at this time.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise at this time to express my opposition to specific language in the defense authorization conference report prohibiting the use of fiscal year 1999 funds to implement the decision of the Department of Energy regarding a production source for tritium. Specifically, the language states as follows: 
The Secretary of Energy may not obligate or expend any funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise available to the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1999 to implement a final decision on the technology to be utilized for tritium production, made pursuant to section 3135 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 . . . until October 1, 1999. 
Mr. President, anything that might delay implementation of a tritium production program ought to be of great concern to all of us. Tritium is the key to maintaining the credibility of our nuclear deterrent. Without a reliable source of tritium, our nuclear forces could become impotent, thereby undermining the very essence of a deterrent that has kept the peace for more than 40 years. 
Mr. President, for the benefit of those who are not as familiar with the program, tritium is a gas that is injected into a nuclear warhead to boost its yield. Once it is produced, however, tritium begins to decay at a rate of approximately 5 percent per year, therefore it must be replenished constantly. 
The United States has not produced tritium since 1988 when the Bush administration made the decision to shut down the K-reactor at the Savannah River site. Since that time, replenishment of tritium in the stockpile has continued only by recycling it from dismantled nuclear warheads. 
When the Bush administration made the decision to shut down the K-reactor, it immediately embarked on a new production reactor program with the purpose of identifying and selecting a new production source for tritium. 
Mr. President, I should say at this point that I have no parochial interest in what type of technology the Department of Energy selects to produce tritium. I favor only the option that will provide an assured source of tritium in the timeframe necessary to meet the requirements set by the Department of Defense. My interest in tritium dates back to the 1988 decision by the Bush administration when I was the ranking minority member of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Panel of the House Armed Services Committee. 
It is because I have no parochial interest and that I have had such a longstanding interest in ensuring a reliable source for tritium in the United States that I rise in opposition to the actions taken by the conferees in the fiscal year 1999 defense conference report. 
For 10 years, the Congress has been on record as encouraging DOE to make a decision on a tritium production source. A report issued by former Senator Sam Nunn in 1990 said: 
The committee strongly supports the acquisition of a new production reactor, believing an assured supply of tritium is the highest nuclear material priority in support of the nation's nuclear deterrent forces. 
A 1992 defense authorization report from the Senate stated: 
As long as the United States maintains a nuclear deterrent it will need a reliable supply of tritium to retain the viability of the stockpile. 
A 1995 House report stated: 
The Committee is deeply concerned about the lack of progress by the department in establishing a long term source of tritium, which is necessary to maintain the nation's nuclear deterrent. 
And section 3135 of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill required the Secretary of Energy to select a production source for tritium not later than December of this year. 
For 10 years, Congress has been on record as pushing the Department of Energy to select among all of the technologies once thought to be optimum to produce tritium. First, there was the heavy water option, then the modular, high temperature gas cooled reactor, then a triple play reactor. Even the heavy metal reactor came under consideration. The Fast Flux reactor was next, and then the commercial lightwater reactor and finally the accelerator. Now DOE is selecting between the TVA reactor option--a civilian lightwater reactor that may include irradiation services only, and building a particle accelerator at the Savannah River site. 
For ten years, Congress has pushed and pulled DOE along to make a decision on a production source for tritium. Until now. This year, inexplicably, just three months before the Secretary of Energy will make a decision Congress has been waiting for ten years to hear, the conferees decided to stop the DOE from expending or obligating any funds to implement its December decision. Why? 
I certainly do not intend to criticize any individual Senator on the Armed Services Committee. Certainly they have all acted with deep concern for the national security of the United States. Senator Bob Smith, the chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over DOE nuclear matters and a strong advocate for a new production source, attempted to add $60 million to the budget line for tritium. He was thwarted for a variety of reasons. 
Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the full committee, has always fought hard to protect the interests of his state; but he has fought equally hard for the interests of all Americans in national defense matters. And Senator Warner, with whom I just had a colloquy, attempted to do his best in this regard, as well. 
So why did the Congress prohibit the Department of Energy from spending or obligating funds to implement the tritium production decision? The answer is: politics. This conference compromise, I am sad to say, is all about politics. In the House, anti-nuclear foes teamed up with Members promoting one of the options under consideration by DOE, forming a coalition that threatened to jeopardize the entire defense authorization bill. Senate conferees had to find a `compromise' just to get the bill out of the conference committee. And the only compromise the House would agree to was calculated to allow advocates for the losing production option to challenge the Secretary's decision for a year, in effect, without prejudice. 
I would be remiss in my duty if I did not express my strong opposition to this language, because I believe it is tragic that a matter of this magnitude--literally going to the viability of our strategic stockpile--might be influenced by parochial interests. 
I can assure my colleagues that one of my top priorities from this point forward will be to ensure that the Department of Energy selects a tritium production source, that the Department requests adequate funds to implement its decision in fiscal year 2000 and beyond, and that the Department be allowed, indeed required, to proceed with the production of tritium without hometown politics or anti-nuke groups stopping it or slowing it down. 
Force level requirements will dictate when the United States needs tritium. If START I levels are maintained, the United States may need tritium as early as 2005. Since it will take several years to complete TVA's Belefonte reactor or to build an accelerator, two of the options, we are already bumping up against the deadline to begin producing tritium for the active stockpile. We already know that tritium will not be available for the inactive stockpile. That means if there's a crisis, the United States will not be able to bring the inactive stockpile into the inventory. 
Many hope that the United States and Russia will reduce their strategic forces to START II levels; however, there is no evidence that the Duma in Russia is inclined to ratify START II. And, U.S. law prohibits U.S. forces from being reduced beyond START I levels until START II enters into force. The Resolution of Ratification for the Start II Treaty states, `The START II Treaty shall be binding on the United States until such time as the Duma of the Russian Federation has acted pursuant to its constitutional responsibilities.' At the START II level, the United States must make a decision on a tritium production source without delay. 
So, I support the requirement that Secretary Richardson make that decision this December, and I pledge to work as hard as I can to ensure that the decision is carried through to the actual timely production of tritium. I urge my colleagues, including those in the House, to put the nation's interests first, and support a timely implementation of a tritium production facility decision. 
I appreciate that the majority leader will make a strong statement tomorrow making clear his commitment to provide the leadership to ensure the achievement of that goal. And, the colloquy with Senator Warner and Senator Smith of the Armed Services Committee and Senator Sessions should make it clear that the Senate leaders on this issue are all strongly committed to seeing that the DOE follow up the Secretary's Decision with everything necessary to meet our tritium production requirements. 
With these assurances strongly asserted here today, I am hopeful the congressional majority will hereafter present a united front, leaving no doubt that the administration must move with dispatch to implement the tritium production decision. As a result, I will support the conference report.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I first commend the Senator from Virginia for his eloquent remarks, highlighting the result of the very important hearing yesterday before the Senate Armed Services Committee and calling all of us to the challenge of providing the adequate resources necessary for our armed services to carry out their mission in the defense of the security interests of the United States of America. It was an eloquent statement, and I think it is something that all of us need to take to heart. 
Again, I want to thank Senator Warner for his efforts, largely I suspect unappreciated, because they are behind the scenes to deal with all of the myriad of problems in putting together a defense conference report and assisting the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, and working with our House colleagues as well. The colloquy that we had a moment ago was, in significant respect, to the result of his efforts. And I appreciate that.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, Senator Feinstein and I have been granted time in this period of morning business to discuss a matter that we began working on about 2 1/2 years ago, and we wanted to give a report to you, to the Members of the U.S. Senate, and, frankly, to all Americans who are interested in the subject of victims' rights. 
In April of 1996, during National Victims' Rights Week, along with Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, we introduced a Federal constitutional amendment to guarantee certain rights, fundamental constitutional rights, to all victims of violent crime. Since that time, we have worked with victims' rights groups across the country, with law enforcement officials, with our colleagues in the House of Representatives and here in the Senate, of course, with the Department of Justice, the Attorney General, and even the President of the United States, to craft an amendment that could gain acceptance in the two legislative bodies, and then be adopted by the people of the United States as an amendment to the Constitution. We have come a long way since that time. 
I want to take this time to join with Senator Feinstein in giving a brief report about our progress, with the conclusion that we are not going to be presenting this amendment at this late date in this session of the Congress, but that we do hope to have a vote on this amendment in the U.S. Senate early next year. 
I want to begin by thanking my colleague, Senator Feinstein from California. She has been an extraordinarily important proponent of crime victims' rights around the country; therefore, it was important for her to be one of the prime sponsors of this constitutional amendment. Her experience brought to bear on the subject made it much easier for people to join with us in the effort, and the work she had done with victims' rights groups before we introduced the amendment was important in galvanizing the support of those groups around the country to support this amendment and to work on the versions of it as we had to hone the language to meet the objections and concerns of various people around the country. I want to thank her also for her patience in working with me and her willingness to spend many, many long hours in working out the details of this amendment and meeting with various groups, trying to gather support among both the outside groups and our colleagues that would guarantee passage of the amendment. 
In the final version that passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in July of this year by a bipartisan vote of 11-6, we had sponsorship by 30 Republicans and 12 Democrats. You can see by this bipartisan vote of 11-6 it required cooperation of Republicans and Democrats to move this matter forward. So there is nothing partisan about the matter of victims' rights. 
I mentioned the fact that we had over 60 drafts of this amendment. What that demonstrates I think is that Senator Feinstein and I have been willing to meet with anyone at any time to hear their concerns, and objections in some cases, about what we are trying to do in specifics. We have been able to mold an amendment which meets their concerns to the extent that we have this strong, strong support. 
I note that in a brand new publication from the Department of Justice called `New Directions From the Field: Victims' Rights and Services for the 21st Century,' hot off the press, the very first recommendation of this report from the Department of Justice is that victims' rights should be embodied in an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
I would like to read from this report for a moment, if I might, because this is recommendation from the field No. 1. 
The United States Constitution should be amended to guarantee fundamental rights for victims of crime. 
What are these rights? They are the same ones that Senator Feinstein and I propose in our amendment. 
Constitutionally protected rights should include the right to notice of public court proceedings and to attend them; to make a statement to the court about bail, sentencing, and accepting a plea; to be told about, to attend, and to speak at parole hearings; to notice when the defendant or convict escapes, is released, or dies; to an order of restitution from the convicted offender; to a disposition free from unreasonable delay; to consideration for the safety of the victim in determining any release from custody; to notice of these rights; and to standing to enforce them. 
I would like to read on from this report the reasons stated for the conclusion that we need a Federal constitutional amendment, because these reasons summarize a great deal of testimony that we heard in the hearings we held which demonstrated that mere State statutes, or State constitutional provisions, are not adequate to provide a uniform floor of rights for all victims of serious crime in the United States. 
Here is what this report goes on to say: 
A federal constitutional amendment for victims' rights is needed for many different reasons, including: (1) to establish a consistent `floor of rights' for crime victims in every state and at the federal level; (2) to ensure that courts engage in a careful and conscientious balancing of the rights of victims and defendants; (3) to guarantee crime victims the opportunity to participate in proceedings related to crimes against them; and (4) to enhance the participation of victims in the criminal justice process. 
The report goes on to say: 
A victims' rights constitutional amendment is the only legal measure strong enough to rectify the current inconsistencies in victims' rights laws that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction on the state and federal levels. Such an amendment would ensure that rights for victims are on the same level as the fundamental rights of accused and convicted offenders. Most supporters believe that it is the only legal measure strong enough to ensure that the rights of victims are fully enforced across the country. They also believe, however, that the efforts to secure passage of a federal constitutional amendment for crime victims' rights should not supplant legislative initiatives at the state and federal level. 
Granting victims of crime the ability to participate in the justice system is exactly the type of participatory right the Constitution is designed to protect and has been amended to permanently ensure. Such rights include the right to vote on an equal basis and the right to be heard when the government deprives one of life, liberty, or property. 
Madam President, hot off the press from the Department of Justice, the No. 1 recommendation is a Federal constitutional amendment to do the things that the amendment which Senator Feinstein and I have introduced would do for crime victims around this country. 
I know Senator Feinstein is going to talk for a moment about how the scales of justice are imbalanced, and what our amendment is intended to do is right that imbalance between the legitimate rights of the accused on the one hand and the legitimate rights of victims on the other hand. 
Let me get to the bottom line for those who have been wondering what the status of this amendment is and where we are going to go from here. 
In July, as I said, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed out on a bipartisan basis, 11 to 6, the latest version of the amendment that Senator Feinstein and I have proposed. As noted, it has some 42 cosponsors. Since that time, we have sought to obtain floor time to debate and eventually vote on our constitutional amendment. 
Madam President, as you are aware, it has been very difficult, in the waning weeks of this congressional session, to get floor time to take up even the most mundane of bills, because the Senate is very much concentrated on getting the appropriations bills passed so that we can fund the Government for the next year. And, of course, with the campaign coming up, leaders are very definitely committed to an adjournment date of around October 9 or 10. 
Senator Feinstein and I conferred with the various leaders of the victims' rights movement and with our colleagues to determine what the best course of action would be. We understood that for something as important as amending the Constitution, we wanted to do it right. The last thing that Senator Feinstein or I would ever do is to try to hurry an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, to try to push this through without an adequate debate, without giving everyone an opportunity to have their say. 
As I said, we have made changes to the extent of 62 different drafts, which I think establish our bona fides in wanting to hear from everyone with an interest in this important subject. 
We determined, under the circumstances, rather than trying to amend another piece of legislation with our amendment or to try to rush this through in some way, that we would continue to work at the grassroots level with organizations that support the amendment, continue to work with the administration, whose support for an amendment has been very helpful, and continue to work with our colleagues to gain even more support in terms of cosponsorship, so that when we do bring it to the floor, we will have had the widest possible discussion and opportunity for everyone to participate. We understand that will make it more likely that this important effort will have quick success in the House of Representatives and, importantly, in the State legislatures, which would then have to ratify the amendment. 
Madam President, we decided that under the circumstances it was better for us not to try to rush that amendment to the floor here in the waning days, literally, of this Congress, but that we would be willing to defer action until early next year. I know that both Senator Feinstein and I would like to see this matter dealt with perhaps during Crime Victims Week in April of next year. 
But whatever the timing that is appropriate, we will be urging our colleagues early in the year to join us in cosponsoring the amendment in its final version and ensuring quick passage out of the Judiciary Committee, again because, of course, we will be in a new Congress and we will need to act anew on the legislation because of that and to secure the support of the leadership to quickly bring the amendment then to the floor of the Senate so that we can have a thorough debate and, hopefully, to pass the amendment out, sending it to the House for its subsequent action. 
We hope that with that kind of a timetable, with that kind of an opportunity for everybody to participate, we will in the year 1999 have adopted a constitutional amendment that can then be acted upon by the States once and for all to protect the rights of crime victims around this country. 
I want to close these brief remarks by again thanking Senator Feinstein and all of the others who have been so active in this effort. The outside groups I will name at another occasion, because they deserve very special recognition for all of the effort that they have put into this. 
But, frankly, the amendment would not have gotten to this point without the strong and active support of one of the strongest supporters of victims' rights that I know in the United States, my friend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. 
At this point, I would be happy to yield for her to make comments.

Mr. KYL. Might I just interrupt the Senator to also note that, as supporters of the amendment, we have the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and also, as I indicated earlier, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Hyde. So this amendment certainly has the support of the people who have been in the leadership of the committee as well as the current leadership of the committee.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me just add some additional thanks to those that Senator Feinstein has indicated here. Before I do, I note the illustrative chart that Senator Feinstein has been referring to refers to the rights of the defendants there. I think it is instructive that for those who say we should not be providing victims' rights by amending the U.S. Constitution, it is very instructive that most of those rights for defendants were added by amendment to the U.S. Constitution. They were not embodied in the original text of the Constitution. So, as times changed and as we determined that rights needed to be added, we did that for the defendants. Now, as Senator Feinstein has pointed out, it is time to add some coequal rights for victims of violent crime. 
There are some additional people I think we would be remiss in not thanking at this time. Laurence Tribe certainly was mentioned by Senator Feinstein; Professor Paul Cassell at the University of Utah was equally helpful to us, in drafting language changes.

Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Feinstein. I might add, anyone 
interested in obtaining more information about what we are doing, and in getting information about the specific provisions, the testimony of the witnesses who answered a lot of the questions that, frankly, our colleagues had, they can contact us. We can provide them transcripts of the hearings, very erudite writings of the people like Laurence Tribe and Paul Cassell who have been working for a long period of time and have so much to contribute, as well as information from people at the Department of Justice and others. 
I would also like to thank Steve Twist, an attorney in Arizona, who has spent thousands of hours pro bono, a lawyer who has spent much of his career in advancing the cause of victims' rights and who, frankly, was one of my mentors in learning about this subject and who has also helped us throughout this process. 
Also, there are two particular brilliant lawyers on our staff who deserve a lot of credit, Neil Quinter, a member of Senator Feinstein's staff with her today, and Stephen Higgins, a member of my staff; both lawyers who have spent far more than the usual amount of time on a piece of legislation, working this, because not only is it a very interesting legal challenge but also a personal commitment on their parts as much as it is for us. 
I indicated we would probably thank a lot of people at another time. Certainly the victims' rights groups and representatives who have been so important in advancing this cause at the grassroots level. But I thought it important, at least at this time as we wind up this session, to note the people who have, professionally, been so helpful to us. We will be working on this over the next 2 or 3 months as we prepare for the next legislative session. 
I will allow Senator Feinstein to close. I am pleased to announce that while we have not been able to get this amendment to the floor for consideration by our colleagues today, or this year, I am quite optimistic we will be able to do that early in the next session of the Senate. I think the additional time we take to allow everyone to have their say, to ask the questions they need to ask, that will allow this to come at a time when we can have a full debate, that that will permit us to adopt this amendment next session and send it to the States for ratification. 
Again, I thank Senator Feinstein for her wonderful cooperation and inspiration on this amendment.

Again, we cannot possibly thank everyone here today, but one of the organizations--now that Senator Feinstein mentions a couple of other people--Mothers Against Drunk Driving have been enormously helpful at the grassroots, working with our colleagues gaining cosponsorships. I would be remiss if I did not mention them. 
Again, we will have many more opportunities to discuss this. I urge anyone who has questions about it to be in touch with us. But it is certainly an effort that I am going to be pleased to work on in the next session.

Members are encouraged to come to the floor to discuss the important issue of Internet tax. 
At 3:30 p.m., under the previous order, the Senate will resume consideration of the so-called Vacancies Act for debate only until 5:30 p.m. Following that debate, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the vacancies bill. Therefore, the first vote of today's session will occur at 5:30 p.m. Following that vote, the Senate may consider any other legislative or executive items cleared for action. Members are reminded that second-degree amendments to the vacancies bill must be filed by 4:30 p.m. today. 
Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senators Feinstein and Kyl control the time during morning business from 12:45 until 1:30 p.m.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. 
The key point here is to simply hold the attorney responsible for the costs of a hearing. That is all we are talking about. It is either going to be the attorney or it is going to be the people who are owed money in a bankruptcy, or even the debtor, to be responsible for the costs of that hearing in the event the attorney has made a wrong filing here, a filing that was not substantially justified. So, if the attorney can establish that what he did was substantially justified in putting his client into chapter 13 bankruptcy as opposed to chapter 7, then he has no responsibility here and would have no liability for the costs of the hearing. But if it turns out that he was not substantially justified in doing that, then this would permit the court to assess the cost of bringing the motion and having the hearing against that lawyer. That is all we are talking about here. 
In view of the fact that the National Bankruptcy Commission has been very concerned about these bankruptcy mills, this is a legitimate concern and a way to avoid this kind of mistake from occurring. It puts the responsibility where the responsibility ought to lie. I support the position of the Senator from Iowa in urging opposition to the Feingold amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch, to introduce this joint resolution, which passed the House of Representatives last Tuesday by a vote of 310-93. 
It has been endorsed by the administration's drug czar, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, and is part of our legislative response to the recent and significant increases in drug use, especially among our young people. It is this subject to which Senator Grassley spoke earlier this afternoon. 
Before I explain what this resolution is about, let me explain how it came about. In March of this year, Senator Grassley and I convened an antidrug legalization roundtable. Attendees included Bill Bennett, Senator Mack, and 21 other people representing the Drug Czar's Office, civic groups, family groups and law enforcement officials. At that meeting, we learned about efforts all across the country to legalize drugs, including marijuana and other Schedule I drugs. Schedule I drugs include things not only like marijuana but LSD and heroin. 
The groups asked why Congress, which, after all, enacts Federal drug laws, and the administration, which enforces Federal drug laws, have been relatively silent in the face of these ever bolder attempts to legalize drugs around the country. They urged us to step up to the plate and exert some leadership. They were correct in that request. 
This joint resolution is but one step in the effort to demonstrate to our youth that the U.S. Congress strongly opposes drug abuse and efforts to legalize drugs. This resolution, I believe, will help send a very clear message that so long as marijuana, heroin, LSD, and others remain Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, that Federal law should not be altered through adoption of statewide ballot propositions that would legalize these drugs. 
Consider these statistics relating to drug use, especially among children: Marijuana use has more than doubled nationally since 1991. Heroin usage for 8th and 12th graders has more than doubled in the last 5 years. A 1997 survey by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University showed that 500,000 8th graders began using marijuana in the 6th and 7th grades. Even more alarming are the statistics in my own State of Arizona, where one out of six youths has used illegal drugs within the past month. This is one-third higher than the national average. Over 13 percent of Arizona children between the ages of 12 and 17 said they have used marijuana in the past month. Almost 17 percent admitted to having used any illicit drug, including cocaine, heroin, or inhalants, according to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. 
Attempts to legalize drugs by way of State ballot initiatives inhibits us from getting drugs out of our schools, out of our workplaces, and out of our communities. 
How can we expect our children to resist the lure of drugs if harmful drugs like marijuana are legalized under the guise of medicinal use, even though the FDA has not approved those drugs for medicinal use? How can we expect to have safe, drug-free workplaces if employees can smoke marijuana on the job, claiming it is medicine? How can we expect to have successful drug treatment programs if someone can light up a joint during a joint discussion, claiming marijuana is, after all, medicine? 
In my own State of Arizona, the voters passed a ballot initiative, Proposition 200, in 1996 which legalized all Schedule I drugs for medicinal purposes. These would include marijuana, heroin, LSD, and all of the other Schedule I drugs. This year, there is another proposition which, if passed, will require the FDA to approve the efficacy of Schedule I drugs before they could be prescribed. That, of course, would be consistent with Federal law. I have been in strong support of that proposition. 
Over $1.5 million was spent in Arizona by the prolegalization forces in the last election, the most prominent of whom were not from Arizona. Arizona is not the only State that is now a target of drug legalization. Other States that currently have pending legalization initiatives or legislation are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York, and Washington. 
This joint resolution that we have introduced puts Congress and the administration firmly behind the existing Federal legal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs, including marijuana and all other Schedule I drugs for medicinal use. 
Under current law, marijuana, heroin, LSD, and more than a hundred other drugs are classified as Schedule I because they have a high potential for abuse and lack any current accepted medical use. 
Federal law [Controlled Substances Act] prohibits Schedule I drugs from being manufactured, distributed, or dispensed. This resolution re-affirms the law. It says that before any drug can be approved as a medication, it must meet extensive scientific and medical standards established by the FDA to ensure it is safe and effective. Marijuana and other Schedule I drugs have not been approved by the FDA to treat any disease or condition, though studies are being conducted to determine if there is any potentially appropriate treatment using marijuana. Attempts to legalize drugs fly in the face of established procedures for approving the safety and efficacy of drugs. Most important, legalization sends the wrong message to youth about the health and safety risks of using drugs. 
I have joined with Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and my colleagues in the House, Representative McCollum and Representative Cox in introducing this resolution because I believe we must reassert leadership in this area. 
I am particularly pleased that the administration supports this resolution, and I would just like to take a moment to single out General McCaffrey for the good work that he has done in improving the nation's drug-control policy. 
I would urge my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation and send it to the President for his prompt signature.

Mr. KYL. That is correct. Under the Controlled Substances Act, which governs how we deal with all drugs in this country, no Schedule I drug may be prescribed as a medicine. Schedule I drugs are placed in this category because they have no recognized medical use and have a high potential for abuse. These drugs are illegal because they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.

Mr. KYL. That is correct. Many of these laws are on the books because at one time anybody could market any product to the public and call it a drug. Those were the days of snake oil salesmen who made the wildest claims for their products. They, of course, called their products `medicine' and sold them as cure-alls for every possible ailment. In many cases, in the early years of this century, those products contained large quantities of alcohol, opiates or cocaine. As a result, this country experienced a major drug epidemic centered largely on women and children who mostly used these products. None of the products were subject to regulation, they did not treat any diseases, there were no cures, but they did create a lot of addicts. Later, in response to this situation, Congress passed laws regulating these products to ensure that the public was not the victim of bad medicine, false claims, and snake oil.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, about a month ago, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts released figures on nationwide bankruptcy filings for the 12-month period ending June 30. The figures clearly illustrate what has so many of us concerned--that is, that bankruptcy filings are becoming epidemic. 
Filings for the 12-month period ending on June 30 totaled 1,429,451--an all-time high. Personal bankruptcy filings increased 9.2 percent from the same period in 1997. 
Unlike other kinds of epidemics, this is one that can be avoided in many instances if credit is used wisely and people do not overextend themselves in the first place. 
Certainly, extraordinary circumstances can strike any family, which is why it is important to preserve access to bankruptcy relief. No one disputes that there should be an opportunity to seek relief and a fresh start when truly extraordinary circumstances strike--for example, when families are torn apart by divorce or ill health. I suspect that creditors are more than willing to work with someone when such tragedy strikes to help them through tough times. 
But there is growing evidence, Madam President, that more and more people who file for relief under Chapter 7 actually have the ability to pay back some, or even all, of what they owe. It is cases like that, where bankruptcy is becoming the option of first resort, rather than last resort, that led to the drafting of the bill before us today. 
The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 1301, is the product of a number of hearings and months of deliberations. I would note that it enjoys broad bipartisan support, having been approved overwhelmingly by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a vote of 15 to 2. Similar bipartisan legislation in the House passed on June 10 by the lopsided vote of 306 to 118. 
So what does this legislation do? Those with low incomes would continue to choose between Chapter 13 payment plans and Chapter 7 discharges, just as they do today. But to ensure that some people are not abusing the system, the bill requires bankruptcy courts to consider whether people who have higher incomes and the ability to pay a portion of their debt should be required to repay what they can under Chapter 13. 
As it stands today, people with more modest incomes who live within their means are forced to subsidize wealthier individuals who abuse the bankruptcy laws. That is just not fair. 
When people run up debts they have no intention of paying, they shift a greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working families in America. Estimates are that bankruptcy costs every American family an extra $400 a year. 
Madam President, I want to stop at this point and single out three provisions of the bill for comment--provisions that were added in committee as a result of the adoption of amendments I offered. They represent what, in my view, are very modest, common-sense reforms of the bankruptcy system. 
The first appears in Section 314 of the bill and provides that debts that are fraudulently incurred could no longer be discharged in Chapter 13, the same as in Chapter 7. Currently, at the conclusion of a Chapter 13 plan, the debtor is eligible for a broader discharge than is available in Chapter 7, and this superdischarge can result in several types of debts, including those for fraud and intentional torts, being discharged whereas they could not be discharged in Chapter 7. My amendment would simply add fraudulent debts to the list of debts that are nondischargeable under Chapter 13. It is as simple as that. 
Let me take a few moments to share some of the comments that others have made on the subject. Here is what the Deputy Associate Attorney General, Francis M. Allegra, said about the dischargeability of fraudulent debts in a letter dated June 19, 1997: `We are unconvinced that providing a (fresh start) under Chapter 13 superdischarge to those who commit fraud or whose debts result from other forms of misconduct is desirable as a policy matter.' 
Here is what Judge Edith Jones of Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said in a dissenting opinion to the report of the Bankruptcy Review Commission: `The superdischarge satisfies no justifiable social policy and only encourages the use of Chapter 13 by embezzlers, felons, and tax dodgers.' 
Judith Starr, the Assistant Chief of the Litigation Counsel Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on March 18, 1998. Speaking about the fraud issue, she said: `We believe that, in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, Congress never intended to extend the privilege of the `fresh start' to those who lie, cheat, and steal from the public.' She goes on to say:  
A fair consumer bankruptcy system should help honest but unfortunate debtors get their financial affairs back in order by providing benefits and protections that will help the honest to the exclusion of the dishonest, and not vice versa. It is an anomaly of the current system that bankruptcy is often more attractive to persons who commit fraud than to their innocent victims. Bankruptcy should not be a refuge for those who have committed intentional wrongs, nor should it encourage gamesmanship by failing to provide real consequences for abuse of its protections. 
And she concludes: 
We support [the provision of the House bill] which makes fraud debts nondischargeable in Chapter 13 cases. Inducements to file under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 should be aimed at honest debtors, not at those who have committed fraud. 
A final quotation: The Honorable Heidi Heitkamp, the Attorney General of North Dakota, testified to the following before the House Committee on March 10: 
When a true `bad actor' is in the picture--a scam artist, a fraudulent telemarketer, a polluter who stubbornly refuses to clean up the mess he has created there is a real potential for bankruptcy to become a serious impediment to protecting our citizenry. 
Furthermore, she says: 
We must all be concerned because bankruptcy is, in many ways, a challenge to the normal structure of a civilized society. The economy functions based on the assumption that debts will be paid, that laws will be obeyed, that order to incur costs to comply with statutory obligations will be complied with, and that monetary penalties for failure to comply will apply and will `sting.' If those norms can be ignored with impunity, and with little or no future consequences for the debtor, this bodes poorly for the ability of society to continue to enforce those requirements. 
Madam President, I hope there will be no dissent to these anti-fraud provisions. Certainly, there should not be. Bankruptcy relief should be available to people who work hard and play by rules, yet fall unexpectedly upon hard times. Perpetrators of fraud should not be allowed to find safe haven in the bankruptcy law. 
The second amendment I offered, and which has been incorporated into this bill, is found in Section 315. It, too, is simple and straight-forward. It says that debts that are incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts are themselves non-dischargeable. In other words, if someone borrows money to pay a debt that cannot be erased in bankruptcy, that new debt could not be erased either. The idea is to prevent unscrupulous individuals from gaming the system and obtaining a discharge of debt that would otherwise be non-dischargeable. 
I want to emphasize that we have taken special care to ensure that debts incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts will not compete with non-dischargeable child- or family-support in a post-bankruptcy environment. 
The third amendment of mine adopted in committee is reflected in Section 316 of the bill, and it is intended to discourage people from running up large debts on the eve of bankruptcy, particularly when they have no ability or intention of making good on their obligations. 
Current law effectively gives unscrupulous individuals a green light to run their credit cards just before filing for bankruptcy, knowing they will never be liable for the charges they are incurring. That is wrong, and it has got to stop. 
The provision would establish a presumption that consumer debt run up on the eve of bankruptcy would be non-dischargeable. The provision is not self-executing. In other words, it would still require that a lawsuit be brought by the creditor against the debtor. Many valid claims for nondischargeability are never filed, because the creditors do not have enough money at stake to justify the litigation costs. But if this provision achieves the intended purpose, debtors will not only minimize the run-up of additional debt, they will have more money available after bankruptcy to pay priority obligations, including alimony and child support. 
Again, special care has been taken to ensure that we are only talking about debts incurred within 90 days of bankruptcy for goods or services that are not necessary for the maintenance or support of the debtor or dependent child. We want to be sure that family obligations are met. 
Madam President, I want to discuss one other aspect of the bill before closing, and that relates to the many provisions that Senators Hatch, Grassley, and I crafted to protect the interests of women and children.

Mr. KYL. Even though current law is clear--and even though the original version of the bill made no change in the protections that it provides--concerns were expressed that provisions of the legislation might indirectly or even inadvertently affect ex-spouses and children of divorce. Assuming that critics were operating in good faith--and because our intent was always to ensure that family obligations were met first--Senators Hatch, Grassley, and I crafted an amendment to remove any doubt whatsoever about whether women and children come first. 
The Hatch-Grassley-Kyl amendment elevates the priority of child-support from its current number seven on the priority list for purposes of payment to number one--ahead of six other items, including lawyer's fees that are now afforded higher priority. Our amendment mandates--mandates--that all child support and alimony be paid before all other obligations in a Chapter 13 plan. It conditions both confirmation and discharge of a Chapter 13 plan upon complete payment of all child support and alimony that is due before and after the bankruptcy petition is filed. It helps women and children reach exempt property and collect support payments notwithstanding contrary federal or state law. It exempts state child-support collection authority from the automatic stay under bankruptcy law to ensure prompt collection of child-support payments. And it extends the protection accorded an ex-spouse by making almost all obligations one ex-spouse owes to the other non-dischargeable. 
Despite the various protections we have laid out, I know that some will still contend that child-support and alimony could be placed in competition with other debts that are made non-dischargeable by other provisions of the bill. But if placing more debt into the non-dischargeable category were really harmful to the interests of women and children, critics would also object to an amendment that Senator Torricelli offered in the Judiciary Committee--an amendment that added tort judgments for intentional torts causing personal injury or death to the list of non-dischargeable debts. But the Torricelli amendment passed without objection in committee. As a society, we have decided that people who do harm to others should be held accountable for their actions. Senator Torricelli's amendment will do that, and I support it. 
Let us keep several points in mind about the debts that are made non-dischargeable by the bill. First, even though they are made non-dischargeable, they are given a lower priority for payment than child support and alimony. The Hatch-Grassley-Kyl amendment makes that crystal clear. 
Second, the debts made newly non-dischargeable by the bill include debts incurred by fraud, debts run up on the eve of bankruptcy by those with no intention or no ability of paying, and debts that are incurred to pay otherwise non-dischargeable debts. We are talking about abusive use of credit. Are those who still contend we have not gone far enough really suggesting that individuals who engage in fraud and other abusive credit practices should be allowed to have those debts erased or otherwise sanctioned by the bankruptcy code? I hope not. 
When people run up debts they have no intention of paying--when people are allowed to walk away from fraud and other harm caused to others--they shift a greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working families in America, including those that depend on child support to make ends meet. As I indicated at the beginning of my remarks, estimates are that bankruptcy costs every American family an extra $400 a year. Bankruptcy reform can reduce that burden.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday, I led an effort during consideration of the FY99 foreign operations appropriations bill to tighten the conditions under which additional funding is made available to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Although the bill included provisions to prod the IMF into making badly needed reforms of its operations, it stopped short of actually requiring the implementation of those reforms. Instead, it merely conditioned the release of funds on the IMF making a public commitment to reform. That, in my view, was not good enough. 
The IMF has not effectively used the funds that have been allocated to it in the past. According to Johns Hopkins University economist, Steve Hanke, few nations have actually graduated from IMF emergency loans. Most have stayed on the dole for years on end. One study found that, of the 137 mostly developing countries from 1965 to 1995, less than a third graduated from IMF loan programs. 
The Heritage Foundation has found that, of the IMF's borrowers during 1965 to 1995, no more than half were better off than when they started the loan programs. Almost all were actually poorer, and almost all were deeper in debt. 
The IMF's failures are apparent even today. Just a few months ago, the IMF orchestrated a $22.6 billion bailout package for Russia, yet that country's economy shows no signs of improving. In fact, it is growing worse every day. And all of the experts agree that, unless Russia establishes the kind of rules of law required for a functioning economy, all the money in the world will not help it. We would be fooling ourselves to think otherwise. 
Although my amendment failed on a vote of 74 to 19, I am heartened by two things. First, we won more votes for effective IMF reform yesterday than we did when the question was first put to the Senate back in March. And second, the issue is far from settled in the House, which has been more skeptical of providing the IMF with any additional resources. In other words, this issue is far from settled, and my hope is that the final version of the foreign operations bill will either include the more effective reforms I have proposed, or will scale back IMF funding altogether.  
FY99 FOREIGN AID SPENDING 
Mr. President, pending a final resolution of the IMF issue, I think it is important to consider what else is accomplished by this bill, because there are some very good things about it. First, I would note that the cost of the bill, aside from the IMF, is nearly $600 million, or 4.5 percent, less than last year's measure. That is significant. 
Second, this bill contains $2.94 billion in aid to Israel: $1.08 billion in economic assistance and $1.86 billion in military assistance. I would note that this amount is $60 million less than was appropriated for Israel last year, and it is consistent with the United States' agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to phase out U.S. economic assistance to Israel over ten years. These funds are crucial to ensuring that Israel's economic and security concerns continue to be adequately addressed. 
The level of support for Israel that is contained in this bill sends a clear message to the people of Israel and the world that the world's greatest democracy remains committed to supporting the only democracy in the Middle East, a critical ally that supports American values and interests in a critical region. 
Third, the bill contains other provisions that I believe will serve to protect our values and interests in the Middle East. For example, the bill makes clear that the Palestine Broadcasting Corporation is an organization that restricts fundamental press freedoms and broadcasts material that is inimical to U.S. interests, and is therefore unworthy of U.S. assistance. 
Fourth, the legislation includes an amendment offered by the Majority Leader--an amendment I cosponsored--that will provide $10 million to support the Iraqi opposition. Saddam Hussein's recent decision to halt all cooperation with U.N. arms inspections and recent revelations that Iraq had developed the capability to load deadly VX nerve gas in missile warheads is a reminder of the continuing threat posed by this rogue regime to U.S. forces and friends in the region. The additional funding in this bill is intended to reinvigorate the Iraqi opposition as part of an overarching strategy that is aimed at replacing the current government in Iraq. 
Fifth, the bill provides clear and strong support for the Agency for International Development's efforts to ensure that the countries of the former Soviet Union develop effective legal systems capable of addressing the many challenges facing these states as they continue to build stable democratic societies. One area of particular concern is the troubling amount of domestic violence in Russia. This bill makes clear that the active support of women's crisis centers in Russia should be a priority. 
Additionally, the bill makes clear that no funds should be provided to Russia if the government of Russia implements any statute, executive order, or regulation that would discriminate against religious groups or communities in Russia. 
Sixth, I am pleased that this bill conditions assistance to Russia on Moscow's termination of financial and technical support for Iran's nuclear program. Iran's ongoing efforts to acquire nuclear weapons are a threat to our security; it would be the height of irresponsibility to send American taxpayers' dollars to a country that is assisting a rogue state such as Iran in developing these dangerous weapons. 
Along similar lines, the bill wisely restricts aid to North Korea unless the President can certify that it has ceased its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and that it has also stopped assisting the ballistic missile programs of states that support terrorism. 
Seventh, the bill takes steps to ensure that American interests in Central Asia are protected. In the next few years, a massive pipeline will be built to transport the vast oil and natural gas resources of the Caspian Sea region to the Mediterranean sea for export to the West. The bill states that an East-West pipeline that travels through Turkey--as opposed to a Northern pipeline through unstable regions of Russia--will provide a secure energy transport system that will support stability and democracy in the region. 
CONCLUSION 
Mr. President, given that the IMF issue has yet to be resolved--House approval is tenuous at best--I ultimately based my vote on the initial version of the FY99 Foreign Operations bill on the balance of factors I have just discussed. Should it turn out that the IMF funding is ultimately included, particularly without a mechanism for ensuring the implementation of effective reforms of the way the international agency does business, I may well reassess my vote on the final conference report. For now, I am supporting the bill.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, the Senate passed the supplemental appropriations bill last March. Included in that bill was a provision to provide $18 billion in additional budget authority for the International Monetary Fund. That funding, as we all know, was eventually stripped out of the supplemental conference report because Members could not come to an agreement on the funding or on reforms for the IMF. 
Today, of course, we are back debating the foreign operations bill. Obviously, we are trying to develop some kind of consensus in going forward for the funding of the IMF. Unfortunately, in my view, this bill that we are debating right now does not go far enough to move the IMF toward reform, including in the areas of transparency and bankruptcy reform. It includes conditions much less restrictive than those voted out of the Appropriations Committee earlier this year. 
I support the restrictions that were developed by the Appropriations Committee. As a result, I am offering this amendment today which, while not going as far as I would like, would move the IMF closer to reform than the current provisions of the fiscal year 1999 foreign operations bill will do. 
As I said, when the Senate debated IMF reform in March, the full Senate Appropriations Committee approved, by a vote of 26-2, a series of reforms affecting IMF funding. They were not as strong as some of us would have liked. But instead of strengthening the provisions on the Senate floor, an amendment was offered to weaken them, and that amendment passed 84-16. 
Those of us who voted against the weakening amendment in March are here today again to request that the Senate vote for this amendment and require the IMF and its recipients to use the $18 billion in U.S. taxpayer-contributed funds in more open and responsible ways. 
The Kyl amendment changes only one of the reform sections included in the foreign operations bill. It does not prevent the United States from releasing funding to the IMF. The current IMF language requires the G-7 nations to publicly agree to seek policies that provide for new conditions. But seeking policies is not the same as requiring policies. 
So my provision simply returns to the Senate Appropriations Committee-passed language and states that:  
None of the funds appropriated in this Act under the heading `United States Quota, International Monetary Fund' may be obligated, transferred or made available to the International Monetary Fund until 30 days after the Secretary of the Treasury certifies that the Board of Executive Directors of the Fund have agreed by resolution that stand-by agreements or other arrangements regarding the use of Fund resources shall include provisions requiring the borrower [to agree to a set of conditions]. 
Passing an amendment that requires a commitment from the board of directors of the Fund to pass such a resolution makes more sense than just asking for a public commitment to such reforms. The IMF, by its nature, is often the antithesis of free market reform. IMF intervention often rewards negligent bankers or corrupt or incompetent governments and often does not reward individual countries that work through the private sector to get through tough times. 
So my amendment, which does not cut off funding for the IMF, would nevertheless return to a stricter version of reforms than is currently included in this bill. There is a case that some have made that IMF funding should be eliminated altogether. I will not try to make that case today, although people like Lawrence Lindsay and Allan Metzer of AEI, for example, have made a strong argument that much of the money we have contributed to the IMF has been wasted. It is true that no money has been lost yet, although Lindsay suggests that the IMF is like the FDIC in the late 1970s or early 1980s. At that time, the taxpayers had not lost any money in the FDIC either. 
If the world is ready to topple into an economic abyss, there probably is not much the IMF could do about it in any event. Its $23 billion in lending in 1997 was about a tenth of the private capital flow into developing countries alone. And in any event, there is evidence that suggests that the IMF has actually been a barrier to economic growth in poorer countries. 
According to Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke, few nations actually graduate from IMF emergency loans. Many stay on the dole for years on end. One study found of 137 mostly developing countries from 1965 to 1995, less than a third graduated from IMF loan programs. The Heritage Foundation found that of IMF borrowers from 1965 to 1995, no more than half were better off than when they started the loan programs. Almost all were actually poorer. Almost all were deeper in debt. 
So what we are trying to do with this amendment is to restore some of the conditions that will ensure that the money American taxpayers have worked hard to earn will actually serve a useful and productive purpose if contributed to the IMF. 
Clearly, the policies promoted by the IMF are important. Whether debt incurred by other nations as a result of IMF intervention is good or bad depends on the uses to which that debt is put. If it increases productive capital, income increases and the debt can be serviced from the increased wealth that is generated. If, however, borrowing is used to hold the exchange rate steady so private lenders can flee, there are no productive assets from which later interest payments can be made. 
Unfortunately, it is the latter type of policies that are typically promoted by the IMF. The IMF promotes trade barriers in order to cut current account deficits. The IMF promotes tax increases to reduce budget deficits, and currency devaluations to adjust exchange rates. The IMF long ago admitted it was not committed to free markets, explaining that `programs have accommodated such nonmarket devices as production controls, administered prices, and subsidies.' These are the kind of policies that often bring economies to a halt. 
The better policy is to promote fair and reliable bankruptcy laws, transparent and internationally accepted accounting procedures, minimal government interference in the allocation of credit, prudent oversight of banking systems, and competition among foreign and domestic banking organizations. All of these are the kind of reforms that we all agree should be pursued. 
But that is as far as the foreign operations bill before us goes. Basically, it just says this is what we ought to be doing. It does not require the implementation of these reforms in the countries that are going to receive the IMF loans. As a result, it does nothing to assure that that money will not be wasted. By contrast, my amendment would ensure that reforms are accomplished before taxpayer dollars are allocated. 
Why is it important to ensure that reform is accomplished first? In some cases, IMF programs have effectively subsidized very inefficient and even corrupt political systems. Former Secretary of State George Shultz suggested in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee earlier this year that creditors must be held accountable for their mistakes. Taxpayers should not assume the risk of bad decisions or those bad decisions will continue to be made. 
That is the sad record, unfortunately, of many of the countries that have received these IMF loans in the past. 
Bailouts effectively shield investors and politicians from the consequences of their poor economic decisions by `socializing' the risks and reducing the cost to failure associated with investment. Risks are socialized because everyone ends up paying for an individual investors' errors; the costs of failure are reduced because either directly or indirectly the IMF can compensate investors when their investments fail. IMF bailouts, as they are currently constructed, encourage investors to engage in activity they would likely avoid if there were no IMF to shield them from actions. Investors, not people or countries, are being bailed out. We should understand that when we talk about bailing out a country, that is really inaccurate. We are talking about bailing out investors. In the so-called Mexican bailout in 1995, the Mexican people suffered a sharp decline in the standard of living there, and there were large increases in unemployment and an overnight erosion of the savings. Investors, however, escaped with minimal losses. 
Lawrence Lindsay contends IMF bailouts probably make systematic contagion more likely in the long run and suggests that the best protection we have against bankers overextending themselves to imprudent borrowers is the bankers' fear of losing money. 
The amendment I am presenting today is an effort to ensure that these poor lending practices are not continuing. Virtually all of us have agreed that the IMF needs reform. In fact, we put that reform in the amendment that was adopted earlier this year to the supplemental appropriations bill. But that amendment rejected the Senate appropriations decision, which was made on a 26-2 vote, to have really meaningful reforms required--not simply pursued. That is the difference--do you try to pursue it or do you guarantee it before you give this taxpayer money. 
Let me close with the final thought about what is not at issue because of our very real concern about the state of the Russian economy now. All of the experts agree that assistance to Russia will only work if Russia makes fundamental reforms, the kind of things that would be required under my amendment. 
For example, the President in Moscow yesterday urged the Russians--quoting from a Washington Times story of today--to 
follow free market principles. 
Here is what the President said: 
Investors move in the direction of openness, fairness and freedom . . . you have to play by the rules. 
That is precisely what would be required by my amendment. 
The President said he would not give `any fresh money unless it moves decisively toward reform.' 
The article points out that IMF detractors are not proposing to withdraw money that has already been committed. I want to make that point crystal clear. We are not talking about not loaning money to the Russians, money that has already been committed. We are saying the same thing the President of the United States is telling them: You have to make a commitment to the fundamental reforms, otherwise the money is wasted and we both lose. 
Mr. President, the same thing could be said of other countries in the world. These countries are not going to be denied loans if they establish the kind of rules of law required for a functioning economy. If they don't, all the money in the world will not help them anyway. That is true for Russia, as well as it is for the other countries that might be receiving IMF loans. 
In conclusion, my amendment simply restores the original committee language setting forth reasonable conditions for IMF loans. If we are unwilling to do this, then some will suggest that we are simply committing $18 billion in taxpayer funds to feel good about having done something to help countries having economic difficulties. Let's ensure that in approving our contributions to the IMF, that that money will be effectively spent. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. KYL. Thank you. I doubt that we have to take the full amount of time in completing this debate. I want to make one critical point. The Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, has just made the point that the United States cannot retreat from our international obligations or we will be sending a terrible message. I want to make it very clear that the Kyl amendment doesn't retreat at all. In fact, it moves forward. 
The Kyl amendment simply institutes the language that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee supported when the committee voted 21-1 to ensure that the money lent by the United States would be effectively spent by requiring some conditions that will work. 
Now, what the bill before us does is erase those conditions and put in some good-sounding language that isn't going to do the trick. As a matter of fact, both the lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal today, and a lead op-ed piece by David Malpass, the chief international economist at Bear Stearns, make the point that this money will not be spent effectively if we continue to follow current practices. As a matter of fact, from the latter op-ed piece, `To avoid accountability, the U.S. maintains the facade that the IMF is dealing with the crisis and that Japan is to blame for much of it.' 
Are we really going to do something about this crisis? I totally agree with my friend from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, on the nature of the problem, and I believe that we essentially agree on the solution. 
The only difference is how serious we are about implementing the solution. Here is the crux of the debate. Under the bill before us, there are two key phrases about how we are going to implement the funding, how we are going to spend the money and implement the reforms that we all agree to. 
One, we are going to seek to implement these reforms--the language is on line 2 of page 120: `and will seek to implement.' And then down on line 19, `The United States shall exert its influence with the Fund and its members to encourage' these reforms. We are going to `seek' and we are going to try to `encourage.' 
That is not going to work. It is the same old thing. 
What the Appropriations Committee voted 26 to 2 to do was to actually include the reforms. The language in my amendment says `shall include.' 
Those are the two operative phrases. That is the difference we are debating about the reforms we all agree to. The question is, Are we going to encourage these other countries that we lend the money to, to effect the reforms, or are we going to require that they shall be included in the agreement that we enter into with these countries? 
All of us agree about the nature of the problem. We are all just as committed to an international economy. We all agree on the solution--the bankruptcy reforms, the transparency. There is no disagreement about that. The only disagreement is, are we going to require it--the Kyl amendment that the Appropriations Committee voted 26 to 2 to do--or are we going to seek to encourage people to do these things? 
I submit that if all we are going to do is seek to encourage, we are going to end up in the same place as we have been, with countries spiraling downward and downward and downward. 
The President of the United States had it right when he said in Russia yesterday, to get your fair share of investment, you have to play by the rules. If that is his opinion--and I know it is, and I agree with it--`have to play by the rules' is a requirement. It is not something we are just asking them to do; it is something we are going to require them to do. It is our money we are lending to them for the good of us all. U.S. taxpayers have some right to insist that it is going to be spent wisely. We all agree that it hasn't worked in the past. The President is saying to the Russians: What you have been doing has not worked. You have to play by the rules. 
The Kyl amendment says that the agreements shall require that the reforms be included. The current bill says we will seek to implement and will exert our influence to encourage. 
On the one hand, you have a requirement; on the other hand, you have the same loose language that will allow these countries to continue to slide into economic despair because they don't have the courage or the ability to adopt the reforms, and they are not being required to do so by the Fund that is lending them the money. 
That is why I urge the adoption of the original committee language which will be much stronger and will guarantee that this money will be spent wisely. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I will just conclude with this point. 
The distinguished Senator from Delaware, for whom I have great admiration, made the point that the President may instruct our delegates to seek these reforms and, indeed, he may but we do not currently have the means to insist on them. My amendment would change that. 
The distinguished Senator from Kansas made the point that the reforms in the current bill are not patsy reforms, and, indeed, he is correct in that. As I said, we essentially all agree on the reforms. The only difference is whether they are going to be urged upon the nations to which the money is lent or they are going to be imposed as requirements on the lending of the money. That is what this amendment boils down to. Do we ensure that the reforms are included by requiring it, or do we simply seek to include them and merely encourage the borrowers to engage in the reforms that we all support? 
I think the debate is clear. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and yield back the remainder of my time, Mr. President.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, both the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, who has just spoken, and I have just come from a briefing by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the FBI, and a host of other officials involved in protecting American secrets and engaging in counterterrorism around the world. 
The Director of the Central Intelligence Agency has said that the amendment that is pending before us is woefully inadequate to protect our national security and the information that we need to keep classified in the United States. 
I wholeheartedly associate myself with the remarks of the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and want to argue in the strongest way that this amendment be defeated. It should be defeated on a 98-2 vote, frankly, because it would be an astonishing precedent-setting action of giving to foreign countries--foreign powers--power over United States classified material, power that not even U.S. citizens possess. 
It would greatly jeopardize the sources and methods for gathering intelligence that we have to employ in different parts of the world in order to get the information necessary to protect the security of the United States, all in the name of human rights, which all of us are, frankly, extraordinarily committed to protect. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who has just spoken, and I, and others, have gone to great lengths to ensure that the CIA and other American 
intelligence organizations are strictly adherent to standards for human rights and that we will help others track down human rights abuses wherever and however it is necessary. But to provide for the wholesale declassification of American secret information for Guatemalan and Honduran organizations under this amendment, as I said, is not only unprecedented, but is astonishing in its lack of concern for American security. 
I do not suggest, by any means, that the sponsors of the amendment do not deeply care about the security of the United States. But the way this amendment is written, as I said, according to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, is woefully inadequate in protecting intelligence sources and methods, and as a result will chill current and future sources from providing the CIA information, in fact, information that is essential for us to ensure the protection of human rights in the very countries for which this amendment is designed to get information. 
It ostensibly applies the same standards that are used for the declassification of documents relating to the JFK assassination. And that is the basis upon which it is argued, `Oh, well, it must be OK.' But there are a couple of key factors here, Mr. President. 
First of all, those are for Americans. This is declassification for American citizens. This is not declassification for foreign governments or foreign organizations. But of equal importance, the JFK assassination documents are--what?--40 years old. We are talking, in this amendment here, about information which is much more current. The privacy, law enforcement, and intelligence concerns are much greater in these newer documents. 
There is no reason, frankly, for the standards to be different than those set out in the President's Executive Order 12958. Otherwise, we risk jeopardizing ongoing prosecutions, we risk losing critical intelligence information, compromising sources and methods, and, frankly, releasing a lot of private information as well. 
As I said, it is astonishing to me that we would have an amendment that would literally give foreign organizations these extraordinary statutory privileges to expedite and compel declassification of U.S. national security information. And for the other reasons that the chairman pointed out--the unfunded mandate, the substantial costs associated with it, the substantial litigation costs--I am not sure if the chairman pointed that out, but the litigation costs alone could be well over 100 times greater than just the processing cost for the information itself. 
In fiscal year 1998, Congress funded a very special declassification program to review and declassify many of the documents. Since this amendment changes the standards for withholding information, the intelligence community will have to re-review the documents, and, as I said, the taxpayers have already paid for that review. 
We ought to table this amendment until we have an opportunity to fully consider its impact, the impact on the intelligence community, the Departments of State, Defense and Justice, as well as on the human rights that, frankly, would be potentially abused and the human rights concerns that we have as a result of not being able to have access to the same information or to the information that we need to protect human rights because of the implication with respect to the sources and methods that could well be degraded as a result of the passage of this amendment. 
So this is the kind of thing that ought to be considered very, very carefully, first of all, in the Select Committee on Intelligence. It has not been done. It ought to be very carefully vented through the administration. As I said, the DCI is very, very concerned about this particular amendment. It is premature at best and enormously antithetical to our intelligence collection efforts at worst. As a result, at the appropriate time I will urge my colleagues to support a motion to table this amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me make two quick points and perhaps close this debate. 
First of all, under U.S. law, families and victims of crime in the United States, Americans, have the ability to go through the State Department to get this kind of information. That provision was included in last year's intelligence bill. 
Secondly, I made the point earlier we are not as concerned about American citizens having the right to get information declassified as we are foreign organizations. What I pointed out was there are two foreign organizations that are specifically defined in the bill as being permitted, then, to have access to this information and to require the departmental procedure which would result in the declassification or at least the consideration of declassification of this information. That is what is unprecedented here. That is what would be so astonishing. 
Finally, the process here is not a simple, inexpensive process where the CIA can inject and stop it. It is an interagency group, and the CIA can be and, in fact, a majority of time where this has been used, my understanding is it has been overridden. There are private people on the panel as well as representatives from other government agencies. As a result, you are talking about an extraordinarily time-consuming and expensive operation for people who are really charged with other responsibilities. 
With respect to the American citizens, I think we have that covered. With respect to foreign powers and foreign groups, I don't think we want to give them rights in requiring declassification of materials that the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency is concerned does not adequately protect our national security needs. 
Again, I urge at the appropriate time that the motion to table be supported.

Mr. President, it seems that we would all want the military leaders of our country to agree that any policy that we adopt is commensurate with both combat requirements and the safety of the Armed Forces of the United States. And if they are not willing to certify that, then I certainly wouldn't want to be on record as supporting a policy or a treaty or a law that they felt was inimical to the safety of the Armed Forces of the United States. I guess I am really wondering what the controversy is about. Maybe there isn't much controversy.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thought I might take just a moment to speak to the issue of the policy of the United States of America toward Iraq and Saddam Hussein. 
In the month or so that the Senate has been out of session, there has been a significant series of developments which cause me considerable concern about the direction of the administration's policy--or not policies, as the case may be--and the requirements of the Senate to act in accordance. 
The President will recall that about 7 years ago the entire country was fixed on the problem of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and strongly supported the action of the President--at that time President Bush--to first engage in what was called Desert Shield and then later Desert Storm; the militarily significant rollback of the Iraqi forces in about 100 hours. I visited Saudi Arabia as that buildup of American forces was occurring. It was unprecedented really since the time of the Vietnam war. The success of the operation was one of the great successes of U.S. military history. 
I remember the parades all across America when our troops returned home. We were very proud of what we had done. We had turned back a difficult dictator who had engaged in unspeakable horrors against people in Kuwait, against the environment, and really against the rule of international law. 
We had disengaged from Iraq because the President had succeeded through the efforts of General Norman Schwarzkopf and the Secretary of Defense--at the time Richard Cheney--and Secretary of State Jim Baker to force Saddam Hussein into an agreement that would forever bar him from developing weapons of mass destruction, or the means to deliver them. That was an agreement that Saddam Hussein willingly entered into, although one could say it wasn't too willingly because we had about 500,000 troops in his country at the time. But the deal was we will stop now if you will sign this agreement; otherwise we will have to continue our military operation. Saddam Hussein wisely decided to sign an agreement with the United States. That agreement was to allow U.N. inspectors to ensure that Iraq was not developing weapons of mass destruction, and that it would destroy the stocks that it had developed. 
We know that for the first few years world attention was focused on Saddam Hussein because of what he had done. The United Nations was focused on supporting and enforcing those inspections, and the United States on a couple of occasions either took or threatened to take military action to force Saddam Hussein to comply with his part of the bargain. 
America was united in that position. Now, the Bush administration policy at the time was called a policy of containment. The effort was not to get Saddam Hussein out of power per se but, rather, to prevent him from doing any damage to neighbors. But a concomitant to that policy was to ensure that he did not have the capability of causing his neighbors problems by virtue of the U.N. inspections. 
Slowly, over time, after the Clinton administration took office, that policy evolved. Now, they continued to call it containment, but a critical component of the policy was missing --the policy that denied Saddam Hussein the ability to conduct military operations against his neighbors--because over time the administration became less and less willing to ensure that the inspection regime called for under the agreement was actually carried out. UNSCOM is the name by which we know this, the acronym of the United Nations inspection regime. And the UNSCOM inspections eventually became very big news because Saddam Hussein saw that from time to time he could thwart the inspectors, prevent them from doing their job, and cause the United States to have to build up military forces in the region. And about the time we would spend a lot of money and effort and time to get these military forces in place, then he would agree to strike some kind of a deal. And as soon as we then brought the force level back down again, he would break the deal, and we would have to do the same thing all over again. He was jerking our chain. 
This administration, however, failed to develop a strategy to deal with that. Many of us in the Senate, through meetings with members of the administration, through correspondence, and through public hearings and statements, have tried to get the administration to focus on a long-term strategy that would have as its ultimate goal not containing Saddam Hussein but eliminating Saddam Hussein. No one believes that this is easy. It is a long-term project, and it takes a real commitment. This administration has not been willing to make that commitment. 
In February of last year, the administration again built up forces because again Saddam Hussein had refused to allow the inspectors to do their job under the agreement that he had made. Many of us in the Senate were concerned that if the administration simply lobbed a few cruise missiles into certain Iraqi facilities, it would be antithetical to our long-term goal. It would not do anything to ensure that the inspectors could do their job. It would probably kill a lot of innocent people. It would turn world opinion against the United States. And we need the support of our allies, support that we used to have when the Bush administration worked to get that support. But most importantly, military action would not be in furtherance of any particular strategic policy. It would waste money, it would not achieve anything, and in the end we would still have an empty policy. 
The administration continued to insist that our policy was one of containment. But containment is no policy if, in fact, you are at the same time allowing your opponent--in this case, Iraq--to build up military forces so that when they want to strike, they have the capability of doing so. And because we don't have forces in the area sufficient to stop aggression, again, it would have to be a reaction on the part of the free world in response to aggression by Saddam Hussein rather than preventive action to begin with. 
And so as time went on, the Iraqis continued to snub their 
nose at the United Nations inspectors, probably building up the capability to produce weapons of mass destruction and also to develop the missiles, or produce the missiles to deliver those weapons. 
The inspectors then have reported back to us. Richard Butler, who heads UNSCOM right now, and others have said that if we stop those inspections, it is only a matter of time before Iraq can develop the capability of producing these missiles and either has now or could quickly develop the chemical and biological weapons that would be necessary to threaten or cause harm to their neighbors. So the inspections are a key component of any strategy, including a strategy of containment. And it does no good to have a strategy of containment if you don't enforce the inspection regime called upon by the agreement with Saddam Hussein 7 years ago. 
Recently, Scott Ritter, a well known inspector on the UNSCOM team, has resigned in protest, and the reason, Mr. President, is because he has said that U.S. officials, including the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, have thwarted the inspections by specifically putting conditions on U.S. involvement with the inspectors and by conditioning the time, the place, and manner of inspections. 
Now, this is all wrapped up in diplomatic speak. The administration has flatly denied this is true. The administration, frankly, in this respect is not telling the truth, Mr. President. If Scott Ritter is to be believed, restrictions have been placed upon the American involvement in the inspections of these facilities. And it has been done because the administration doesn't want to have to follow up on what the inspections will demonstrate; namely, that action needs to be taken against Saddam Hussein. 
Or, failing that, if Saddam Hussein says, `I am not going to allow you to inspect certain facilities,' the administration will then be forced with the option of either doing nothing or of having to take some kind of action. And since the administration is unwilling, apparently, to take any kind of action, it therefore has to select the option of doing nothing. But it obviously cannot be perceived as doing nothing, so instead it sweeps the problem under the rug, says, `We don't see any problem with Saddam Hussein.' And of course you don't see any problem if you have your eyes closed, if you are not engaging in any inspections, or you are not allowing your inspectors to engage in the key inspections. 
Frankly, Mr. President, the administration's duplicity in this regard is something that the Congress should not permit and the American people need to be aware of. We ought to have the truth from the administration. Have we changed our policy with respect to Iraq? Have we decided not to enforce the agreement anymore? And what are the implications of this policy? 
Scott Ritter has laid forth his allegations. The administration has responded simply with denials. And yet there are enough sources who confirm Scott Ritter's allegations to cause me to believe that the administration's denials are false, that in fact Secretary of State Albright has, in one way or another, discouraged the American inspectors from inspecting key facilities that the inspectors believe need to be inspected because of what would be revealed. 
So, Mr. President, here is where we are now. After the agreement that Saddam Hussein entered into, in which he agreed to allow inspections to ensure that he did not develop the capability to pose a threat to his neighbors, part of the containment policy--as a result of that agreement, the United States had enforced for a period of years the inspection regime through UNSCOM--we are now no longer doing that in practice. It is now a charade. 
The reason it is a charade is because we don't want to face the consequences of either, A, being denied the ability to engage in the inspections or, B, finding something we don't want to find, because in either event we would have to do something, and this administration is frozen into inaction in dealing with Saddam Hussein. If they can lob a few cruise missiles at a problem, as they did against the terrorist Osama bin Laden 10, 12 days ago, then they can say they have taken action. 
But that is not enough in dealing with Saddam Hussein. He is more clever. He knows that we lack patience. He knows that if he defies us long enough, eventually our allies will desert us because, A, we don't have the capability anymore of keeping the coalition together and, B, the American people will get tired of the issue and no longer be willing to support the kind of military action or long-term action that would be required to oust Saddam Hussein. 
The result of this is that the United States has, in fact, changed its policy with respect to Iraq without telling either the Congress or the American people. It apparently no longer intends to enforce the agreement that George Bush and his administration insisted Saddam Hussein make. 
The implications for peace in the world are significant, because when Saddam Hussein has been able to build up his weapons of mass destruction to the level where he can cause significant damage, he will either do so or he will threaten to do so. At that point, his capability will cause a lot of countries in the world, especially those close neighbors who fear that kind of activity on his part, to back off of any opposition to him. His neighbors are relatively unprotected and, not believing the United States is a reliable ally to protect them, they will accede to his demands. Then, rather than having one or two countries in the Middle East that we have to contend with, we will have one or two belligerents and a lot of neutral parties who no longer cooperate with us in restricting his activities and his aggression and his terrorism. 
We need these countries in the fight against terrorism. I am very concerned that by backing off of the enforcement of the agreement against Saddam Hussein we will have permitted terrorism to further its goals in the Middle East and around the world, especially against Americans; and will have advanced the day when Iraq decides to engage in yet another form of aggression. 
I think it is a sad day when not only do we see U.S. foreign policy in tatters, in shambles, with respect to a country that we know poses a threat to us, but an administration which is unwilling to come clean on its policy. I know these are harsh words, but the fact of the matter is the administration has not leveled with the American people on this problem. I believe that Scott Ritter is essentially correct in his assessment of the situation, especially the administration's decision to pull the plug on the inspections in any meaningful way. As a result, I think this matter deserves airing in the Senate, in the House, and before the American people. I expect, either as chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism or as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I will ask the administration to explain its position. I think the Senate will probably have to take some action before we adjourn in October to ensure that this country has a strong policy with respect to one of the rogue nations of the world. 
In conclusion, when discussing this in my home State of Arizona this last month, one of my friends said, `Isn't it the obligation of the President to conduct the foreign policy and shouldn't the Congress leave that to the President?' The answer is, as I said, as a general proposition, yes. But when an administration is frozen into inaction for one reason or another, whether the President is being distracted by other matters or whether it is simply too hard a problem for the administration to want to deal with, then the Senate, in its historic role as a partner in the administration of foreign affairs, needs to insert itself into the equation. To the extent we need to influence the development and execution of foreign policy in this area, the U.S. Senate will have to be involved. 
I would rather the administration develop a policy and a strategy and execute it with the cooperation of the Senate, but if the administration is unwilling to do that, then the Senate will have to get involved. It is not a happy day to have to talk about this kind of thing in this way. We would much rather cooperate with the administration. I hold myself out to be willing to do that at any time and any place. But the administration has to come clean with the American people on what its strategy really is in dealing with Iraq. Until that statement of strategy has been laid out in an honest way, the Senate is going to have to involve itself in this issue. 
I hope and pray we will be able to maintain peace in the Middle East and that we will be able to contain Saddam Hussein, but it is going to require commitment and will, not just of the American people, but of the American Government. I am hoping in the next few weeks we can help develop the policy so, between the administration and the Congress and the American people, we will jointly, together, unify and be able to confront this threat to peace in the world. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as long as the majority leader is still on the floor, let me repeat what I told him a couple days ago. The remarks he made on the occasion of the public ceremony in the Rotunda for the two fallen Capitol Police officers, I thought, were extraordinary, right on the mark, and I very much appreciate his representation of the Senate at that occasion. This Nation has now spent 1 week thinking very carefully about what the meaning of the events of just a week ago are. 
I think that his remarks and the remarks of other speakers on that occasion certainly help to bring proper perspective to those events for all Americans as well as those of us here in the Congress.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to talk this morning about something called the Rumsfeld Report. 
There has been a lot of discussion about the Rumsfeld Commission Report in the news media here in Washington. But around the country I have noted there is less coverage of it. 
I want to talk a little bit about it today, because I think that the Rumsfeld Commission Report issued to the Congress about 2 weeks ago is probably the most important report that this Congress has received and that it is one of the most important events of the last 2 years with respect to the obligations of the Congress and the administration to ensure the national security of the United States. Of course, when all is said and done, our first responsibility is to the defense of the American people. 
By way of background, in the 1996 defense authorization bill we ensured that there was an amendment that required the establishment of the National Missile System by the year 2003. 
During the debate on that amendment, however--this was on December 1, 1995--Senators Carl Levin and Dale Bumpers received a letter from Joanne Isham of the CIA's Congressional Relations Office. That letter claimed that the language in the DOD bill relating to the threat posed by ballistic missiles--I am quoting now--`. . . [overstates] what we currently believe to be the future threat' of missile attack on the United States.' 
This is a letter from the CIA directly to Members of the Senate in opposition to an amendment that is pending on the floor. 
The letter also said, again quoting, it was `extremely unlikely' that nations would sell ICBMs and that the United States would be able to detect a home-grown ICBM program `many years in advance,' again quoting the letter. 
The statements in that CIA letter were based entirely on a new National Intelligence Estimate--an NIE. The title is `NIE 95-19.' It was entitled `Emerging Missile Threat to North America During the Next 15 Years.' It was released in its classified form in November 1995. 
But the key judgment of that NIE is, quoting: `. . .[no] country, other than the major declared nuclear powers, will develop or otherwise acquire a ballistic missile in the next 15 years that will threaten the contiguous 48 States or Canada.' 
President Clinton vetoed H.R. 1530, the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996, on December 28, 1995, in part because the National Missile Defense System called for pursuant to our amendment, in his words, addresses `. . . [a] long-range threat that our Intelligence Community does not foresee in the coming decade.'--end of quote of the President. 
In reaction, Mr. President, many Members of the Congress rejected the conclusions of that NIE as incorrect. Some of us on the Intelligence Committee believed that the information that we possessed suggested that the conclusions were inaccurate. Our concerns, frankly, centered on flawed assumptions underlying the key judgment of the NIE. The unclassified assumptions are--there are several. Let me tell you what they are: 
First, concentrating on indigenous development of ICBMs adequately addresses the foreign missile threat to the United States. 
What that means is, we can focus just on what these countries are able to build all by themselves and that that is going to be adequate in telling us what the threat posed by these countries will be in the future. 
Second, foreign assistance will not enable countries to significantly accelerate ICBM development. 
In other words, we are not going to look at what other countries might sell or give to these powers that we are concerned about, again relying on the notion that whatever they do they are going to do all by themselves without any help from the outside. 
In other words, third, that no country will sell ICBMs to a country of concern. 
Fourth, that no countries, other than the declared nuclear powers with the requisite technical ability or economic resources, will develop ICBMs from a space launch vehicle. 
In other words, they are not going to use the rockets that are used to launch satellites for military purposes to convert those missiles or rockets for military purposes. 
Another assumption: A flight test program of 5 years is essential to the development of an ICBM. 
Of course, when the United States and the old Soviet Union did research on a new missile, it would take 5 years for us to test it to make sure it worked properly, because it was always a new concept. 
So the CIA assumed in this NIE that it would take 5 years to develop a new missile. 
Seventh, that development of short- and medium-range missiles will not enable countries to significantly accelerate ICBM development. 
In other words, when they develop a shorter-range missile, that will have nothing whatsoever to do with their capability to develop more robust systems. 
Finally, the possibility of an unauthorized or accidental launch from existing nuclear arsenals has not changed significantly over the last decade. 
In my view, and in the view of many, these underlying assumptions ignored plain facts: Foreign assistance is increasingly commonplace and will accelerate indigenous missile programs. Other countries have sold, and almost certainly will continue to sell, weapons of mass destruction with ballistic missile components. The MTCR, which is the regime that is supposed to prevent this proliferation of weapons, has already been violated and is no doubt going to be violated again. And, finally, a flight test program does not have to follow the model of the United States or Soviet flight test program. 
So the conclusion that flowed from the faulty assumptions of the CIA National Intelligence Estimate had the effect of allowing unwarranted political conclusions to be reached and preached. 
Let me reiterate that. 
Because of the CIA's letter to Senators at the time that we were debating the national missile defense amendment, policy was affected. The President vetoed that bill based in part on the conclusions of the CIA's National Intelligence Estimate, which was based upon flawed assumptions, which turned out to be inaccurate. 
There were several reactions as a result of the President's action. 
The General Accounting Office and two former CDIs--Directors of Central Intelligence--Jim Woolsey and Bob Gates, each offered opinions about the NIE 95-19. 
The GAO prepared a report in September of 1996, and it concluded that the level of certainty regarding the 15-year threat which was stated in the NIE was, quoting, `overstated.' 
Former Director of the CIA Jim Woolsey validated this GAO assessment during a September 24, 1996, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. In his formal statement, Mr. Woolsey suggested the 1995 NIE asked the wrong question. 
He said the following:  
If you are assessing indigenous capabilities with the currently-hostile countries to develop ICBMs of standard design that can hit the lower 48 states, the NIE's answer that we may have 15 years of comfort may well be a plausible answer. But each of these qualifications is an important caveat and severely restricts one's ability to generalize legitimately, or to make national policy, based on such a limited document. 
Among the things that former DCI Bob Gates said about the NIE was that it was `politically naive.' 
Despite these concerns, the administration and opponents of missile defense were unwilling to hear views contrary to the conclusions of the NIE. Frankly, this is still the case. In May, when the Senate attempted to invoke cloture on the American Missile Protection Act, Senate bill 1873, offered by Senators Cochran and Inouye, the administration based its opposition to the bill on that previous NIE, National Intelligence Estimate 95-19. 
Here is the quotation from the administration's opposition: 
The bill seeks to make it U.S. policy `to deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).' 
That is true. 
In her letter stating the administration's position in opposition to Senate bill 1873, the Defense Department's general counsel stated, and I quote: 
The Intelligence Community has concluded that a long-range ballistic missile threat to the United States from a rogue nation, other than perhaps North Korea, is unlikely to emerge before 2010... Additionally, the Intelligence Community concluded that the only rogue nation missile in development that could strike the United States is the North Korean Taepo Dong 2, which could strike portions of Alaska or the far-western Hawaiian Islands. 
That is the end of the quotation from the Department of Defense general counsel. 
So the administration was still basing its opposition to missile defense on this National Intelligence Estimate of 1995. 
In the wake of the debate over that poorly crafted report, Congress asked for a second opinion. It appointed a bipartisan commission of former senior government officials and members of academia led by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, hence the name `The Rumsfeld Commission Report.' 
This bipartisan Commission was asked to examine the current and potential missile threat to all 50 States and to assess the capability of the U.S. intelligence community to warn policymakers of changes in this threat. 
The Commission unanimously concluded three things: No. 1, the missile threat to the United States is real and growing; No. 2, the threat is greater than previously assessed; and, No. 3, we may have little or no warning of new threats. 
Let me go back and review each of those. 
1. The missile threat to the United States is real and growing. 
`Concerted efforts by a number of overtly or potential hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with biological or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the United States, its deployed forces, its friends and allies. These newer, developing threats in North Korea, Iran and Iraq are in addition to those still posed by the existing missile arsenals of Russia and China, nations with which we are not now in conflict but which remain in uncertain transitions.' 
2. The threat is greater than previously assessed. 
`The threat to the United States posed by these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the Intelligence Community,' and a rogue nation could acquire the capability to strike the United States with a ballistic missile in as little as five years. 
3. We may have little or no warning of new threats. 
`The Intelligence Community's ability to provide timely and accurate assessments of ballistic missile threats to the United States is eroding.' 
`The warning times the United States can expect of new, threatening ballistic missile deployments are being reduced,' and under some plausible scenarios, `the United States might well have little or no warning before operational deployment [of a long-range missile.]' 
Now, Mr. President, why are the Rumsfeld Commission conclusions so different? 
First of all, the Commission answered a slightly different question than our intelligence agencies did in the 1995 NIE, by examining the missile threat to all 50 States. The intelligence community has acknowledged that Alaska and Hawaii could be threatened much sooner than 15 years from now, but for some reason did not include that in its 1995 estimate. 
Second, the Commission has access to the entire amount of information in the intelligence community--frankly, a broader and more highly classified set of information than most of the analysts in the compartmentalized intelligence world. Obviously, much information is compartmentalized to prevent its unauthorized distribution and release, but that also inhibits to some extent the ability of analysts to appreciate all aspects of the potential threat. 
Third, the Rumsfeld Commission recognized that missile development programs in Third World countries no longer follow the patterns of United States and Soviet programs. They might, for example, succeed in testing a missile one time, conclude that they have got it right because, after all, they are using a weapon that has been sold to them essentially by another country and then deploy it based upon one test, whereas the United States and the Soviet Union, as I said before, might well have had to engage in years of testing to ensure that a new product would work. 
Fourth, the Commission also understood that foreign assistance and technology transfers are increasingly commonplace. Without getting into the classified information in the Rumsfeld report, it is very clear that countries with which we are concerned have acquired a great deal of technology and in some cases components and perhaps even whole missile systems from other countries eager to earn the cash from the sale of those components or that equipment or technology. And so these nations did not have to do what the intelligence community thought they had to do, and that was to develop it indigenously, from the ground up, with only what the nation could produce. They have been very successful in acquiring technology from other countries which has naturally shortened the lead time for them to develop and deploy their own systems. 
Finally, and very importantly, the Rumsfeld Commission realized that foreign nations are aggressively pursuing denial and deception programs, thus reducing our insight into the status of their missile programs. In effect, what the Rumsfeld Commission concluded is this: That while the CIA in its estimate provided to us based its conclusions, in effect, on only what it could prove it knew, which, of course, is very little in the intelligence world, the Rumsfeld Commission examined what we knew and then asked questions about what the implications were about what we knew. 
Would it be possible, even though we have no evidence that a country has done certain things, that it could do so as a result of what we knew? And if our assumptions with respect to its intentions are correct, would it not be plausible to assume that they would try to do that; and if they tried to do it, might they succeed? 
So questions like that were asked in ways that were not based upon hard evidence in all cases but plausibilities and possibilities, and, as a result of asking those questions, some very troubling conclusions were reached which in many cases were verified by certain confirming evidence. And that is why we now understand that the nations with which we are most concerned have much more robust systems, both with respect to the missiles for delivery of weapons and the weapons on top of the missiles, than we had ever thought before. 
Second, these programs can be deployed with little or no warning. And third, and probably the key lesson to come out of this, we have to appreciate the fact that we will be surprised by surprises, but we should not be. We should not be surprised by surprises, because most of what these countries are doing we don't know, and we won't know until the weapon is used or it is finally tested and we realize that they have developed it or we find information in some other way that confirms a program that we previously did not know existed. 
So instead of being surprised at surprises, the Rumsfeld Commission report says we need to get into a new mode of thinking to understand that we should not be surprised by surprises, and that we should base our policy on that understanding. 
That is my concluding point, Mr. President. The Congress and the President, in setting national policy, in developing our missile defenses, in appropriating the funds to support those programs, should approach this with the understanding that we will have little or no advanced warning, that there is much that we don't know but that we are likely to be facing threats. Therefore, my conclusion is we have got to get on with the development of our missile defenses. That represents my three concluding points. No. 1, we have got to get on with the job of developing and deploying both theater missile defenses and a National Missile Defense System, and we can begin by voting for cloture and for the Cochran-Inouye bill when we return from the recess. 
Second, we must improve our intelligence capabilities and resources. 
And third, we must avoid arms control measures and diplomatic actions that impede our ability to defend ourselves and damage our intelligence sources and methods. 
We have a lot of work to do. Those of us on the Intelligence Committee have committed ourselves, based upon the briefing of the Rumsfeld report, to begin working on the intelligence aspects of this problem, and those who are on the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committees will also have to work toward correction of the problems of the past to assure that our missile defense programs can proceed with the speed that is required to meet these emerging threats. 
I conclude by thanking the members of this bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission and suggest to all of my colleagues that they become familiar with the contents of its report because it should certainly guide us in our policy deliberations with respect to the security of the United States from a missile threat in future years.  
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the U.S. Forest Service owns a large parcel of land within the boundaries of the town of Pinetop-Lakeside which has historically been used as a park, not only by the town residents, but also by the thousands of tourists who vacation in this bucolic area of Eastern Arizona each year. The town wants to maintain this land as a park. However, the Forest Service has refused to renew the town's special use permit for the largest section of this park, possibly paving the way for the land to be sold to private investors. The bill that Senator McCain and I are introducing, and Representative Hayworth is introducing in the House, prevents the Forest Service from selling the land to any entity other than the town, and requires the Forest Service, in conjunction with the town, to develop a management plan `designed to ensure that the tract is managed by the Forest Service for recreational purposes.' 
Mr. President, the town of Pinetop-Lakeside has been trying to find a way to acquire this parcel from the Forest Service for over 10 years, to no avail. This bill will satisfy the town's goal of preserving this land as a park, while being fair to the American taxpayer. However, the legislation will not solve the problems of communities that seek to acquire Forest Service lands to preserve open space, or to fulfill other essential governmental functions. I intend to continue to seek a long-term solution to those problems.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I will describe this amendment briefly. 
Frankly, this came out of the revelations concerning the alleged transfer of certain technology to the Chinese Government as a part of the process of launching American satellites on Chinese rockets, the so-called Loral-Hughes matter. But it really goes beyond that. It is a question of whether or not the Defense Department has in process an adequate way of reviewing the requests for export licensure and the conditions attached to those licenses to ensure that national security is not jeopardized. 
That role has in the past been played by an agency of the Defense Department called the Defense Technology Security Agency. It goes by the name of DTSA for the people who understand it. The point of this memorandum is to ensure that DTSA will continue to have a prominent role in the evaluation of export licenses and the kinds of conditions that would be attached to them. 
In fact, we ensure as a result of this amendment that the role is prominent by restoring the position of the Deputy Under Secretary for Technology Security Policy within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and thereby ensure, as I say, a prominent role for this agency. The Deputy Under Secretary would have access to both the Under Secretary of Policy and the Secretary of Defense himself. 
This is important, Mr. President, for the following reasons: 
No. 1, DTSA is the single agency in the Government reviewing the national security implications of an item for export; 
No. 2, DTSA coordinates input from the services, military branches, the Joint Chiefs and the defense agencies; 
No. 3, DTSA routinely supports the Department of State in its investigations of these matters; 
No. 4, creating a Deputy Secretary of Technology Security will ensure that the Department of Defense is represented at a sufficiently high level at the interagency meetings that occur to discuss these export licenses. 
And, finally, providing the Deputy Under Secretary with the authority to interact directly with the Secretary of Defense will enable the Deputy Secretary to bring items of immediate concern directly to the Secretary to discuss with the Secretary of Commerce and the President. 
The Department of Defense is the only agency with the expertise, the personnel, and the ability to assess the impact of exports on the national security of the United States, and this ought to be our No. 1 concern. The Persian Gulf war demonstrated the value of the United States maintaining a technical edge on the battlefield. Maintaining that edge in the future is dependent upon keeping sensitive technologies out of the hands of potential adversaries. 
Questions regarding the appropriate role of the Department of Defense in considering exports of dual-use items have obviously been of concern for a number of years. But, as I said, the alleged transfer technology to the Chinese Government has really elevated this concern to the point that there are those of us in Congress who want to ensure that the Department of Defense continues to have an important role here. 
Early in the 1990s, Congress examined the problems with export control and how it was possible that American companies, with the knowledge of the Department of Commerce, could have contributed to the Iraqi arms buildup, as we know occurred. We learned, for example, that between 1985 and the imposition of the U.N. embargo on Iraq in August of 1990, the Department of Commerce approved for sale to Iraq 771 export licenses for dual-use goods. Some of these sales involved technologies that very probably helped the Iraqis develop ballistic missile, nuclear, and chemical weapons. In some cases, Commerce approved the sale over strong objections from Defense or without even consulting the Department of Defense at all. 
In 1994, the Export Administration Act expired and in 1996 dissolved, leaving no overarching legal forum to guide the export control policies of the United States. Export controls were at that point directed by Executive order. And this resulted in relaxed control over national-security-related equipment and technologies. The GAO has documented potential problems with changes that occurred in 1996 and with the Department of Commerce retaining the primary responsibility for oversight of important national security equipment or technology. 
Let me just give a couple of examples here. On September 14, 1994, the Department of Commerce approved an export of machine tools to China. The tools had been used in a plant in Ohio that produced aircraft and missiles for the U.S. military. Some of the more sophisticated machine tools were diverted to a Chinese facility engaged in military production, possibly cruise missile production. 
Under current referral practices, the majority of applications for the export of categories related to stealth are not sent to the Department of Defense or the Department of State for review. Without such referrals, it cannot be ensured that export licenses for militarily significant stealth technology are properly reviewed and controlled. 
A third example: Commercial jet engine hot section technology was transferred to the Department of Commerce in 1996. Defense officials are concerned about the diffusion of technology and the availability of hot section components that could negatively affect the combat advantage of our aircraft and pose a threat to U.S. national security concerns. So the Defense Department must have an active role and a strong position in advising the President about the national security implications of exporting these and other important dual-use technologies. 
In order to do this, the Secretary of Defense must have the best advice available. This amendment will ensure that Secretary Cohen and all subsequent Secretaries have that advice. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time I hope we can engage in further discussion of this to ensure that the national security of the United States is not impaired. 
At this time, unless there is anyone else who would like to discuss it, I am happy to have the chairman or the ranking member move to other business.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the purpose of this bill, `The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act', is to address one of the fastest growing crimes in America, identity theft. Losses related to identity theft have nearly doubled in the last two years. Today, 95% of financial crimes arrests involve identity theft. Trans Union, one of the country's three major credit bureaus, says calls to its fraud division have risen from 3,000 a month in 1992 to nearly 43,000 a month this year. This is more than a troubling trend. Indeed, with increasing frequency, criminals--sometimes part of an international criminal syndicate--are misappropriating law-abiding citizens' identifying information such as names, birth dates, and social security numbers. And while the results of the theft of identification information can be devastating for the victims, often costing a citizen thousands of dollars to clear his credit or good name, today the law recognizes neither the victim nor the crime. 
The bill, as reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, does both. It recognizes the crime by making it unlawful to steal personal information and enhancing penalties against identity thiefs. It recognizes victims by giving them the ability to seek restitution for all costs involved in restoring lost credit and reputation. In addition, my bill provides real time relief to victims by directing the Federal Trade Commission to set up a centralized complaint center to provide information to consumers, refer cases to law enforcement, officially acknowledge complaints, and relay that acknowledgment to credit bureaus. 
And while section 1028 of title 18 currently prohibits the production and possession of false identification documents, it does not make it illegal to steal or possess another person's personal information. By amending section 1028, this bill will help current law keep pace with criminals' exploitation of information technology. 
The substitute I am offering today with Senators Leahy, Hatch, Feinstein along with Senators DeWine, D'Amato, Grassley, Abraham, Faircloth, Harkin, Warner, Murkowski, and Robb reflects two small but important improvements over the bill reported out of committee. Both changes were recommended by the Department of Justice. First, the substitute further refines the scope of the offense and applicable punishments by deleting the term `possession' from the offense and penalty sections of the reported bill. As explained by the Department, the term `possession' is overbroad as applied to identity theft offense added to the criminal code by this legislation. The second change simply adds standard forfeiture procedure to the existing criminal forfeiture penalty in the reported bill. Without a procedure attending the forfeiture penalty, the Department considers this penalty unenforceable. 
There are numerous private entities and federal law enforcement agencies that supported and contributed to this bill through its redraftings to its present form that I would like to thank. 
On the private side, thank yous go to the American Bankers Association, the Associated Credit Bureaus, Visa and Mastercard, the American Society of Industrial Services, and the United States Public Interest Research Group. 
Public agencies which lent important support to this legislative effort are the: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, and the U.S. Postal Inspectors. Special thanks goes to the Secret Service and the Department of Justice for the great deal of time and effort they have expended to help make this bill the well drafted piece of legislation it is today. 
In conclusion, I also thank Senators Leahy, Hatch and Feinstein for lending their valuable support and input to this bill.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are a lot of things wrong with our nation's Tax Code, but two things in the code that have always struck me as particularly egregious are the steep taxes imposed on people when they get married and when they die. Today, we will have a chance to vote to end the marriage penalty. 
All of us say we are concerned that families do not have enough to make ends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for child care or college, or to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a system that overtaxes American families. 
According to Tax Foundation estimates, the average American family pays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes to federal, state, and local governments. To put it another way, in families where both parents work, one of the parents is nearly working full time just to pay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, then, that parents do not have enough to make ends meet when government is taking that much. It is just not right. 
The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an extra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, and the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight percent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest percentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 and $30,000 per year. 
Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their pockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they choose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one parent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make four to five payments on their car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine months. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that if couples need advice about their decision to marry, they should be encouraged to look to their minister or rabbi, or their family, not their accountant or the Internal Revenue Service. This amendment represents an effort to strengthen families and give them a chance to spend their hard-earned money in the way they best see fit. 
Given that federal revenues as a share of the nation's income, as measured by Gross Domestic Product, will set a peacetime record this year--a whopping 20.5 percent of GDP--and given that we are anticipating a budget surplus of more than $63 billion, it seems to me that there is no excuse for the Senate to allow the marriage-penalty tax to continue any longer. 
I urge my colleagues to join me today in voting to end the egregious marriage-penalty tax.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I would like to take a few minutes to describe the importance of HIDTAs, and specifically the creation of a new Central Arizona HIDTA. 
As you know, HIDTAs are an effective mechanism for fighting drugs and especially for combating the increase in methamphetamine use and meth labs. Arizona has a huge problem with meth and meth lab cleanup. In April, I held a field hearing in Phoenix on this issue and I heard first-hand about the magnitude of the drug problem in urban and rural areas of the state. For example, I heard testimony that the Maricopa County HIDTA Meth Lab Unit presently dismantles an average of three labs per week and that, during fiscal year 97, it seized 137 meth labs. Projections for seizures this year are expected to reach 200. Moreover, the DEA testified that clandestine lab seizures in Arizona have increased 910 percent since 1994. 
The formation of a new Arizona HIDTA, the Central Arizona HIDTA, is a cooperative effort among three Arizona counties--Maricopa, Pinal, and Mohave--representing both rural and urban interests. 
Designating new HIDTAs where a need can be demonstrated and where law enforcement has joined together is key to stopping the spread of drugs. I look forward to working with you to ensure that new HIDTAs, like the Central Arizona HIDTA, receive funding.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho wishes to close. Therefore, let me reiterate the key points that the Senator from New Jersey, and also the Senators from Wyoming and Nevada, have made; that is, that you cannot have any exceptions to a national prohibition on Internet gambling if you want the policy to work, because if anyone can do it, then the gambling can occur in the homes, in the privacy of the homes around this country by children, by problem gamblers, or by anyone else if there is any exception because the Internet reaches across interstate boundaries. It knows no boundaries. It reaches into any State. And no State can protect its citizens and protect its public policy of outlawing this activity. 
I want to make it very clear that this activity is not being conducted legally today. 
In a letter written by the State attorneys general, including the attorney general of Idaho on this precise point, the attorneys general said, 
If Internet gaming is allowed to facilitate the remote placing of bets on an Indian gaming activity, the ultimate absurdity would result. The logical consequence of such a position is that any off-reservation telephone, computer with a modum et cetera, would become a gambling device by which the consumer could communicate with the tribe for the purpose of gambling. 
And they specifically refer to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe in Idaho, which is the tribe that the Senator from Idaho wants to permit to gamble. 
I urge a vote against the Craig amendment. 
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I thank everyone for the last vote. 
The point is, if you are going to ban an activity because the public policy of all 50 States is that their children and the families in those States should be protected from this activity, if you ever allowed one exception, then because of the nature of the Internet, you wouldn't have a bill. 
I appreciate that, and I think that clears the way for passage of the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. I note for the Record some of the organizations that support this legislation: Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, the Christian Coalition, the Focus on the Family and Family Research Council, National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling and Against Gambling Expansion.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, sports organizations, in particular, are obviously very much afraid of the adulteration of professional and amateur sports. As a result, groups like the National Amateur Athletic Association, Major League Baseball, NFL, NBA, National Hockey League, National Soccer League, and, of course, law enforcement and all 50 States attorneys general support this legislation. In fact, it is because of them that we are proposing it. We can't protect the citizens of our States unless we have legislation of this kind.

Mr. KYL. Yes, assuming each facility that participates in the pools is duly licensed by the State or approved by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which it operates. Subsection (8)(C)(ii) states that `information exchanged between' certain racetracks or other parimutuel facilities and `a support service located in another State or foreign jurisdiction' is not considered `information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager' if `the information is used only for processing bets or wagers made by or with that facility under applicable law.' 
The location of the totalizator or other similar system used to process parimutuel pools is irrelevant if the parimutuel pools are transmitted from and received by facilities each of which is licensed by the State or approved by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which it operates. 
Similarly, commingling may require the use of data transmission or phone lines that pass through numerous states. In such event, it is irrelevant whether parimutuel wagering is legal in all such states. The only relevant inquiry is whether each of which is licensed by the State or approved by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which it operates. 
The term `support system' should be read broadly to mean any system or service necessary to transmit or process information related to the commingling of parimutuel pools, including totalizator systems, telephone lines, and other similar technological devices essential to the commingling process.

<TEXT>
Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment does and indicate the degree of support that exists for it. Before I do that, let me say that this amendment passed out of the Judiciary Committee with one dissenting vote several months ago. It had been our intention to bring the amendment to the floor as a separate, freestanding bill, but because there was not floor time available to do that, we have had to resort to the amendment process under this bill. I regret that we have to do that, but that is the only way we would get this important piece of legislation before the full Senate. 
Frankly, Mr. President, it has been good because, during the interim, we have been able to work with parties who had concerns about the bill, and I think, for the most part, we have worked the concerns out. I know that one matter remains to be dealt with later. But except for that, we have been able to improve on the bill since it passed out of the Judiciary Committee. 
As a result of that, I report to my colleagues that some of the groups and organizations that support this legislation--to give you an idea of the breadth of support we have, it came up because of the Attorneys General of the United States; all 50 attorneys general from our States approve of this and support this legislation and, frankly, they are the ones that asked the Judiciary Committee to move forward with the legislation. 
Jim Doyle, the Democrat attorney general from Wisconsin, testified two times before our committee strongly in support of this legislation. One of the things he said was--I will quote it; I will find the quote. 
But, in effect, what he said was ordinarily attorneys general don't come to the Federal Government and ask for statutes to be federalized; they like their own jurisdiction. But in this case they had to come before the Congress. The individual attorneys general simply cannot enforce their own State prohibitions. Why is that so? Because, if the State of South Carolina, for example, has made a public determination, as it has done, that this kind of gambling is illegal and ought to be illegal, and a neighboring State--let's say North Carolina--should allow people to broadcast into South Carolina these virtual casino games that people can now find on the Internet, or let's say that comes even from outside the country, which is where these actually emanate from for the most part, then the people of South Carolina cannot be protected even though their State policy is that their people not be subjected to this kind of gambling. That is why all 50 State attorneys general got together and came to us, and said, `Would you please help us solve this problem?' 
We have to be able to have a Federal law that is enforceable through the Federal courts as well as the State courts to prohibit this kind of activity. That was why we introduced the legislation and moved forward with it. But what we soon found was that the support for the legislation was much broader than that. You might expect that Louis Freeh, Director of the FBI, has expressed strong support for it. 
But we have also had strong support coming from amateur and professional sports organizations. You can understand why, because the integrity of sports depends upon people knowing that the outcome of any sporting event is not determined by someone gaming the system. 
Unfortunately, we have seen these kinds of stories about point shaving and the like. I will give you an example from my own State of Arizona where a student got deeply into debt. He played basketball and ended up pleading guilty to shaving points and trying to throw games in order to pay off his gambling debt. Neither amateur nor professional athletics can stand that kind of attack on the integrity of sports, and as a result they came to us. 
We have strong support for this legislation from the NCAA, the Amateur Athletic Association, from the National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Hockey League, the National Basketball Association, major league baseball, and a lot of different organizations that understand how insidious gambling can be when it is conducted in a medium such as the Internet, and as a result they strongly support this legislation. 
We also like to say until he moved on that, this legislation is supported all the way from Ralph Reed to Ralph Nader. Ralph Reed has moved on, but the Christian Coalition still supports the legislation; as does Ralph Nader, the Public Citizen organization which he represents, the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, and many other organizations. 
The reason I wanted to mention this at the very outset is simply to illustrate the fact that this legislation has broad, widespread support from a variety of organizations and interests around the country. 
In the meantime, from the time it passed out of the Judiciary Committee, we have been able to work with the so-called horse industry and the pari-mutuel betting to assuage concerns that they had originally expressed. 
We have also worked with the Internet providers who will be an integral part of the enforcement of this legislation. We have a letter from the main Internet providers indicating that they have no objection to this legislation passing in the form that it has passed. 
Mr. President, I have kind of given you an idea of the kind of support that we have for it. 
It is opposed, frankly, by two groups. One you will hear from--at least one Indian tribe. And perhaps some other Indians would like to have a carve-out; they would like to be excepted from this. Second, naturally the gambling interests offshore who stand to make billions of dollars from this illegal activity do not like it. So that is who is against it. 
Mr. President, I said this `illegal activity,' and I did that with a reason. The activity that we are largely prohibiting tonight is already illegal. The Wire Act, so-called, Telephone and Wire Act of 1961, makes it illegal to conduct sports gambling over the telephone, or a wire. So much of what is being prohibited in this legislation is already illegal. 
For those people who say, `Well, we would like to be able to conduct this activity,' their beef is not with our bill. Their beef is with existing law. One of these days wires are not going to be the means of electronic transmission. It is 
going to be fiber-optic cable or microwave transmission through satellites. We are not at all sure that when that happens that the Telephone and Wire Act will be able to be used by prosecutors in their prosecutions. 
Just a couple of months ago, the district attorney for the district of New York indicted 14 people for conducting this kind of illegal activity under the Telephone and Wire Act. But, Mr. President, that might not be possible in the future. That is why we want to update the Telephone and Wire Act. 
In addition to that, the second thing that this bill does is to ensure that, whether it is sports betting or not, the activity is illegal on the Internet because what has cropped up in recent months is something called the `virtual casino.' It looks a lot like a casino that you would go to that is perfectly legitimate such as Las Vegas or Atlantic City. It is on the Internet, and it comes outside of the country, because, of course, it is not illegal outside the United States--at least in some countries. But that is being, in effect, sent to American citizens in our country. 
The attorneys general of Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, and other States have no way to stop it under existing law. Our bill ensures that kind of `virtual casino' over the Internet is illegal, and that it is enforced through not only the usual means of enforcement but also with the ability of the prosecutors to go to the court and after a finding that this activity is being conducted over the Internet, to enjoin its further conduct by bringing in the Internet service provider, in most cases, and asking the Internet service provider to cut off the service, to pull the plug on the service from that particular web site. In some cases it will be very easy to do. In other cases, it is more complicated. We provided for that in the legislation. 
As I said, the Internet service providers--at least some of the largest groups, and I can provide the names if anyone is interested--are satisfied that the language that we have worked out in the bill for this purpose is at least not objectionable to them. 
Let me indicate that this is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is pretty clear that we need to stop it now because it is quickly becoming, or will become, a multibillion-dollar activity. 
A recent `Nightline' piece, which was devoted to Internet gambling, reported that there are now an estimated 140 gambling sites online. Two years ago, Internet gambling was a $60 million business. Last year it grew to $700 million, and some believe that by the year 2000 the figure will be $10 billion. 
Mr. President, if we don't stop this activity now, the money that is generated by this kind of illegal activity is going to, I am afraid, become so influential in our political process that we will never get it stopped. That is why we have to act this year. 
I might add, Mr. President--and I am so delighted to have the expertise and the support of the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan--that one of the reasons why the legitimate gaming organizations and activities in our country are also in support of this legislation is because they understand. They don't want gambling to get a bad name. A lot of money is made, and a lot of people are employed in the gaming industry in these States. They are highly regulated. 
When you go to a gaming activity in Las Vegas, you know that you are going to be treated fairly. If you win, you will get the money. You know exactly what the odds are. And there is a regulation commission that ensures that the rules are abided by. But that is not the case on the Internet. 
Here is the problem. 
Young children are getting really good at logging onto the Internet. They can log on in the morning. You have to put down a deposit of $100 or $500--whatever it might be. You do that with a credit card, frequently. And this child, in the privacy of the home, without any supervision, can simply gamble away whatever fortune the family had tied up in that particular credit card with no supervision. 
The kind of gaming that we have legalized in this country is the kind of thing where you have to go to that site. You have to engage in the activity there. It is highly regulated. 
One of the reasons this kind of activity is so dangerous is because there is nobody there to check the activity. It occurs in the privacy of your own home with nobody there to say, `Wait a minute. Haven't you done this long enough? Haven't you lost enough money?' 
Dr. Howard Schaeffer of the Harvard Center for Addictive Studies predicts that within 10 years youth gambling will be more a problem to society than drug use. 
And the youth of our society are the most at risk for conducting Internet gambling. First of all, they are the most adept at using the Internet. Secondly, they are in college and school, and this is where a lot of the computers are that our kids start on today. And on every major campus today there is organized gambling activity, according to law enforcement officials. Sports is the preferred subject of the gambling. 
So it doesn't take any imagination to appreciate that our Nation's children are at risk. And there is much more risk in this Internet gambling activity than in any of the other kinds of legalized gaming, highly regulated gaming, that is authorized in our country today. 
I won't go into all of the details about bankruptcies and suicide and that kind of thing except just to cite a couple of things here that ought to cause us pause. We know that about 5 percent of the people who gamble will become addicted. It is an addiction. Of those, about 80 percent will contemplate suicide, and about 17 percent of those will commit suicide. Bankruptcies are huge and growing. As a matter of fact, Ted Koppel noted that in his `Nightline' program, that last year 1,333,000 American consumers filed for bankruptcy, thereby eliminating about $40 billion in debt. And he talked about the percentage of that which is attributable to gambling, going into some of the statistics about a large percentage of that--in fact, something like 60 percent of people will get gambling debts that they can't pay. 
In fact, up to 90 percent of pathological gamblers commit crimes to pay off their wagering debts. That is the testimony before our committee. So suicides, bankruptcies, crimes committed to pay off debts, and the effect, of course, on the families. 
What does this have to do with our bill? This is the kind of activity that, by definition, is not regulated and is susceptible to addiction because there is nobody there. There is no inhibition in your own home; you just log on and you go do it. Of course, these virtual casinos are really good-looking things when you look at them on the screen. You can pull them up tonight, as a matter of fact. 
So, as I say, what we have done in the Judiciary Committee is to focus on this specific kind of activity as (A) needing to be updated because wire may no longer be the method of transmission of data and (B) because of these virtual casinos offshore. 
Let me describe a couple of the problems that we have dealt with in the legislation. One of the concerns was that the service providers would have difficulty in stopping the activity. Remember, what we have done here is to say that this activity is illegal, just like the Wire Act does. Theoretically, you could even prosecute the bettor, although that has never been done, and I don't anticipate it being done. 
What we are after here are the people running these gambling operations. The U.S. attorney in New York has indicted some people, some of whom were in the United States. So they have actually acquired personal jurisdiction over those people. They might be able to prosecute them, fine them, and send them to jail. But for the most part, these activities are going to be abroad, because the activity is illegal in all 50 States. As a result, you are not going to be able to get personal jurisdiction over the offender. 
How do we, therefore, stop the activity? That is where the service providers come in. And after, as I say, a finding of illegality has occurred, they will be brought in to appear before the court and be asked to pull the plug on a service that they are providing or, through them, is being provided to people on the net here in the United States. 
As I said, in the case of a direct provider, it is a little more technical than this but almost as easy as pulling the plug, because each of these sites has an identifier, an identifying number for billing purposes. Of course, you know that and you can simply cut off that particular service. In other cases, it will be more complicated than that. 
So what we have done is to provide a complex series of protections for the Internet provider to ensure, for example, that if they are asked to participate in this law enforcement activity, first of all, there won't be any injunction issue against them if it is not technically feasible; and, secondly, that they can demonstrate, if it is the case, it is not economically feasible for them. Then the injunction could not issue. This isn't a matter of what they are permitted to argue; these are actually conditions for the imposition of the injunction. 
I want to make it perfectly clear to my colleagues, up until a few days ago, you may have been contacted by various Internet providers, people like America Online, for example, or U.S. West. Their representatives, who are all over this town, may have told you that there were certain problems with this language. But they are among the organizations that have bought off on the language that I have painstakingly negotiated with them to ensure that, while they are helping law enforcement, we are not imposing an impossible burden on them. They are not 
going to have to do something that is not technically feasible, and they are not going to have to face unreasonable costs in complying with law enforcement. 
I know some people say they are part of the problem because they are actually transmitting this illegal information. But I don't think it is fair to ask them to monitor this activity or to stop it unless law enforcement deems it sufficiently serious to stop. And that is why we have only provided for them to be involved in this process in that eventuality. I think that is very, very fair. 
A second group that we have had discussions with is the virtual casino networks and operators. I know that Senator Bryan is going to talk to that because that is a part of his amendment. I must say that I totally support the amendment of Senator Bryan to add the protections in this legislation to those who are providing the games involving, for example, baseball where you get together with other people and you create your own baseball team and you then are judged by how well those teams and players do in the future. Sometimes there are prizes awarded, and sometimes there are not. But in any case, you usually pay a fee to do that, and if you win, you can win the prize. 
Now, the people who operate these kinds of activities on the Internet have variously claimed that it is not gambling or that no prizes are awarded. And if that is the case, then they have nothing to worry about under this legislation because both of those are requirements for it to be considered gambling. We also make it clear, if they charge administrative fees rather than collecting money to pay off bets, they would be exempt. 
I indicated before that we had solved the problems of the horse-racing industry. We essentially said with respect to that industry that this legislation does nothing to take away from any of the activity that they can do today, and, in fact, given the fact they are going to be using computers in their operation, and also in their advertising in the future, we make sure that activity is not prohibited. So, as I said, they are supportive of the legislation. 
I want to make it clear to anybody who has heard from anybody with respect to first amendment rights that the first amendment is totally protected here. All advertising is permitted. Any kind of advertising of legal activity is absolutely legal, and it would not even be constitutional for us to try to prohibit it. We have not done that. 
That leads me, Mr. President, to the last point which has to do with the treatment of the Native Americans. Now, under the IGRA, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Native Americans are permitted to enter into compacts with States to conduct the same kind of gambling or gaming that is legal in those States. They can't do any more than what is legal in the States, but they can compact to do that which is legal. We have provided in this legislation an explicit recognition of the Indian tribes to conduct that kind of activity on their reservations. We have also made it clear that they can engage in the kind of pooling arrangements that many of them will engage in and that that would not be illegal. 
So everything that is done by every tribe except one, which may be violating the law today and that you will hear more about here--everything that is currently being done and can be done legally is treated as legal in this legislation and would be permitted to continue. 
To the extent that the tribes were also concerned about enforcement by States attorneys general, we have made it clear that the States attorneys general are not to enforce this law against Indian tribes; that the only time a State attorney general could be involved is if the tribe itself compacted for that, so the tribe would have had to have agreed to it in the first instance. 
So we have satisfied all of the concerns of the tribes except one, and what you will hear is that they want to be able to do anything that is so-called legal or lawful under IGRA. 
But the problem with that is this. This legislation, just like the Wire Act that is still the law today, makes it illegal to conduct these kinds of activities. So since the Wire Act exists, a tribe could not conduct this activity claiming it to be legal under IGRA, because IGRA says you cannot do it if you do not have a compact, and you cannot have a compact unless it is legal. 
So, because this legislation and the Telephone and Wire Act both make it illegal to conduct this kind of activity, or continue to make it illegal, then, by definition, it would not be possible for a tribe to conduct this activity. 
What I am concerned about is that trying to add any other language that suggests that, if it is lawful under IGRA it would still be OK, would very much confuse and complicate the issue and raise a question about what the basic intent of this legislation is. And, at worst, it would actually permit the Native Americans or Indian tribes who wish to do so, to do something that nobody else in the country would be able to do, that would be illegal for every other American. What we have done is to treat the Native Americans fairly, to treat them like everybody else--no better, no worse. It would be, I think, a grave injustice to everyone else to allow a special exception for the Indians that nobody else in the country would have. 
Mr. President, I will have some more to say about a couple of the details of what we do, especially if there are questions, and also to further talk about the kind of testimony that was presented to the Judiciary Committee in support of this legislation. As you might imagine, there was a wide variety of testimony provided by law enforcement officials, people familiar with gaming and with addiction, people who understood the Internet and wanted to advise us about that. Frankly, we just had a lot of great testimony that supports this. 
I will just close with this one comment that I think helps to make the point. I mentioned the attorney general from Wisconsin--I was going to quote this before--James Doyle. He is the head of the Attorneys General Association. He said:  
Gambling on the Internet is a very dumb bet because it is unregulated. Odds can be easily manipulated and there is no guarantee that fair payouts will occur. Internet gambling threatens to disrupt the system. It crosses State or national borders with little or no regulatory control. Federal authorities must take the lead in this area. 
I close where I began. For State attorneys general to urge the Federal Government to take Federal jurisdiction over something like this is almost unprecedented. They wouldn't do it if they didn't feel that the problem societally justified it and, from a law enforcement standpoint, that it was the only way to ensure that this illegal activity could not be continued. 
So, as a result of that, we have adopted this legislation out of the committee and brought it to the floor under this mechanism because, as I said, it is really the only way we could bring it to the floor. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to make something very clear since the Senator from Delaware is still on the floor. 
The Senator from Idaho has proposed an amendment that is a poison pill. I want to make it very clear that if by some chance it should pass, I will urge all of my colleagues to vote against my bill, because what it will do is create a monopoly. Indian tribes will be the only people in the country that will be permitted to engage in Internet gambling. Offshore casinos, virtual casinos, and Indian tribes would be able to do it; no other citizen would be allowed to do it. This is not a violation of IGRA. We do not provide for State enforcement unless an Indian tribe has already agreed by compact to do that. 
So I want to make it clear. I will read to you two sentences from a letter from the National Association of Attorneys General. I want the Senator from Delaware to listen to these words and to appreciate that this activity is illegal; it will be illegal for all Americans, and I think the last thing we want to do is create a situation in which one group of Americans can do this and nobody else can. This is a letter to Acting Chairman Deer and Commissioners Foley and Hogen of the National Indian Gaming Commission with respect to this issue: 
We are writing to you to express our strong opposition to and legal analysis regarding the use of the Internet for the purpose of engaging in gaming activity allegedly under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA). The undersigned have concluded that such gaming is not authorized by IGRA. 
That is signed by all of the attorneys general, including the attorneys general of Hawaii and Idaho and, as I said, all of the other attorneys general. 
I have practiced law for 20 years. I am very familiar with the law in this area. I am not misreading the law. With all due respect to our colleagues from Idaho and Hawaii--and I love them both, and they are great and fine Senators--on this matter, in my opinion, they are simply not correct. The effect of their amendment is so bad, as I said, it is a poison pill. It is so bad that I would have to urge all of my colleagues to vote against this amendment that Senator Bryan and I have proposed.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond, then, to my friend from Idaho. First, let me begin by saying that the Presiding Officer, when he spoke a few minutes ago, I think hit the nail right on the head. The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wyoming, pointed out that it didn't really matter who conducts the activity on the Internet. Whether it is an Indian tribe or an offshore virtual casino, the result is the same for the people of the State which has established the public policy of protecting its people from such activity. You can't do it. You can't protect your citizens. 
The State of Wyoming has made that decision, and yet if the Indians were allowed an exemption under this bill, they would be permitted to run Internet gambling operations, they could reach every citizen in every State and every young person in every State, as the Presiding Officer pointed out. 
No one is allowed to do that today. No one would be allowed to do that under the legislation, but under the Craig amendment, a special exception would be made for the Indians. The Senator from Idaho argues that it is legal for the tribes to do that. In this he is simply wrong. 
Again, let me quote from a letter from all 50 attorneys general, including the attorney general of Idaho, on this exact point. They are writing to the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
We are writing to you to express our strong opposition to and legal analysis regarding the use of the Internet for the purpose of engaging in gaming activity allegedly under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1998. The undersigned have concluded that such gaming is not authorized by IGRA. [One of the reasons, I might say, contained in the next sentence] As you know, under IGRA, gaming activity is allowed only on Indian lands. 
This goes beyond that. It goes to any State, into any home, to be used by any child who might log on to the Internet. All the people I quoted before who testified before the Judiciary Committee said this is a pernicious activity for young people who get into the Internet and begin gambling. It could become the most addictive way for children and, later, adults to become addicted to gambling. 
As a result, it is an activity that needs to be stopped before it is allowed to spread. What we should not do is create an exception just for the Indian tribes, because, in effect, that is an exception that precludes us from protecting our children. I urge, tomorrow, that we defeat the Craig amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Grassley amendment that is before us today expresses the sense of the Senate about a wide array of issues, about nine different issues in all. I agree with some of the ideas expressed in the amendment, but I have serious reservations about others. 
Mr. President, among the ideas I favor are the provisions of the amendment that express support for additional capital-gains and death-tax relief. 
Although it is unclear from the language of the amendment what form that relief should take, I hope Senator Grassley would agree with me that a good approach on capital gains would be something like the 70-percent exclusion that would be allowed by S. 73, the Capital Gains Reform Act, which I introduced last year. That is the same exclusion proposed by President John Kennedy some 35 years ago. 
Preferably, death-tax relief would mean outright elimination of the death tax, as proposed in S. 75, the Family Heritage Preservation Act. That bill, which I introduced last year, is cosponsored by 30 other Senators. 
Fast-track trade authority is something that I have voted for in the past, and I will vote for it again. Hopefully, we will have the chance to do that before the year is out. 
And I have long supported legislation that would provide full deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed. There is no good reason why people who are self-employed are singled out for disparate treatment when full deductibility is allowed for all other employees. We ought to provide 100 percent deductibility, and do it now, not several years from now. 
Unfortunately, there is more to the amendment than capital-gains and death-tax relief, health insurance, and fast track. There are other issues, too, and some of them are quite controversial. For example, the amendment expresses the support of the Senate for full funding for the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But what does full funding mean? Is it $3.5 billion or $18 billion--or will it be more, now that the IMF and Russia are talking about another bailout? Will the funding be conditioned on meaningful reform of the way the IMF does business? 
We do not know the answers to these questions from the language of the amendment. It is not designed to answer them, because it is merely a sense of the Senate amendment. But without knowing the answers, I believe it would be imprudent to go on record in support of `full funding for the IMF.' 
In fact, many of us have serious reservations about providing more money for the IMF, particularly it if is not accompanied by meaningful reform of the way the international agency does business. Many of us question the fundamental wisdom of having taxpayers bail out bad business practices and bad investment decisions abroad. Therefore, I would have to object to the IMF-related provisions we are considering here. 
There is also language in this amendment on economic sanctions. We addressed that issue yesterday when we considered the Lugar, Dodd, and Torricelli amendments, so I am not sure why we are considering it again, particularly since the amendment does not specify what kind of sanctions reform is in order. 
Most Favored Nation status for China is another controversial issue, and I believe we need to focus on it separately, more deliberately. There are far too many issues at stake this year to be considering MFN status along with myriad others in this sense of the Senate amendment. 
Mr. President, as I said at the outset, this is only a sense of the Senate amendment. It has no force of law, no effect, regardless of whether it passes. 
But I think it does cloud the record when issues like the IMF, economic sanctions, and MFN status for China are coupled with things like capital-gains and estate-tax reform, fast track, and health insurance. I would not want support for the latter set of issues to be construed as support for the former set. 
Since we will still need to act on separate legislation to accomplish the things raised by the Senator from Iowa in his amendment, and since there are some key elements of the amendment to which I object, I am going to vote against the amendment. It accomplishes nothing, and it adds confusion by suggesting that members either oppose or support everything in it. My `no' vote should be construed as a vote against this irrelevant and confusing procedure.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was disappointed by some of the actions of the majority leader's statement the day before yesterday in which he provided an update on the Senate inquiry into U.S. policy on satellite exports to China. 
In particular, some charged that the majority leader was engaging in partisan politics when he simply presented some of the things that we have learned in the 13 hearings and the numerous briefings and meetings held on that subject to date. 
As a member of the task force appointed by the leader, I can state conclusively, Mr. President, that this investigation is driven by a desire to safeguard our Nation's security, and it is not motivated by partisan politics. 
Let's examine the five main points that the leader raised in his remarks. 
Point one: The Clinton administration's export controls for satellites are inadequate and have not protected U.S. security. 
Many of us have been dismayed at the lax implementation and the irregular application of safeguards during launches of American satellites in China. For example, the Clinton administration has failed to require Defense Department monitors for every Chinese launch of U.S. satellites. Monitors are typically Air Force officers who are required to be present at all meetings with the Chinese launch service provider and the American satellite exporter. The monitor's presence is necessary because sensitive know-how can be inadvertently disclosed. 
Chinese officials make no secret of their desire to obtain high-tech information, and the incentive for an American company to provide information necessary for a successful launch of a multimillion-dollar satellite is great, 
therefore a monitor can be extremely helpful in reducing the amount of information that is shared with Chinese engineers and scientists. 
Although Clinton administration officials routinely note the importance of monitors in testimony and briefings, under the current system, monitors are not required by statute, regulation, or international agreement. In fact, during three satellite launch campaigns conducted in China since 1995, monitors have not been present at any stage of the process. In three other launch campaigns in China, though not required by the government, monitors have been present only for the launch, but not the important technical exchange meetings dealing with mating the satellite to the launch vehicle and ensuring that it survives the stressful launch environment and is delivered intact to the intended orbit. 
The majority leader's point that export controls on satellites are inadequate is not merely endorsed by the members of the task force. As the New York Times said in an editorial on the issue on May 26, `In its eagerness to improve relations with Beijing and expand American commerce in China, the White House has been careless about enforcing security protections.' One month later, the New York Times again commented on the subject in another editorial on June 19 which stated,  
Evidence keeps mounting that the Chinese Army is exploiting flawed American export controls to acquire sophisticated satellite communications technology for military and intelligence use. The Pentagon and State Department are now questioning the pending sale of a Hughes communications satellite whose upgraded design would let Chinese authorities eavesdrop on mobile telephone conversations at home and abroad. President Clinton should suspend this sale and the licensing of any more satellite deals with China until export control rules are tightened. In particular, he needs to put the State and Defense Departments back in charge of export approvals and diminish the role of the Commerce Department. 
That is the New York Times speaking. That is not the majority leader. It is obviously a sentiment he shares. 
This sentiment is shared on a bipartisan basis. During a hearing of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Senator Cleland criticized the administration for shifting responsibility for regulating 
satellite exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department stating, `I've got more and more concern about Commerce becoming the lead dog here. I'd rather hedge my bets and put national security first and commerce second.' 
The second point made by the leader day before yesterday was that in violation of stated United States policy, sensitive technology related to satellite exports has been transferred to China. 
Mr. President, this is also an accurate, objective statement that is widely shared. Additional hearings will be necessary to continue to gauge how much damage has been done to United States national security, but several launches have occurred in China without the necessary safeguards and at least two analyses conducted by American companies of failed launches have been sent to China without first being reviewed by the State or Defense Departments. 
As the Washington Post said on May 31, 
There is little dispute that some American know-how inevitably seeped across to the Chinese, despite strict rules covering what technology United States companies could share with the Chinese and despite the monitoring of contracts by United States Air Force specialists. The argument is over how much seepage occurred and whether any of it helped China improve its military rockets. 
Again, the majority leaders' comments are vindicated by the press. 
The third point made by the leader day before yesterday was that China has received military benefit from United States satellite exports. 
Additional information in this regard may be uncovered as the Senate's inquiry continues, but some key information has already come to light. Last month, in a front page story published on June 13, the New York Times broke the news that, 
For the past two years, China's military has relied on American-made satellites sold for civilian purposes to transmit messages to its far-flung army garrisons, according to highly classified intelligence reports. The reports are the most powerful evidence to date that the American Government knew that China's Army was taking advantage of the Bush and Clinton Administrations' decisions to encourage sales of American high technology to Asian companies. 
Again, the majority leader was not wrong. He is right. 
The fourth point made by the majority leader was that the administration has ignored overwhelming information regarding Chinese proliferation and has embarked on a de facto policy designed to protect China and United States satellite companies from sanctions under United States nonproliferation law. 
This is another objective observation about what we have learned from the hearings conducted so far. And again I turn to reports in the media in confirmation of the majority leader's point. As the Washington Post reported on June 12, 
The former chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's weapons counter-proliferation efforts told a Senate committee yesterday that the Clinton Administration's determination not to impose economic sanctions on China led it to play down persuasive evidence that Beijing sold nuclear-capable M-11 missiles to Pakistan. `There's no question in my mind' that China sold 34 M-11 missiles to Pakistan in November 1992, Gordon Oehler, former director of the CIA's Nonproliferation Center, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Intelligence agencies are `virtually certain' the sale occurred he said, but `intelligence analysts were very discouraged to see their work was regularly dismissed' by Clinton aides. 
Yet despite this overwhelming evidence, the Clinton administration has not imposed sanctions and as a result of the transfer of authority over satellite exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department, satellite exports have been shielded from the effects of sanctions. Prof. Gary Milhollin made this point in testimony to the Armed Services Committee on July 9, stating, 
One of the main effects of this transfer has been to remove satellites from the list of items that are subject to U.S. sanctions for missile proliferation. In effect, the transfer has given Chinese firms a green light to sell missile technology to Iran and Pakistan. Chinese companies can now sell components for nuclear-capable missiles without worrying about losing U.S. satellite contracts. 
The administration has been interested in shielding China from the effects of United States nonproliferation sanctions for some time. According to a classified National Security Council memo reprinted in the Washington Times in March, the administration believed one of the benefits of United States support for China's membership in the Missile Technology Control Regime would be `substantial protection from future U.S. missile sanctions.' 
And again what the majority leader said is on the record. It is vindicated. It is not wrong. 
The fifth and final point made by the majority leader day before yesterday was that new information has come to light about China's efforts to influence the American political process and that the Attorney General should name an independent counsel to investigate. 
I serve on the Intelligence Committee which recently received classified testimony from the Attorney General and the Director of Central Intelligence on this subject. While obviously I will not comment on that testimony here, I simply point out that over the past few months a great deal of troubling information has been published on the subject in the press. As the Senate investigation proceeds we may uncover additional information in this area, but in my view the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate these allegations is already long overdue. 
As I have tried to demonstrate today, attempts to portray the majority leader's statement or the work of the task force as partisan politics are simply invalid. The protection of our nation's security has been--and should be--our only concern. I urge my colleagues to examine the Record before leveling such charges. Although the Senate investigation will continue, it is clear that we must change the way we handle export controls on sensitive technology or risk further jeopardizing America's security. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that when the majority leader made his controversial remarks, he was right and the record needs to reflect that. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to speak to this amendment and express a contrary view to that expressed by my colleague who has just spoken. With all due respect to the Senator from Indiana, who has put a lot of work into this, and who has offered the amendment, and while agreeing with much of what is in the amendment and much of what he proposes to try to do, I have to object for two reasons to the consideration of the amendment at this time. 
First of all, it is in reaction to--at least partially, although he has been at this for a long time, and understanding that we do need to make some changes--what has occurred with the sanctions placed on India and Pakistan. We just resolved the issue with India and Pakistan primarily because of the amendment we just passed, which eliminates the agricultural component, broadly defined, of the India/Pakistan sanctions. Therefore, to the extent that my colleague, Senator Roberts, was just speaking, and others who have talked about the impact on our farmers as a result of the imposition of those sanctions, we have solved that situation. 
As a matter of fact, if you analyze the other sanctions imposed as a result of their nuclear tests, it gets down to a very narrow issue of some Eximbank loans or World Bank loans primarily and, therefore, I urge us not to rush into a consideration of this amendment on this particular appropriations bill because of the need to fix something that was not done with respect to India and Pakistan, when we have already begun to solve that problem. 
Secondly, because of the fact that sanctions have not always worked as we have desired them, and because of the obvious deficiencies with the sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan, the majority leader has appointed a bipartisan task force, consisting of Members of both parties, with different backgrounds, to deal with this question. We had a meeting yesterday. 
I am somewhat shocked that the Senator from Indiana would offer this amendment today, because yesterday he said that he wanted to preserve the option of proposing this amendment at some time in the future. But he seemed to agree with the majority opinion expressed there--in fact, all but one of the Members, in one way or another, expressed a view that a September 1 deadline was somewhat unrealistic in trying to deal with this problem. The Senator did preserve his option to offer an amendment at a future date, but I am shocked that it is offered today because the task force has not had an opportunity to review this matter in any depth. 
Madam President, I would like to now discuss some of the things that we talked about yesterday, which I think will illustrate the fact that this amendment is prematurely offered at this time. Again, notwithstanding the fact that the goals behind it--to review broadly our sanctions policy and some of the specifics about it, and to be more careful about how we impose sanctions--are both worthwhile and, in many respects, something we can all agree on, one of the things we can't agree on is a definition of what a sanction is. There is a broad definition, according to the Senator from Indiana. I wonder whether we are really ready to apply the limitations and the 
tests that are called for in this amendment to foreign aid reductions, because as I read the proposal, one of the sanctions would be a reduction or elimination of foreign aid. 
U.S. aid is not an entitlement. We are going to make different decisions every year about how much foreign aid we may want to give to a country. Should that be subject to the limitations imposed in this amendment? How about export controls on sensitive U.S. technology? 
We just came from a very highly classified briefing of a committee that was specially appointed to examine the missile threat to the United States. That report is, I must say, extraordinarily concerning, I am sure, to everybody who received it. On some of the countries that pose this threat to us, we have imposed stringent export controls with respect to sensitive technology going to those countries, which could assist them in the development of their ballistic missile technology programs. Are we going to impede the President's ability and Congress' ability to impose those kinds of limitations on the sensitive export of technology to countries that we don't want to have that technology? As I read the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, that is all covered. 
We need to have a common definition of what a sanction is in order to apply these kinds of limitations. And there should not be a 45- or 60-day--I think it is now reduced to 45 days--waiting period. There are all kinds of things that would cause either the President or Congress to want to impose sanctions right away and not wait 45 days.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will give the Senator my understanding of it, but I would be pleased, also, to refer that question to the Senator from Indiana.

I think the Senator from Indiana should defend his own proposal.

Mr. KYL. We will get back to that because I am not sure--if that is the intent of the Senator, I will have to see whether or not, in fact, it is effectuated. 
Let me get to another national security issue. We have, I think, come to the conclusion--most of us, but not all in this body--that it would be a mistake to put an explicit time limit, for example, on our presence in Bosnia, or an explicit time limit on certain other kinds of military activities or threatening national security activities because, of course, what that does is enable the party against whom the action is being taken to simply ride it out and to understand if they can just get by the next 60 days or 6 months, then they will not have to worry about that. So we have always taken the position that when it comes to this kind of thing--national security--our actions should be somewhat open-ended to ensure that the other party begins acting in the way that we would like to have that party act. 
Obviously, when you have a 2-year sunset on these kinds of sanctions, you eliminate that flexibility. I think that is one of the reasons why most of us have tended to want to support the kind of review and analysis about which the Senator from Indiana is talking. Clearly, that kind of thing should be done. But there should be a mechanism for the Congress and the President to, in effect, pull the plug on a sanction whose time has run rather than to have an arbitrary time limit for its imposition. 
If the Senator from Indiana would like to respond, I am happy to yield.

Mr. KYL. If I could, Madam President, go to another point; that is, the failure to discriminate among or between different kinds of sanctions. 
The amendment, as I read it, treats all sanctions alike. It does not differentiate between sanctions imposed for the transfer of nuclear technology, for example, or the exploding of nuclear devices in violation of treaties, and sanctions imposed for less dangerous activities, for example. In a sense, when one reads it, it appears to condone sanctions which have as their goal the promoting of trade but severely restricts sanctions for other purposes. 
I understand that the Senators from farm States have been very concerned about limitations on exports of agricultural products. 
As I say, I think we are all pleased to support the amendment which enables India and Pakistan to import American agricultural products. But I think we ought to examine this in a balanced way and understand that many of the sanctions are imposed for national security reasons. I think most of us understand that national security has to take a front seat to other considerations of a lesser degree of priority, if, in fact, it has gotten to the point that the country, either the President or the Congress, thinks it is in our national interest to impose sanctions. Yet, under the sweeping definition of a sanction here to mean literally `any restriction or condition on economic activity,' it appears there is no differentiation to account for the differences in reasons why we impose sanctions. 
For example, as I said before, we may have a reason to sanction a particular country, or a particular kind of trade activity, because of the national security implications of that. With respect to China, for example, we require a special waiver for certain kinds of technology transfers, or the launching of satellites, just to cite one example. It seems to me that is an entirely different kind of sanction than the typical kind of trade sanction on imports or quotas that we might apply for some other reason. 
I think it is very important for us to try to come to some agreement on a definition of just exactly what is a sanction before we begin applying across the board a set of rules that would automatically sunset sanctions after 2 years; that would require a 45-day time period before sanctions could be implemented; that would change the rules of the Congress, in effect, after first stating that it is our policy that these things should be done, and changing the rules of the Senate to ensure that policy is affected. 
It seems to me that we have time to deal with this now since we have dealt with the immediate emergency. The leader has appointed a task force, and we have identified this as one of the things that we need to do in this task force so that we are clear about the differentiation between the different kinds of sanctions before we begin identifying what kind of limitations should be placed upon each of them, and, therefore, that consideration of this amendment at this time is premature notwithstanding the fact that many of the ideas in the Senator's amendment might well be the kinds of things that we would adopt for certain kinds of sanctions when we end up actually adopting legislation. 
But, clearly, this is not something in which there is an easy one-size-fits-all solution. I fear that is what we are doing by trying to rush this matter. 
I will be happy to yield the floor at this time. I will have other things to say, but I know the Senator from Kentucky, who chairs the task force, wants to speak to the issue as well.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am sure when my colleague just referred to a `no-brainer,' that no one would be in opposition to it, he wasn't suggesting there is not a logical, reasonable argument in opposition to the amendment, and I would like to again try to make that and urge my colleague, if he would like, to engage in any kind of colloquy he would like to clarify what I have to say, to at least assure him that there is a reasonable argument on the other side. 
I want to begin by commending Senator Lugar for identifying many of the things which ought to be done with respect to the imposition of sanctions in his amendment. He has a lot of good material in this amendment. I know he has given it a lot of thought. I think, at the end of the day, we will be able to accept a lot of that. 
Mr. President, I also believe there are some things that are not adequately thought out here. I would like to focus on a few of those. One of the things I am pleased with is a very broad definition of national emergency, which would permit the President to essentially waive the requirements of the legislation in the event of a national emergency, which is very, very broadly defined here. In one sense, that is good. But in another sense, all of the good that we are trying to achieve here could be easily undone, simply because the President decided to go forward and waive in the interests of national security. If the national security definition were a little tighter, then what we are seeking to accomplish here could probably be done, and the President would not be able to undo it easily through the invocation of a national emergency waiver. 
So I want to begin this part of the debate by acknowledging that some of what the Senator from Indiana is seeking to do clearly is going to gain wide acceptance here. In some cases, we are not going to want to let the President easily get out from underneath these requirements, which the definition of national emergency, in my view, would allow him to do. 
I also want to begin by making a point that one of my colleagues made, and that is to establish bona fides with respect to this. I have been getting a lot of calls from commercial associations seeking support for this, in the name of free trade. I have always supported fast track and do to this day, and I hope we will take fast track up again this year and pass it. I have supported GATT. I have supported NAFTA. I will proudly call myself a free trader, too. So my comments are not made from the perspective of someone who has not supported trade. In terms of business support, I certainly provided that. 
But we also have a national security obligation as Members of the Senate, and what I do not see adequately addressed in this amendment is the careful balancing between support for economic considerations on the one hand, and national security on the other. Those interests have to be very carefully calibrated. I think, with some additional work on the amendment of the Senator, we might be able to help achieve that calibration, but not if we have to vote on that today. 
Third, I mentioned the definitions problems, and I would like to get into that in detail now. I would like to read from the amendment of the Senator, the very first definition of what we are talking about when we talk about a unilateral economic sanction. Here is the definition. I am quoting: 
The term `unilateral economic sanction' means any prohibition, restriction or condition on economic activity, including economic assistance, with respect to a foreign country or foreign entity. . . 
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. 
That means foreign aid, for example. So before we do a foreign aid bill here, are we going to have to go through the requirements of this legislation? Before we reduce a country's foreign aid, is the President going to have to give the Federal Register notice for 45 days? Is the Congress going to have to wait for 45 days before we can reduce that aid? Is that reduction going to be in force only 2 years and then we would have to revisit it? Something as simple as foreign aid--we raise and lower a country's foreign aid every year for lots of different reasons. 
We may apply a little more money to the foreign aid budget and be able to increase aid, or we may reduce it and have to increase aid. It has nothing to do with whether we are trying to sanction somebody or punish somebody or prohibit trade. Yet, that would be implicated because of the breadth of the definition of `economic sanction' contained in the legislation. 
What about some of the other actions that we may take? I mentioned before export controls on sensitive U.S. technology. I think it is absolutely incredible that restrictions of U.S. trade, technical assistance, or any other way in which the United States would provide assistance to another country with respect to sensitive matters would be deemed subject to the requirements of this legislation. 
This legislation may well be appropriate for the kind of sanctions that we would apply against a country that doesn't agree with us on a particular human rights policy, for example, or something of that sort or perhaps with whom we have a trade dispute. But it certainly should not apply to the limitations that this country imposes upon U.S. businesses wanting to transfer technology to another country. There are good and sufficient reasons we have an entire regime of export controls in place. 
To show just exactly how far this legislation goes--and I think this is critical before Senators vote in favor of this amendment--they had better understand the following: We have just had exposed a tremendous technology transfer to the country of China that occurred because a couple of U.S. companies may--may; they are under investigation for it--allegedly have violated U.S. law with respect to technology transfer. 
When a missile blew up and destroyed a satellite, information was provided to the country of China. That may have been in violation of U.S. law. It may well have compromised our national security. Yet, the kind of things that we impose upon companies that are going to do business with a country like China to limit the transfer of that highly sensitive technology would be implicated because of the breadth of the definition of this legislation. 
Would we be able to limit the kind of technology transfer that has gone on to China that we are trying to stem? 
Would we be able to require defense monitors to accompany this equipment? 
Would we be able to preclude reports being issued to the Chinese Government on what went wrong with a particular launch? 
Would we be able to require an export license for the kind of satellites being exported here or the kind of technology that is being transferred in aid of the launch of U.S. satellites to make sure the rockets themselves don't blow up? 
Would we be precluded from putting those kind of technology transfers on a munitions list? 
Would we be precluded from requiring reviews by the Justice Department? 
This morning I talked with the Attorney General in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I said, `Even though you had this matter under direct investigation, pending investigation, and Sandy Berger, the National Security Adviser, was advised that it could significantly adversely impact the judicial process of the prosecution of people who would be indicted for having possibly violated the law, for the President to grant a subsequent waiver, notwithstanding that the President granted the waiver,' and I asked the Attorney General, `did you object to that in any formal way?' 
She said, `No, there is nothing in the law today that permits or requires that, and there is not even any procedure for that.' 
I said, `Do you think there should be?' 
Her answer was, `We are working right now on recommendations that would get the Justice Department into the loop here.' 
What I am saying, Mr. President, is that with regard to the transfer of highly sensitive technology that could jeopardize the national security of the United States, we do impose limitations, and as I read the definition of `unilateral economic sanction,' many of the kind of activities in which we engage here would be implicated by this definition. 
I know, or at least I firmly believe, that the Senator from Indiana would not want to jeopardize our national security and that it would not be his intention to have that kind of technology transfer limited, or the limitations on that kind of technology transfer limited by his amendment. Yet, as I read his amendment, that is exactly what occurs, because, again, the definition is:  
Any prohibition, restriction or condition on economic activity. 
Clearly, all of the things that we imposed on Loral and on Hughes are restrictions and conditions on their economic activity with China, and for a good reason: to prevent the transfer of technology that we think might harm our national security. 
Are we saying today, are we willing to vote for an amendment that essentially says, with respect to that kind of 
condition, we are going to treat that as a sanction and we are going to put all kind of limitations on whether or not it can be done? 
One of the answers is, `Well, there's a section in here that permits the President to waive any of this if there is a national security interest involved in that case.' 
Mr. President, it seems to me that we simply ought to make an initial determination that there are certain kind of things that we do not deem to be economic unilateral sanctions and they ought to be excluded in the legislation in the first instance, because otherwise we are going to have an extraordinarily cumbersome procedure where thousands of things that this Government does, in either the executive or the legislative branch, from foreign aid decisions of the Congress to highly sensitive national security technology transfer limitations, are going to be deemed to be sanctions that have to go through the processes of review and delay and sunset, and so on, of this legislation, or else be exempted by a waiver that the President would then have to specifically invoke with respect to each one of those particular actions. 
That doesn't make sense. That is why I say this one-size-fits-all kind of approach is not the right approach. The kind of things the Senator from Indiana should be dealing with are a fairly narrow range of economic activities and limitations on those activities that either the President or the Congress has imposed in the past but that don't have anything to do with foreign aid, that don't have anything to do with national security technical assistance limitations and the like. 
That is the third point I want to make. 
I should also note that there are other things that could be deemed conditions or restrictions on economic activity, like denials of visas, cuts in taxpayer-funded export credits such as from OPIC or Eximbank. Are those things implicated by this? I think clearly they are. Is that the intent of the Senator from Indiana? And, if so, how are we going to get around those with a national security waiver? There are some things that I don't think we want this to apply to for which the national security waiver isn't going to be available. There, again, the one-size-fits-all approach to this just isn't going to work. 
I will conclude this third point by reiterating what I said before. One of the things the Senator from Indiana is trying to do here is to be sure, before we invoke sanctions, we think it through, we analyze the impact, and we have a set of standards by which to measure whether it is effective or not and we have a mechanism for ending the sanction that forces us to, in effect, focus on whether or not it has been effective and we want to continue it or not. 
All of those are valid propositions. My guess is, before we are done with this, that kind of approach will be adopted by the Senate. I am not arguing against those things, but what I am doing is reiterating the argument of the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from Kentucky, and expanding on a point that I made earlier, and that is that just as we are getting into this issue with the first meeting of the sanctions task force--a bipartisan task force--yesterday to identify exactly what we want to cover by the kind of reforms and others that the Senator from Indiana is proposing, just as we are beginning this process, we have placed on the desk an amendment that is going to do it all and do it with a definition that is so broad that it would cover virtually any condition or limitation on economic activity. That is not, I think, what the sanctions task force views as the proper approach. 
I urge my colleagues to slow this process down just a little bit. We don't have to have this amendment on this appropriations bill today. I am sure that if the Senator from Indiana will work with us, if there is deemed to be a necessity to put something in place fairly soon, and certainly before the end of this legislative year, we can come up with a good set of criteria, such as those the Senator has in his bill, for imposing sanctions--a good review process, some mechanisms for revisiting the sanctions after a point in time to ensure we still want them in place. All of those things that Senator Lugar's amendment goes to I think we can include in a piece of legislation. 
But I also think we are going to want to take a look at these definitions carefully and modify them to some extent so in one case it does not go too far and embrace just too many things, and in another case it perhaps does not go far enough. 
Finally, I will close with this point, Mr. President. Sanctions--and because of the breadth of the definition of sanctions here, I think we are literally talking about any kind of action the United States might take--can be in response to all kinds of different things. 
We have the Jackson-Vanik sanctions that were imposed upon the Soviet Union when it would not allow the immigration of Jews from the Soviet Union. We have sanctions that were imposed on South Africa to try to change that country's behavior. We have sanctions that were imposed upon the Soviet Union after it invaded Afghanistan. We have sanctions in aid of various treaties or agreements that are hard to enforce unless you can impose some kind of sanction. The NPT, Non-Proliferation Treaty, and other kinds of treaties that we have signed, some bilateral, some multilateral, have to provide some kind of enforcement. 
As Senator Lieberman pointed out, you do not want to have to turn to the military option right off. So all you have are economic or diplomatic activities. Now, diplomatic activities sometimes work; sometimes they do not. They more frequently work if you have some other kind of hammer behind it, like a military or economic card to play. What it boils down to is that an economic limitation can sometimes be very important. But I do not think we ought to blame sanctions necessarily when things do not go right. 
The best example of a failed policy is one which we have all dealt with here very recently, and that is the automatic sanctions that were imposed upon India and Pakistan--for doing what?--for nuclear testing. 
Mr. President, I submit that the problem here is not sanctions per se. The problem is that the policy that was put in place was a failed policy to begin with, and to attach sanctions as the only way to respond to that was simply wrong. Congress was in error for doing that. We are now rushing to correct that error. But we are doing it in the wrong way. 
Let us understand that the problem with the sanctions on India and Pakistan go back to the fact that as a nation we should have recognized that, just like China, Russia, and France, these nations are going to do what they think is in their best national interest, which may include testing nuclear weapons, and that they are going to do that irrespective of world opinion or economic sanctions. Their own internal country opinion was more important to them. 
In both cases, they were willing to suffer the consequences economically that might result from sanctions being imposed. In fact, I think in both countries there was a certain sense of pride that they did this and that they could stand up to the rest of the world. So for us to have had to impose economic sanctions was folly. It was never going to work. These countries were going to do what they felt was in their best interest, and we were not going to be able to stop them with economic sanctions. 
All we did was hurt a couple of countries that have been friendly to the United States--in the case of Pakistan, a country that is really hurting economically. And the last thing I think we really wanted to do is hurt the people of Pakistan with these sanctions; nor did we want to hurt our own country's agricultural interests. The problem was not sanctions per se. The problem was in ever thinking that we could, by the use of something like sanctions, prevent them from doing what inevitably they were going to do. 
Let us not blame sanctions; let us blame a failed policy embraced by the U.S. Congress. Sanctions sometimes do work; and, as Senator McConnell said, sometimes they do not work. Our record has been inconsistent in this regard. I know that is one of the things that Senator Lugar is trying to address here. But that should animate our thinking here--not that sanctions are per se wrong and, therefore, they have to be used only in very, very limited situations, and so on, as some of the language in this amendment suggests. I agree with that as a general proposition. 
We ought to be careful how we use sanctions because in some cases they are never going to be effective because the underlying policy is not a valid policy. But by the same token, in the interest of satisfying our commercial constituents, I do not think we should rush to judgment here and literally throw out the baby with the bathwater by making it very difficult to impose or retain sanctions in the future when, in point of fact, there are certain areas, like national security, for example, where we very definitely want to have conditions or limitations on economic activity--the definition in the bill--that have nothing to do with the ordinary understanding of sanctions. 
For that reason, I urge my colleague from Indiana to withhold for a few days or a few hours or some point in time where we can sit down and try to rework the definitions and rework some of the other language so that we are not applying a 
one-size-fits-all solution to what is, as Senator Lieberman pointed out, a very complex situation. 
We were going to address this through the task force and take quite a bit of time to do it. If there is any reason to rush to judgment here, let us at least take enough time to narrow what we are doing and try to make it apply in a fairly restricted way to achieve whatever short-range objective we have here until we have time to think it through more thoroughly to impose a policy that would cover all of the different kinds of limitations that, as a country, we may wish to impose. 
Mr. President, I urge that this amendment not be supported, that if a motion is made by Senator Stevens, that we support that motion, and that we not consider the amendment at this time. I certainly, as a member of the sanctions task force, will work with Senator Lugar to try to take many of the good ideas he has in this legislation and pull them into a bill I think all of us can support at the appropriate time. 
Thank you.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Internal Revenue Service reform bill that is before us today. 
Mr. President, last fall, the Finance Committee held a series of hearings to expose problems in the Internal Revenue Service's dealings with taxpayers. Although we all knew that there were serious problems with the way the IRS does business, it is safe to say that all of us were truly shocked at what we learned from the hearings. 
As Senator Roth put it at the time, we found that the IRS far too often targets vulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility and arrogance, uses unethical and even illegal tactics to collect money that sometimes is not even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate employees. It is behavior that is not only unacceptable, but reprehensible. 
Madam President, the IRS reform bill begins to address the kind of problems that were uncovered by the Finance Committee's hearings. For example, it shifts the burden of proof in tax disputes from the taxpayer to the IRS, and increases penalties for IRS violations of taxpayer rights. It provides relief for innocent spouses from tax liabilities incurred by individuals from whom they have been divorced, legally separated, or living apart for at least 12 months. It provides relief in certain interest and penalty situations. And it extends greater taxpayer protection in the audit process. 
These are important changes, and they deserve our support today. There is no excuse for not reforming an agency that has too often abused innocent taxpayers. The House passed the IRS reform bill on June 25 by the overwhelming vote of 402 to 8, and my hope is that it will pass by a similarly resounding margin here. I predict that it will. 
But I also predict that even a good IRS reform bill will not solve the myriad problems that exist. Our nation's Tax Code, as currently written, amounts to thousands of pages of confusing, seemingly contradictory tax-law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless that reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the Internal Revenue Code itself, problems with collections and enforcement are likely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it does not matter what kind of personnel or procedural changes we make at the agency. Complexity invites different interpretations of the tax laws from different people, and that is where most of the problems at the IRS arise. 
Replacing the Tax Code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would facilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive IRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to lobby for complicated tax loopholes. 
There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are pending before Congress: a flat-rate income tax, a national sales tax, and the Kemp Commission's simpler single-rate tax, to name a few. Each has its passionate advocates in Congress and around the country, and any one of these options would be preferable to the existing income-tax system. 
But the fact is, there has not yet emerged sufficient public consensus in favor of a sales tax over a flat tax or some alternative. And it is likely to take a public consensus, the likes of which we have not seen in recent years, to drive a tax-overhaul plan through Congress and past the President. Realistically, it is probably going to take several more years to develop the kind of support that will be necessary to pass tax reform into law. 
Until then, we can continue to lay a solid foundation for reform. We can continue to cut taxes every year. Last year, we cut taxes for families with children, for young people trying to get a college education, and for seniors who were looking for relief from heavy death taxes and taxes on capital gains. Another modest increment of tax relief is provided in the IRS reform bill today. It will give senior citizens more opportunities to participate in Roth IRA plans. It will simplify the capital-gains tax by eliminating the 18-month holding period that was added to last year's bill at the last minute without any debate. 
Madam President, this legislation is not an end in itself. It is a step--a step in the direction of fundamental tax reform. Let us pass it and move on to the next stage in addressing the American people's desire for tax relief and a simpler, fairer Tax Code. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. KYL. I would like to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished manager of the Defense Authorization bill and several other members of the Armed Services Committee who share my concerns about the Pentagon's failure to date to respond to a requirement established first by the Committee in its action on last year's DoD bill, and then by the conferees on that legislation. 
The first of these requirements was for the Defense Department to provide a study of the contribution that the Navy's Upper Tier--or Theater Wide--anti-missile defense program, based on the AEGIS fleet air defense system, could make to protecting the United States against long-range ballistic missiles. The due date for this report was February 15, 1998. 
The conferees added to this requirement by directing the Department to report by that same date on `the feasibility of accelerating the currently planned Navy Upper Tier deployment date of fiscal year 2008' including an estimate of `the cost and technical feasibility to options for a more robust Navy Upper Tier flight test program, the earliest technically feasible deployment date and costs associated with such a deployment date.' 
Mr. President, many of us believe that the AEGIS Option may be the most expeditious, capable and cost-effective way to begin providing ballistic missile defense--not only for our forces and allies overseas but for the American people, as well. This is the case because the Nation has already spent nearly $50 billion building and deploying virtually the entire infrastructure we need to field the first stage of a world-wide anti-missile system.

Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that this study has been complete for some time--well over a month. In fact, in early May, the President's key NSC staffer in the defense and arms control field, told a public meeting that it was `in the mail.' The staffer seemed to be saying that his office as well as the Defense Department had finished reviewing it and would be providing it promptly. Lt. Gen. Lyles did brief me on the study, and he has kept a dialogue open with my staff, but our preference is to receive the report.

Mr. KYL. I am advised that the study has been objectively perfomed. As a result, it confirms what the Senator from Oklahoma and I and others have been saying for some time: The Navy's AEGIS system can contribute significantly to protecting the United States against missile attack--and do so relatively quickly and inexpensively. 
Weeks and months have now gone by, the DoD authorization bill is nearly at the end of the legislative process and the delay has kept Members in the dark about an important opportunity we have for adding promptly and cost-effectively to our Nation's defense.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for their support of the Kyl-Murkowski amendment which is intended to foster increased missile defense cooperation between the United States and our key allies in the Asia-Pacific region. 
U.S. forces and allies in the Asia-Pacific region face a growing missile threat from China and North Korea. China has embarked on a program to modernize its theater and strategic missile programs and Beijing has shown a willingness to use ballistic missiles to intimidate its neighbors. During Taiwan's national legislative elections in 1995, China fixed six M-9 ballistic missiles to an area bout 100 miles north of the island. Less than a year later, on the eve of Taiwan's first democratic presidential election, China again launched M-9 missiles to areas within 30 miles north and south of the island, establishing a virtual blockade of Taiwan's two primary ports. 
North Korea's missile program is also becoming more advanced. According to a recent Defense Department report, North Korea has deployed several hundred Scud missiles that are capable of reaching targets in South Korea. The North has started to deploy the No Dong missile, which will have sufficient range to target nearly all of Japan, and is continuing to develop a longer-range ballistic missile that will be capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii. 
North Korea's missile program shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, Pyongyang recently stated that it would continue to develop, produce, and sell ballistic missiles unless the U.S. lifts economic sanctions and compensates the regime for lost earnings from missile exports. On June 16th, the official Korean Central News Agency announced, `We will continue developing, testing, and deploying missiles. If the United States really wants to prevent our missile export, it should lift the economic embargo as early as possible and make a compensation for the losses to be caused by discontinued missile export. Our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money, which we need at present.' 
Theater missile defenses are vitally needed to protect American forces and allies in the Asia-Pacific region. This amendment would require the Administration to conduct a study of how the U.S. could best cooperate with key allies in the region such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan to establish and operate effective theater missile defenses. 
I would also note that missile defenses are purely defensive items and can only be used to intercept incoming missiles. Therefore, in may view, the sale of ballistic missile defenses to Taiwan is consistent with the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that `the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.' 
Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank Senator Murkowski for working with me on this initiative and would like to thank my colleagues again for their support of this amendment, which I hope will lay the groundwork for effective cooperation with our allies to confront a real and growing missile threat in the region.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to call attention to newly enacted legislation in my state of Arizona that stands as a model for opening electric power markets to competition and customer choice. 
Under the Electric Power Competition Act signed into law May 29 by Arizona Governor Jane D. Hull, Arizona's public power utilities must open 20 percent of their markets to competition by December 31 of this year and 100 percent to competition by December 31, 2000. 
Residents, businesses, and multi-national corporations served by companies like the Salt River Project, a public power and water utility serving 670,000 customers in the greater Phoenix area, will gain more control over where they spend their energy dollars. Customers will be able to shop for savings among sources of electricity, ultimately choose billing and metering providers, and still depend on their local utility to provide reliable electric delivery and power backup services. 
The Arizona legislation requires affected utilities to reduce rates for smaller customers at least 10 percent, as measured over a 10-year period, and caps rates for larger customers who choose to stay with their local utility. To protect consumers against deceptive marketing practices, power marketers can enroll customers only through written, signed contracts--a provision specifically aimed at stopping the notorious `slamming' and `cramming' abuses that have occurred with telephone deregulation. Strict enforcement measures are included for companies that fail to comply. The legislation also mandates that Arizona public utilities develop and pay for comprehensive public education programs to inform customers about their choices. 
While the new law does not apply to investor-owned utilities under jurisdiction of the Arizona Corporation Commission, it creates a relatively uncomplicated means for opening Arizona's entire electric market to competition. It will encourage the transition from monopoly to competitive services within a reasonable timeframe, and will allow utilities to recover costs of past investments made to meet growth needs, but that could become `stranded' in a competitive market. 
Improved services, economic efficiencies and new technologies should be among outcomes. At the same time, the legislation offers Arizona electric customers and suppliers a far less burdensome way of achieving choice than the costly plan adopted by California with effects that, so far, have slowed the development of competition. By contrast, Arizona's legislation strikes a balance between benefits stemming from free markets and the public interest in maintaining an economically secure, environmentally responsible electric infrastructure. 
Arizona's Electric Power Competition Act was passed with support of major industries, consumer groups, low-income advocates, and the state's largest investor-owned utility, Arizona Public Service Company. It puts Arizona in the forefront of the nation's move to electric competition and establishes a policy that other states would do well to consider.

The Senator just mentioned the denial, or the reported denial, of visas for three people from Radio Free Asia who, as I gather, wanted to be part of the trip to China and to accompany the President's entourage to report on defense.

Mr. KYL. Right. It seems to me--and this is the predicate for my second question--many of us are uncomfortable with some of the sanctions that we have automatically initiated. I personally have some concern about the sanctions on India and Pakistan, for example, notwithstanding the objection, of course, to what they did. The question has been asked: If not sanctions, then what? 
I remember when I was in the House of Representatives asking the question of the then-Secretary of Defense, what kind of foreign policy options do we have diplomatically, economically, militarily, and so on, if we are not going to invoke sanctions, trying to affect policies in other countries that we have deep disagreement with, including the kind of policies the Senator from Arkansas was talking about. One of his answers was that there are literally hundreds of decisions each week that are made by various Departments of the U.S. Government, as well as private entities, that have some impact on our relationships with another country. 
One of the things I recall having been mentioned was visa 
policy, for example. Now, the Chinese Government appears to be using the granting or denial of visas to make points with respect to their foreign policy. If the Senator from Arkansas is correct--and I recall the news report this morning--they are actually denying the visas of three people whom they have a beef with because they have been involved in sending signals, radio transmissions about freedom, to their country, and apparently they don't like that. One way of dealing with it is to deny the visas of these three people--at least, if I have that correct. 
My question to the Senator from Arkansas is: Is it his view that policies such as dealing with visas of people wanting to travel from another country to China are perhaps another more focused, more targeted, more sophisticated way to deal with some of these policy issues than just slapping on sanctions--although there are appropriate sanctions--depending on what the situation is?

Mr. KYL. The headline is `Beijing Pulls Visas of Three U.S. Reporters; Move Targets Radio Free Asia.' 
Deep in the article, it is noted that the three reporters were not all American citizens, but that is really irrelevant to the point here. The point is that the Chinese Government, apparently, uses the granting or denial of visas as a way to effectuate aspects of its foreign policy. It would be difficult, therefore, it seems to me, for the Chinese Government to argue that there is anything wrong with the United States Government using that same kind of visa authority to make points with respect to our foreign policy. 
My question is this: If it is United States policy that the kind of forced sterilization and abortion policy China has is inimical to the human rights and freedoms that we enjoy here in the United States and have urged upon the Chinese people, then why would it be inappropriate for the United States Government to use the very same--let me rephrase the question. What would lead us to think that the Chinese Government would have any right to object to the use of visa policy, since the Chinese Government itself has used visa policy to effectuate their foreign policy considerations? 
Why would there be any objection, per se, to the use of visa policy by the United States?

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words on the subject of telemarketing fraud. In particular, I will discuss the severity of telemarketing fraud, the House and Senate telemarketing fraud bills, and the United States Sentencing Commission's recently proposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines. 
At the outset, I would like to commend Representative Goodlatte for his sponsorship of H.R. 1847 and for his leadership in combating telemarketing fraud.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this is an article from the Washington Post by Victor Gilinsky and Paul Leventhal. Victor Gilinsky is an energy consultant, and Paul Leventhal is president of the Nuclear Control Institute. At the time of the 1974 nuclear test by India, they were, respectively, a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Senate staff. 
They write about the history of the nuclear program conducted by India, illustrating the complicity that the United States has had in the Indian program and, more importantly, the misplaced reliance that the United States has put in arms control agreements, which in the end never quite seem to bear the fruit that we had hoped for. 
In this case, it was part of the Atoms for Peace Program that the United States participated in as a result of a previous treaty, and it was part of the Atoms for Peace Program whereby the United States and Canada and other nuclear powers would provide some material for India for peaceful purposes. They had a reactor built by Canada. It was made essentially operable, according to this article, by the United States providing 21 tons of heavy water. This, of course, was all under a promise that the Indians made to the United States that the reactor would be used only for peaceful purposes. But apparently India used plutonium from this reactor in its 1974 nuclear explosion. What the authors said--I will quote: `. . .neither capital'--meaning the capital of Canada or the United States--`has uttered a peep about this matter is symptomatic of Western complicity in the South Asian nuclear crisis and of the present paralysis in dealing with it.' 
What they are pointing out is that when we negotiate a peace treaty with countries which says, `You won't develop nuclear weapons--if you will promise not to do that, then we will provide you peaceful nuclear technology,' it is almost impossible for that peaceful technology to end up in a nuclear weapons program if that is the country's ultimate desire. And, in the case of India, for whatever reasons it decided it was in its national interest to produce a nuclear weapon, apparently it used the product of this Atoms for Peace peaceful nuclear program as part of its weapon program in violation of the treaty. 
But for the United States, or Canada, or the other nuclear powers of the world to complain about this would require us to have to admit to something that we are not about to admit; namely, that these treaties don't work; that there is no way to enforce them; and that, in point of fact, a program that we had every hope would be a success--the Atoms for Peace Program--has in fact helped to contribute to the development of a nuclear weapon by the country of India. 
The article goes on to make some other points that I think are important; that is, that the country of India has broken several promises here in the development of its nuclear weaponry; that it had always complained about the charter of the new International Atomic Energy Agency in the 1950s. 
The article points out: 
It was duplicity in carrying out the Atoms for Peace agreements in the 1960's. It undermined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty with its `peaceful' bomb of 1974. 
That is referring to the fact that the Indians got around the violation by claiming that the bomb they exploded was for peaceful purposes. And apparently the United States looked the other way. 
But the article goes on to note, `Despite this history, each new generation of American policymakers thinks that by being a little more accommodating'--for countries like India--we will then gain their restraint and their acceptance of the nuclear controls that we would like to place upon them. Of course, India is not alone in this. I am not being any more critical of India than I would be of other countries that would be engaged in the same kind of conduct. 
But what this article concludes is `. . .American self-deception that stems from a mix of idealism and commercial greed.' is the reason these countries have been able to get away with this for so long--again, `. . .American self-deception that stems from a mix of idealism and commercial greed.' 
Mr. President, that is exactly what we have seen with the desire to sell virtually anything to nobody, the argument always being, if we will not sell it to them, then someone else will, which is always an excuse for transferring technology. That we have come to learn with some sadness recently. That should not have been transferred to China, for example. 
We also find this concept of idealism--that if they will just sign one more treaty, if we will just get one more commitment from a country that it won't engage in conduct that we believe inimical to world peace, that just maybe, therefore, we will have the peace that we so earnestly desire. 
The fact of the matter is that when it comes to a nation's self-defense, it is going to do what it deems in its best interest irrespective of a piece of paper, of a treaty, of a commitment, or of a promise to the rest of the world, and it is not going to be swayed by world opinion or even by the punishment that nations or organizations may mete out. 
Thus, India and Pakistan were all too willing to suffer the opprobrium of the world community. They were very--I shouldn't say `happy'--but they were willing to suffer the constraints of the economic sanctions that are automatically imposed upon them as a result of their nuclear programs and their testing, because, first of all, it is domestic politics for them, but, even more importantly, they deem it to be in their national self-interest for the preservation of their countries.  
You cannot expect a treaty that has been signed to prevent a country from doing what it believes is in its national self-interest. To think that the United States could, therefore, dissuade a country like North Korea or Iran or Iraq or one of the other so-called rogue nations of the world to forego the development or testing of nuclear weapons if only we could get everybody in the world to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is, I think, a ludicrous, self-deceptive, naive thought. 
That is why I thought the article these two gentlemen wrote and was published in the Washington Post today is so interesting, because it gives a little bit of perspective. It reminds us of how, with the best intentions, we signed treaties in the past. Part of the terms of those treaties was that we would supply atoms for peace, but when a country deemed it to be in their self-interest to use that largesse to develop their nuclear program, they did it. And after having developed their nuclear program, and this having been a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we should not find it as a surprise that they are then going to test those nuclear weapons which would, if these countries were to sign the CTBT, be a violation of that treaty as well. 
Mr. President, I conclude with this point. There has been some talk lately that the explosions of the Pakistani and Indian nuclear devices suggest it is now time for the Senate to take up the CTBT, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Exactly the opposite is true, as the distinguished majority leader of the Senate pointed out in a television interview a week ago last Sunday. He said it is 180 degrees wrong. He said the fact is that these two tests demonstrate that a test ban treaty will not have any effect on a country that deems it in its national self-interest to test these weapons; that a piece of paper is not going to stop them. 
It is interesting that in the last 2 1/2 years, during the time that the United States has had a moratorium on testing, and that we have supposedly led world opinion in encouraging other nations not to test, five nations have tested nuclear devices--probably five. We know about France and China and now India and Pakistan, and perhaps Russia. But, you see, as to verifying whether Russia actually tested at its test site in the Novaya Zemlya, we don't know for sure whether that happened, or at least we can't discuss it publicly because the means that we have for detecting those explosions is not adequate for the verification that would be called for under the CTBT. 
But we know that at least four, if not five, nations have tested, and this is all during the time that the United States has been leading the way by not testing, by having a unilateral moratorium here. The only other, of course, Great Britain, has acknowledged having nuclear weapons that it hasn't tested. 
So world opinion, leading by example, sanctions, none of these is sufficient to prevent a country from doing what it believes is in its national self-interest. As this article points out, you just cannot rely upon a treaty or a piece of paper to prevent a country from doing what it believes it has to do to protect its national security. To do so is to fall back on that great American practice of hoping against hope and of putting our reliance in idealism and in treaties when, in fact, the answer is to always be prepared with an adequate military defense. In this case, of course, the defense is the establishment of a missile defense, which we have got to get on with building. 
That is a subject for another day, but the bottom line is we can always do what we can do to defend ourselves, such as building a missile defense as opposed to putting our reliance on something over which we have no control, and that is another country's behavior, even in the face of moral condemnation by world opinion and the significant economic sanctions that might be imposed by other countries as well as the United States. 
As I said, I will put this article in the Record. I urge my colleagues who are interested in the subject to further explore it as we debate the question of whether or not the Senate should take up the CTBT. As I said, I agree with the distinguished majority leader that these tests demonstrate that putting any reliance on that agreement would be folly and therefore far from suggesting this is the time to take it up, I suggest it is time to forget about it.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to discuss today the matter pending before us, S. 1415, the tobacco legislation. It is, as we have been told by many people, one of the most expensive, complex, far-reaching legislative proposals ever considered by the U.S. Senate. The stated goal of the proposal is, of course, nonpartisan and universally recognized--the reduction of teenage smoking. We all agree on that. 
What a parent wants is for his or her children to grow up healthy and strong. No parent really desires that their children become addicted to tobacco use. The issue is, what is the best way of achieving that goal, to go about discouraging teen smoking and highlighting the dangerous health risks associated with tobacco while also preserving individual adult liberties. 
At the Federal level, I think we should also remind ourselves that underage smoking is, at this time, illegal in all 50 States by State law. I think that as the Senate considers this legislation, we should keep some fundamental principles in mind and they should be part of any legislation we should eventually adopt. 
Specifically, I think our legislation should include the following components: 
One, we should ensure that teen smoking is reduced. There are a variety of mechanisms for doing that, including making vending machines inaccessible to children, conducting an advertising campaign specifically directed toward children's tobacco use. I think we should ensure that any tobacco tax increase does not create a black market. It is very difficult to know the magic point at which you have raised the price enough to discourage its use without having, however, raised it so much that you create a black market. I think it is probably very difficult to do that, as testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee has confirmed. 
I think we need to ensure that proceeds raised by any tax increase are primarily used for health-related purposes, such as Medicare, research for NIH, reimbursement to the States for their Medicaid expenses, particularly associated with tobacco illnesses, and increasing the self-employed health care tax deduction to 100 percent. In that regard, incidentally, if there are excess moneys left over from a tax, I think we should return it to the people. We could do that, among other ways, by significantly reducing the marriage penalty which is currently built into the Tax Code, that proposal already having been made by Senator Gramm. 
I think another principle that should be embodied in this legislation is to ensure that proceeds not be used to create new, or expand existing, non-health-care-related Federal programs. One of the worst things this body could do is to impose a huge new tax ostensibly relating to tobacco use and curing its effects but, in fact, generating money to serve totally unrelated purposes, as some of our colleagues suggest. That would be wrong. 
I think another principle that should be embodied in any legislation we adopt is that attorneys involved in the litigation regarding tobacco not reap windfall profits at the expense of these education and smoking prevention programs, particularly when they are established for kids. 
Finally, I think we should ensure that no provisions are included that are virtually certain to later be adjudged to violate the first amendment's protection to speech or other constitutional provisions. 
Mr. President, the rest of the time I would like to address the link between tobacco use and drug use, especially by children, because while there has been much legitimate concern expressed about the dangers of teenage smoking--and about that, as I said, I think there is no disagreement--I think there has been insufficient attention paid to children's use of drugs and abuse of drugs and the Federal Government's responsibility to deal with that problem as well. There is an even greater danger of drug addiction, and the relationship between tobacco and drugs makes it clear that, in dealing with one, we can and should deal with the other. I think our outrage should have some perspective here, and if it does, we should all agree that drug use among children is much more dangerous than tobacco use, as bad as it is. 
Now, I noted the connection between the two. Ironically, it appears to work both ways. For example, we have known for some time that cigarette smoking is often a precursor to drug addiction. So, obviously, this is another reason to deal with the problem of youth tobacco use. For example, a survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration reported that almost 75 percent of teens surveyed had tried cigarettes before marijuana. Moreover, a 1996 national health survey on drug abuse showed that current smokers are more likely to be heavy drinkers and illicit drug users. 
Equally disturbing is the apparent innovation by youth in combining tobacco and drugs. For example, some teens are now smoking cigarettes after they smoke marijuana in order to enhance their high. I learned last night that the reason for this is that apparently the methanol in some cigarettes physiologically allows greater absorption of the THC in marijuana and therefore does prolong or enhance the high. Others hollow out cigars and replace the tobacco with marijuana in order to maintain a better high. 
This behavior illustrates the undeniable connection between tobacco and drugs. For this reason, I support linking our effort to reduce teen smoking with that expanded antidrug effort. 
I believe we have to keep in mind recent polls which show that the parents of this country are much more concerned about drug use than tobacco use. Their No. 1 fear is their children will become involved in illegal drug use. By contrast, in the May 1998 survey published by The Polling Company, a very recent survey, parental concern about juvenile tobacco use ranks No. 6 on the list. Only 3 percent of the parents cited that, whereas with respect to the No. 1 concern, drug use, 39 percent of the parents mentioned that as their primary concern with respect to their children. 
According to Centers for Disease Control research, recently speaking to the New York Times, some kids maintain an illegal drug high by using tobacco, the same point that I had made earlier. And, obviously, what this means is for these kids illegal drugs are the gateway to tobacco use, and not the reverse, as I indicated earlier. 
Drugs should be taken at least as seriously as tobacco. The two are undeniably linked. In dealing with one, we should deal with the other. I believe, therefore, that our effort to reduce teen smoking has to be tied to a renewed Federal commitment to reduce marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine use among both youth and adults. Incidentally, if we do that by a comparable amount, we will be reflecting the purpose of the Ashcroft proposal that has been presented to the Senate. 
Let us look at some of the disturbing statistics. Prior to 1992, illegal drug use by high school seniors had fallen sharply, from 30 percent in 1985 to 14 percent in 1992. This is a very important statistic, because today people say we are losing the war on drugs, we can't win it, and therefore we ought to give up. Obviously, if we had said the same thing about tobacco use, we wouldn't be engaged in this important effort today to try to reduce tobacco use. But the people who say we have lost the war on drugs are wrong because of the statistic that I just cited. Once this country became engaged in the war on drugs, particularly trying to reduce the use of drugs in schools, the use by schoolkids of drugs dropped dramatically. It was cut in half. 
Again, remember the statistics I am talking about. When we began this effort in about 1985, remember we created a drug czar's office, and Bill Bennett and others went out and campaigned fervently against drug use by kids. From 1985 to 1992, illegal drug use by high school seniors fell from 30 percent to 14 percent. So we were clearly making progress. We had made substantial progress. We were doing good. 
What happened after 1992? The process reversed. And, frankly, the reason for that is inattention, and in some cases downright hostility to the effort by the Clinton administration, and only recently reversed by the appointment of Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the drug czar. I think we can see that once we began to reassert our effort, we have begun to just barely see a little bit of progress. 
During the first Clinton administration, illegal drug use among high school students doubled. Heroin use for 8th and 12th graders has more than doubled in the last 5 years. By 1996, one in four high school seniors and sophomores reported using drugs 
in the previous 30 days; 15 percent of 8th graders reported using drugs in the previous 30 days. 
So the point of these statistics is that once we became engaged in the war on drugs, we dramatically reduced their use by kids. We cut it in half. What happened when we stopped? It went right back to where it had been. 
Equally disturbing about our inattention to this problem over the last 5 years is the fact that, as a result, drug users are getting younger and younger. A survey last year by the Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University showed that 500,000 eighth graders began using marijuana in sixth and seventh grades. As we all know, there are more victims, incidentally, in this drug use than just the user because, of course, drugs are linked to crime. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 36 percent of convicted jail inmates said that they were using drugs at the time of their offense in 1996. That was compared to 27 percent in 1989. 
So by a third we found more drug use among those people committing crimes. Moreover, 16 percent of convicted jail inmates said they had committed their offense to get money for drugs. We believe the statistics are much higher. But at least it is astonishing that that number would admit that they committed their crimes in order to get drugs. We know one in four property and drug offenders had committed their crimes to get money for drugs. And in a place like Arizona, where you have such high property crime rates, we know the strong connection between the two. In my hometown of Phoenix, for example, we lead the country in another kind of theft--postal theft by addicts in order to get money. 
According to the postal inspector, 90 percent of these thefts are committed by meth addicts. It is their preferred method of maintaining their high. 
I also note, Mr. President, that in reminding ourselves of the connection between drug use and crime, to make the point that drug use is not a victimless crime, we should also think of the individual drug user and his or her family. 
I recently held a field hearing in Phoenix primarily on the subject of methamphetamine use and the costs to society of having to clean up the meth laboratories and the environmental concerns and the dangers to people as a result of these toxic substances in their midst. But one of the witnesses was a young woman named Heather, a student, who told us about her beginning the use of drugs, starting with a free offer of drugs when she was in grade school, and working on up through the use of harder and harder drugs until, by her own words, she was a `mess' by the time she was in high school. She noted the fact that she wasn't the only person who was affected by her drug use. Her friends, her family, and, in particular, her mother were deeply affected by what she went through and what they had to bear as a result of her drug use. Fortunately, she was one of the ones who decided to try to kick the habit, and, after several difficult tries, appears now to be on a path of recovery and abstinence and of getting her life turned around. 
But it is a terrible, terrible struggle for anyone, but certainly including kids who have become addicted to drugs, to try to get off of the drugs and turn their life around. In the context of the tobacco debate, I just ask everyone to think about this for a minute. We all get used to doing certain things that we know aren't good for us. It is hard to change our habits. We all, most of us at least when you get to our age, would like to lose a little more weight. We don't like the fact that gravity has its inevitable impact on our bodies, and we begin to not quite look like we did when we were 20 years old. We would like to eat a little less and have more self-discipline about our weight. It is hard to do. We would like to discipline ourselves to do other things. It is hard to do. We get to tobacco use, and we know it really becomes hard because there are physiological addictive qualities to nicotine that makes us crave tobacco. For many people, it is very, very hard to stop using tobacco as a result of that addictive quality. But as hard as that is, it is orders of magnitude more difficult for hard drug users and even soft drug users to stop their behavior to get over their addiction. It is much, much harder. 
When you hear the story of a young woman like Heather and what she has gone through and how difficult it was for her, I think it makes it crystal clear to us that as we are focused on tobacco and because of the connection between tobacco and drugs it is also very important for us to take this opportunity at this time to also recommit ourselves to fight this war on drugs for the sake of the people who are becoming addicted to drugs every day, 
for the sake of their friends and the sake of their families, as well as the rest of us in society who end up bearing the costs of their addiction. 
Because of the seriousness of this increase in drug use by our youth, I am very troubled that the goal of the administration in its 1998 National Drug Control Strategy is not more ambitious. What is its goal? Its goal is to get us back, a couple of years after the turn of the century, to where we were when President Clinton took office. That is not only not very ambitious, but I think we could say it does not even begin to express the degree of commitment that we ought to be making. 
For the sake of the kids who at least are of junior high age today, we have to do better than that. That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Gramm-Domenici-Kyl Teenage Health Preservation Act. Let me just tell you a little bit about what the Teenage Health Preservation Act will do and why we think it is so important to be included within this tobacco legislation. 
Because of the link between underage tobacco use, illegal drugs, and crime, as I indicated earlier, we have established several important provisions in this legislation that I think get to each of those problems. 
First, we would establish a $5 billion antismoking, antidrug advertising campaign. We know that kids watch a lot of television. We know that they are susceptible to advertising. We know that there can be some very effective, good advertising telling them why they should not take on drugs or tobacco use. We would establish a five-member commission, with members nominated by the President, confirmed by the Senate, responsible for developing a comprehensive antidrug and antismoking advertising campaign. This $5 billion over 5 years would be funded out of the National Teenage Health Security Trust Fund established under the legislation. 
We also establish some antidrug and antismoking provisions and penalties, increasing, for example, by 50 percent the drug interdiction budgets of the Customs Service, Coast Guard, and the Department of Defense for activities along the U.S.-Mexican border and the Caribbean region; doubling the number of Border Patrol agents to achieve a level of 15,000 over the next 5 years; increasing the law enforcement budgets of the DEA and FBI by 25 percent; adopting the McCain antismuggling language which directs the Treasury Department to require the placement of a unique serial number on each pack of cigarettes to assist in determining the location and date of production. It would impose penalties of not less than 10 years of imprisonment for any adult who sells drugs to a minor, and a second offense would be life in prison. 
We would establish a Federal penalty of not less than 20 years for any person convicted of smuggling illegal drugs into the United States and, again, for a second offense, a penalty of life imprisonment. We would impose a fine of up to $100,000 and a term of imprisonment of up to 5 years for smuggling cigarettes into the United States. Those who would knowingly sell smuggled cigarettes to teenagers would face up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine. 
Mr. President, let me just note, some of these fines may sound very drastic, but if we are going to get serious about this problem we have to do some very different kinds of things. I don't think it is too much to say that a fine up to $10,000 and up to a year in prison is too much for people who are smuggling cigarettes and selling them to teenagers, if we are really serious about this problem. 
We would suspend Federal student loan eligibility for teenagers who use drugs or purchase cigarettes. The penalty for drug convictions would be a year's suspension of eligibility for Federal student loans, and a second offense would be a permanent loss of eligibility for student loans. For teen cigarette purchase, it would be a warning the first time around, a 6-months suspension of eligibility for the second offense, and a year's suspension for the third offense. So there would be important penalties attached to all of these. 
We would establish a Teenage Health Security block grant program to the States. The distribution of the funds is linked to State adoption of sanctions for teenage tobacco use. The States themselves need to do more to enforce their already existing laws against youth smoking. 
We would adopt the McCain requirement that warning statements on cigarette packages take up not less than 25 percent of the upper space on the pack on the front and back of each package. Importantly, as I said before, vending machine sale of cigarettes would be restricted to areas that are not accessible to children or teenagers. 
The payment that would be called for here, we think, should be capped at a per-pack amount that is estimated to be below the trigger point of significantly increased black market activity. After financing the tax reductions--in other words, the self-employed health insurance deduction that we talked about earlier--all of the remaining amounts would be deposited in a new National Teenage Health Security Trust Fund. We think the total amount of the tax that would be required in this case would be on the order of 75 cents per pack. 
We think that full deductibility of health insurance and smoking cessation programs is called for, and therefore under this legislation we would provide for an accelerated phase-in of a 100-percent deductibility of health care insurance for the self-employed, to be effective January 1, 1999. We would allow all workers not covered by an employer-provided insurance to deduct fully the cost of health insurance. This is the Roth proposal on the above-the-line deduction, so to speak. 
In addition, low-income working taxpayers who are eligible for the earned-income tax credit could take advantage of the health insurance deduction. Specifically, the cost of health insurance premiums would be excluded from their modified adjusted gross income for purposes of the earned-income tax credit. This would not apply to an individual covered by employer-provided health insurance or by Medicaid. The cost of an FDA-approved smoking cessation program would be deductible and treated as an above-the-line deduction as well. 
I mentioned the National Teenage Health Security Trust Fund in this proposal. It would finance all the programs and initiatives which are created by the legislation. The Department of the Treasury would establish an accounting mechanism necessary to ensure that the trust fund deposits and outlays are credited properly, and all expenditures from the fund would be outside the spending caps, but all would have to be appropriated on an annual basis. There would be no new entitlement or mandatory spending programs. 
No distributions or expenditures from the fund would be permitted for any purpose other than a specific authorization provided in the Teenage Health Preservation Act. Any moneys remaining in the Trust Fund after the annual appropriations process has concluded would be transferred to Medicare. 
I mention the increased funds for the National Institutes of Health. This legislation would earmark an additional $5 billion over the next 5 years from the trust fund to the NIH in addition to--in addition to--the $15.5 billion increases over 5 years already provided in our budget resolution of this year. 
With regard to the State settlements with tobacco companies, we would guarantee the right of tobacco companies and the individual States to enter into legally binding--within the border of each State--settlement agreements, including limiting liability if that is what the States negotiated.

Mr. KYL. Thank you. I will conclude with this brief description. 
The windfall profits tax on lawyers' fees that I mentioned earlier would provide, for States where there have been tobacco settlements reached, lawyer fees above $1,000 per hour but below $1,500 an hour would be subject to a surtax of 20 percent, and fees in excess of $1,500 an hour would be subject to a surtax of 40 percent. 
Bear in mind the level of fees I am talking about. While a good lawyer today might charge up to $200, $250 an hour--you know, the really superstars, maybe even $300 or $400 an hour--we are talking about $1,500 an hour here before this would kick in. But, amazingly, there are some lawyers who are getting far more than that in these tobacco settlements. 
There are some other provisions in here, but I will not go into the details in the interests of time. Also pending before us right now is the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham Drug Free Neighborhoods Act. I also strongly support that legislation. That legislation has been adequately described by Senator Coverdell a little bit earlier this afternoon. It has the drug-free teen drivers provision, the drug-free schools provision, which is very important. It emphasizes drug-free workplaces. I think it is very important for us to recognize that we are not going to be able to have drug-free workplaces if it is possible for people in this country to use drugs legally. Finally, there are key provisions for drug-free communities support. 
I might just note, too, a couple of the very specific provisions of the bill that I particularly like. It bans free needles for drug addicts and has a very important money laundering provision and a registration of convicted drug dealers. 
These are some important things that we can be doing to enhance the tobacco legislation before us to apply to the drug problem that also faces our youth today. 
We can't let this opportunity slip to address the national drug problem at the same time that we are addressing the important tobacco issue. Underage smoking is a serious problem, but smoking doesn't result in the crimes against the person and property that illegal drug use does. We have to focus at least as much attention on the problem of illegal drug use as on the problem of underage smoking. It is important to remember, Mr. President, that underage smoking represents only 2 percent of all smoking occurring in the United States. Teenage drug addiction is a critical and growing problem within this country. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I appreciate those remarks of the Senator from South Carolina who, of course, served with Senator Goldwater probably longer than anybody else in this body. 
Senator Goldwater first came to the Senate in 1952 and completed his service in the U.S. Senate in 1987. And, of course, we recall the time-out when he ran for President of the United States. But the first thing about his service to this country, obviously, for us to note is his service as a U.S. Senator, serving right here on this floor. 
Mr. President, I would like to talk about Senator Goldwater for just a few minutes this morning but focus on a couple of other aspects of his life. 
It is clear that for many of us, particularly my generation, he was an inspiration for us to become involved in politics and to approach it from what he called a `commonsense conservative point of view.' 
I remember in 1960 meeting him when I was a student at the University of Arizona in Tucson, AZ. He cared a lot about young people and was always willing to come to the university and talk to us. 
I had read the `Conscience of a Conservative' and was greatly impressed with its commonsense approach to politics at the time. Everywhere I have gone over the years--and when I have been with Senator Goldwater--I have been impressed with the fact that people from all over the country would come up to him and say, `Senator Goldwater, you're the reason I got involved in politics. Yours was the first campaign that I ever got involved in' or `It was your election that was the first time I voted.' 
He inspired Americans all over the country to become more involved in politics and, as I said, to approach politics from his commonsense conservative point of view. 
For the United States as a whole, I think our history will reflect the fact that Senator Goldwater was one of the three people who really began the modern conservative movement in this country. I think he was the first, along with Bill Buckley, providing a lot of the intellectual stimulus for the conservative movement through his publication, the National Review. And, of course, Senator Goldwater paved the way later for Ronald Reagan to become elected by the American people and to serve two terms with the tremendous conservative mandate of the American people. 
I think it is generally acknowledged that without Senator Goldwater's activity here in the U.S. Senate, and also in his activities as a Presidential candidate in 1964, that the ascendancy of the Ronald Reagan candidacy and his election by the American people would not have occurred. 
So as a result, I think those of us here in the Senate reflect not only on his service here in the Senate as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, his service and very strong support for a strong national defense for the United States, but also for being part of the beginning of the conservative movement in this country. 
I find it interesting that today most people call themselves conservatives in the same way that Barry Goldwater did all the way back in 1958, 1960, when he first came here. 
Let me talk just a little bit about Senator Goldwater in a different sense, not in the sense of a Senator in this body, not in the sense of a creator of the modern conservative movement in this country, but rather as the individual, because in Arizona a lot of people know Barry Goldwater a little bit differently, a lot of people whom no one else knows. They are not the big important people of the world, they are people who grew up with Senator Goldwater. They are Navajo Indians whom he got to know when he helped to run his family's trading post on the Navajo Indian reservation. They are people all over the State with whom he visited when he traveled the State, hiked it, and photographed it. There are veterans he visited with, people in the military all over the country, but particularly in Arizona, with whom he was very closely associated. These are the people Barry Goldwater would reminisce with me about when I went to his home and visited with him, long after his Government service came to an end. 
In fact, when I went to his house to visit with him, I expected him to talk about Senate business and get advice from him about what we should be doing here. He didn't want to talk about that. He wanted to reminisce about people he had known way back when--the people who really mattered to him most. They weren't kings, they weren't presidents, and they weren't Senators; they were regular folks from whom he took a great deal of learning. 
If you read `Conscience of a Conservative' again, and even if you review the speech that he gave when he accepted the party's nomination in 1964 to run for President, you will see throughout a strong reference to the economic sense of people and the nature of people. He talked, in `Conscience of a Conservative,' about the inherent nature of people, and he criticized some of his liberal friends for wanting to remake people in their image, basically, through Government action. His point was, look, people are the way God made them, for better or for worse; we should recognize that human nature and formulate Government policies to help permit people to live as they would as human beings, without trying to have Government make them into a particular type of person or to direct their activities in a particular way. That is why he became known as the great friend of freedom. 
He was a person who did not believe Government should tell people what to do or even shouldn't tell people a great deal, because it would prevent them from helping to learn themselves. He understood human nature. How did he come to that understanding? Part of it is because he really liked people and he liked to be with people. He learned from them what it was that was the essence of the character of man. 
I think a lot of that began, as I said, when he was living on the Navajo Indian reservation, tending to his family's trading post. The photographs he has taken, particularly in his early life, frequently are commented upon as remarkable for capturing something very special, some inner quality of the people he photographed. A lot of the people he photographed were on the Navajo Indian reservation and the Hopi Indian reservation. I have one of his photographs hanging in my office of a young Navajo girl. There is something very, very special about that. Every one of the photographs that he took of the 
people, you almost feel that you know that person, that it is a very special person. There is sort of an inner quality that comes out in his photographs. 
How did he do that? He didn't have the greatest camera equipment at the time, although he has always been a fine photographer. He was somehow able to capture the essence of people through his photography. I think part of it is because he got to know the people and he would talk to them and ask them very nicely if they would mind being photographed. He was able, therefore, to capture that essence of humanity that I think most of us miss. We are all too busy, too busy with the big important things in life. 
Barry Goldwater focused a lot on the little things in life, which is another reason he was such a great photographer of Arizona landscape. He found beauty in places that many of us would have passed over because we were in a hurry. Now we reflect on those photographs and think, how could anyone have captured that the way he did? Some of which, incidentally, Mr. President, are very valuable because they show, for example, trips down the Grand Canyon in areas that are now dammed up and we will never see them the way he saw them and the way the photographs captured them. 
My point here is that in recent years when I visited with Senator Goldwater, I learned a lot more from him about people than I did about political philosophy and what we should be doing with these great momentous decisions here that we debate on the Senate floor. In this respect, Senator Goldwater was a lot like my own father, who also had the privilege of serving in the U.S. Congress, representing the State of Iowa. He, too, is a great photographer. And he, too, sees that something special in people and in places that he has been able to photograph. He, too, thinks a great deal about individual people and what they meant. And he, too, likes to reminisce about people in his earlier years. 
I suppose that happens to all of us when we get a little bit older, but part of it is because not only do we remember those people, but we reflect, now, upon an entire life and we understand what is important and what isn't. We understand that part of what is really important about life is the people we got to know and what we have learned from them. I learned a great deal from my father, just as I have from Senator Goldwater, about human nature. I think that knowledge is better for us as public servants than any other schooling we could get or any other studying we could do. 
In reflecting on Senator Goldwater's life after he passed away on Friday, it just occurred to me that the things I want to share about him are these reflections about the individuals he knew and what he learned from them, something that probably will not be greatly commented upon by others who will reflect upon his service here in the Senate, his strong support for national defense, his creation of the modern conservative movement--as I said, his leading of that movement through much of the period of the 1960s. All of that was very, very important. That is why he will go down in the history books as a great American leader, as a great American patriot. 
But as I said, he was also, to me, a teacher. One of the reasons for his greatness was the fact that he understood the importance of the little things in life, the little things that create beauty, the little things that make us all what we are. I think if more people understood that human nature as Senator 
Goldwater did, because he experienced it so much in his early life, that all of us in this body and in the other body would be much better representatives of the people for whom we work, because we would better understand their desires, their hopes, their needs, and perhaps would better be able to reflect those hopes, needs, and desires in the kind of policy that we help to set here in Washington, DC. 
A final point in closing, Mr. President. Senator Goldwater, of course, was very blunt and outspoken. I think a little bit of that would go a long way these days, too--to say what we really think, irrespective of the political consequences. Now, some have said he could afford to do that because in 1964 he was running a race that he couldn't win and so he had the luxury, in effect, of just saying what was on his mind. If you know Barry Goldwater, he didn't just limit it to the 1964 campaign; he said what was on his mind, regardless of the circumstances, when he was beginning in politics and all the way through to the day he died. 
All of us, I think, could benefit by trying to be a little bit more candid in how we express ourselves. He and Ronald Reagan, I think, found the same thing. When you do that, it is surprising how appreciative people are and how politically popular, sometimes, you can be by simply saying what is on your mind. People understand when you are politicking versus when you are talking from the heart. It is not hard for people to see through what most of us say. That is why a lot of politicians do not have very good reputations. I think if more of us reflected on the way Barry Goldwater did it, we would find it is not only a more candid approach but it also can have very good benefits for people to see that all of us are willing to express ourselves in a very candid and a very open way. 
So he has taught us a great deal. I think as people put the parts of his life together, it all fits together in a mosaic that created a unique individual. We will find additional lessons to take from his long and very productive life. I am looking forward, Mr. President, to visiting with other Members of this body to learn of their experiences with Senator Goldwater, because of course I didn't have the opportunity to serve with him. 
In the time that he was here, Senator Goldwater, I think, represented Arizona in a way that permitted those of us in Arizona to refer to him as Mr. Arizona, 
a person who reflected really a great deal about our own State. Mr. President, it is from that standpoint that I approach, not with a great deal of sadness, but rather with some degree of celebration, the fact that he was able to serve in this body so long, to represent the State of Arizona for so long, to be really reflective of our State, and he will go down in the history books not as a great national and international figure, but probably as the most important and famous Arizonan, at least in my lifetime, and someone who I think all of us in Arizona were proud to have as a representative of our State. 
I am looking forward to joining many of my colleagues Wednesday in Phoenix at his funeral which, as his wife told me, will be more of a celebration of his life and of all of the things that he did, both for his State and for this country. I am sure we will hear a lot of stories and do a lot of laughing about Barry--and a lot of crying about the fact that he is gone. But the fact of the matter is that we have an opportunity to reflect on an individual who we have loved very much, and we want to make the most of that opportunity. 
Mr. President, I wanted to come here this morning to give a few reflections, not in the usual vein of his political accomplishments and what he did as a Senator, but more what I saw in him, especially in his later years, as an individual who just wanted to be remembered as an honest man. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First of all, let me say that I think it is a good thing that we are finally beginning to spend gas tax money on the purpose for which the tax was collected in the first place; namely, our highway and transit systems in this country. But I don't think it is a good thing that there are winners and losers in the process depending upon who you are. 
Mr. President, I have a hard time justifying this legislation to my constituents in Arizona who continue to ask me why it is that the fastest growing State in the country that sends $1 to Washington in gas tax continues to get less than $1 back. As a matter of fact, because we are a Western State, there is also supposed to be some consideration given to the fact that the wide open spaces require more highways, as is the case with many of the other Western States. But it is not to be. Instead, historically Arizona has gotten 86 cents on the dollar. And, under the original Senate bill, we were supposedly guaranteed that Arizona would receive the generous sum of 91.5 cents on the dollar. It now turns out that it will be 90.5 cents on the dollar. 
Mr. President, I am not here asking that Arizona receive something extra, unlike a lot of the people who are still negotiating in the cloakroom here. I am not asking for money for special projects. But I am asking why it is that the donor States--the States that send more than they receive--can't eventually hope to get some equity in this program. What we are doing here is locking in for 6 years a continued unfair program for the 18 or so States that contribute more than they receive. 
Mr. President, this reminds me a little bit of the `Animal Farm' story of George Orwell of 1946. It turns out that all the animals in the barnyard were equal, except that some were more equal than others. That is the way it is with the States of the Union here. 
As I said, you have a fast-growing Western State like Arizona, the fastest in the country, that receives, or would receive under this legislation, 90.5 cents for every dollar sent to Washington. 
How will some of the other States make out? The majority leader pointed out that Senator Stevens would probably be pretty happy with what Alaska got under the bill. Instead, I would be happy if I got $5-plus for every dollar that I sent, which is what Alaska will receive. I would be happy if I were in Connecticut and I got $1.52 for every dollar I sent; or Delaware, $1.54. These are very small States, by the way. Montana, a large State--we are supposed to get a little extra consideration for the size--gets $2-plus back; my fellow Western States of New Mexico and Nevada each get more than $1 back--$1.14 and $1.18, respectively. The Senator from West Virginia, his State receives $1.41 back. Another small State, Vermont, $1.76; South Dakota, $2; Pennsylvania, $1.20. 
It turns out that who you are matters more in this process of deciding how this money that everybody in the country pays-- that matters more than equity. 
Once we have an opportunity to review the bill--there has 
been one copy available, and everybody has had to try to sort through that one copy--I think there are going to be a lot of criticisms of how this money was allocated. There will also be a lot of questions asked, many of which have been raised here already. 
How about the offsets? This is all supposed to come out equally, so that we are not spending more than we are taking in. As the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, we are now going to use the more generous OMB figures than the CBO figures which we have always insisted on using in the past because we think they are more accurate. That would permit us, in effect, to exceed the budget caps. 
There is a significant question of the appropriators' authority, which Senator Stevens raised. There are questions about the earmarks. As far as I can tell from the information I have, they don't add up. When the bill left the Senate, the formulas for the individual State projects called earmarks were supposed to be included within the State's formula allocation. But apparently that is not true under this bill, at least to the extent of $200 million; I don't know beyond that. 
Mr. President, probably the most distressing thing about this is that most of the Senators who are going to vote on this will not know what is in the bill, and, therefore, they may have a bit of a hard time explaining to their constituents later on when problems are raised why they were in such a hurry to vote on this. 
We lose nothing by waiting until we have an opportunity to review this. There is authority for States to continue to spend and charge it against this allocation. That has expired. We can extend that for another 10 days, until we get back. 
But this bill is over $200 billion, one of the largest spending bills that this Senate, this Congress, will have ever authorized, and yet we don't know most of what is in the bill. 
As I said, what I do know I don't like, because it appears that once again a few States are being discriminated against in order that other States, which are represented heavily on the committees that make the decisions, will get more than their fair share. 
Mr. President, I regret to have to be this critical, but I think it has to be said very plainly. 
When I have an opportunity to find out a little bit more about it, as the staff is now being made available to us--they have been very busy working all through the night, as I understand it, trying to get this finally negotiated--as they are made available to us, we will be able to understand some additional information about this. I intend to then return and comment some more. 
But I did want to make the point right now that I think this is not a good process. We are hurrying too much. We are spending too much. We aren't going to be able to offset this, probably, under the estimates that have been provided. There are too many questions. And the numbers don't add up. To the extent that the States that are making contributions in excess of the amount that they receive back and are hoping to receive some ultimate relief, it appears that we are locked in for a 5- or 6-year period and that is not to be and, therefore, that our citizens will continue to be discriminated against. 
Mr. President, for all of those reasons I am going to be very disappointed to have to change the vote I cast when I supported this bill earlier because I thought we were making progress in changing the formula. I wanted to assist our leadership in moving toward the concept that the gas tax dollars will at least be spent on highway and transit needs, that I will reluctantly have to vote no on this and just hope in the future, in the interests of States that are donor States here, that we can get a more equitable distribution of these funds.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I just noted, there are actually two parts of this legislation. One of them has to do with the implementation of the chemical weapons treaty which was ratified in the Senate last year. 
The legislation passed about a year ago. It was finally dealt with by the House, and comes back to us. I do not know of any objection to it. And I will not take the time to summarize it except to say that in general terms it makes it a crime for Americans to produce or use or manufacture these chemical weapons. 
It provides protections for American citizens and businesses in terms of search and seizure and takings, so that with respect to the inspection regime that is established under the treaty, there is protection of American citizens' constitutional rights, and if anyone has a question about that legislation, I am prepared to try to answer that today. 
But by far and away the issue that is before us today of most interest to Members is, of course, the Russian missile assistance to Iran. The majority leader spoke eloquently on the patience that the Senate has exercised in withholding action on this important legislation until this time. 
But there does come a time when, as the majority leader said, the Senate does have to finally act here. We believe that by passing this legislation, it will actually have a positive impact on the leadership of Russia which has had a very difficult time ensuring that the assistance provided to Iran is stopped. 
Now, one might say, `Well, that doesn't make a lot of sense if it is the policy of the Russian Government that this assistance not be transferred to Iran.' But the fact of the matter is, it is difficult for the Russian Government, as the majority leader said, to ensure that there is no transfer of technology or material to the Iranian missile program. 
When confronted with evidence that this has occurred, in some cases the Russian Government appears to have tried to take action against it; in other cases, as the majority leader said, that has not happened. So this legislation should provide a basis not only for the United States to specifically direct attention to the matter, but also for the Russian Government to have a very specific basis for enforcing its laws and policies against the providing of such technology to Iran. 
Mr. President, let me just outline in very brief terms some of the open-source information about the kind of technology and other assistance that has been provided by Russian firms, individuals, and other entities to the Iranian program. 
One of the Russian ICBM missiles--or at least intermediate-range missile--is called an SS-4 in our terminology. And important missile components and instructions of how to build that missile have been sent to the Iranians. 
This is important because this missile has a much greater capability than the one that is most likely to be produced soon. This missile, in the Iranian term, is called the Shahab-4. It would have the capability of reaching cities in Europe, Mr. President. So it is not just a regional weapon, but a weapon that will challenge countries in Europe as well as in the Middle East. That weapon, according to open-source material, could be deployable within as little as 3 years. 
In addition to that, construction of a wind tunnel for missile design and manufacture of missile models, and even the sale of missile design software has occurred. 
Moreover, missile guidance and propulsion components, as well as the necessary advice and equipment to produce these components in Iran has been provided. In that sense, Mr. President, let me note that it is not Russians who are actually building these missiles for the Iranians, it is Russians who are providing much of the material and the assistance and the technology for the Iranians to do it themselves. So they will have an indigenous capability. 
In addition, more than one special metal alloy which Iran can shape into missile casings and even alloy foil in thin sheets used to shield guidance equipment had been provided, in one case, according to open-source material, was stopped in another country after it left Russia. 
Training of Iranian technicians at Russian institutes and the recruitment of top Russian missile specialists to work with Iran has all occurred within the most recent months or years. 
As I said, the Iranians are using this technology to produce two missiles: One we call the Shahab-3, the other the Shahab-4. The Shahab-3 has a 1,300-kilometer range roughly, depending upon what kind of warhead is included on it, and is capable of targeting Israel, as well as other targets in the Middle East. According to open-source material, development of this missile could be completed in 12 to 18 months. 
I mentioned the Shahab-4, which is capable of reaching Central Europe, and the fact that development could be completed in 3 years. 
Mr. President, since the Senator from Connecticut, I think, is preparing to speak, let me just summarize one other aspect of this assistance; that is the Russian nuclear assistance to Iran, not specifically the target of this legislation, but of equal concern to us. 
Russia has assisted Iran in a number of ways, including a contract to construct a nuclear reactor and a deal to provide nuclear fuel for the reactor for 20 years, and to take back spent fuel for reprocessing. It has agreed to train Iranian nuclear technicians to operate the plant, to construct three additional reactors when the first contract is complete. 
In 1995, in response to U.S. pressure, Russia agreed to limit the scope of nuclear cooperation with Iran and canceled plans to sell gas centrifuge enrichment technology, and heavy water moderated reactors. 
However, Russia has exceeded the limits it agreed to place on its nuclear cooperation with Iran. According to an article in July 1997 by The Washington Post, the United States intelligence reports `document[ed] a series of high-level technical exchanges between Russia and Iranian engineers,' which covered matters beyond the Bushehr reactor, including advice on how to mine and process uranium. 
Finally, Mr. President, just this month, The Washington Times disclosed that U.S. intelligence reports indicate that Iranian nuclear officials were negotiating to purchase tritium from Russia and were slated to view a demonstration of gas centrifuge technology used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons during a visit to Moscow later this month. 
At a meeting just last week, we specifically asked the Russian Ambassador if he would try to see to it that that demonstration project was not held because its only purpose is to assist the uranium nuclear program. He indicated personally a desire not to see that meeting go forward, but we will see whether it does. 
Tritium, which I mentioned, is, of course, important for the boosting of nuclear weapons and would be an important way for the Iranians to make a nuclear technology more robust than it might be otherwise. These are serious matters. 
The Russian Government, whether complicity or simply negligence, has not been able to stop the transfer of these materials and this technology. The United States cannot simply sit by and hope for diplomatic actions to work. In the Senate and the House, we recently passed money for a supplemental appropriations bill which will be applied to both Israeli theater missile defense systems and the U.S. theater missile defense systems so we may at an earlier day be able to meet the threat that the Iranian missiles might pose. 
There may be a window of vulnerability. That is why it is important for us to try to slow down and stop the assistance that Russia is providing to Iran. This is very important legislation. I hope our colleagues will support it strongly, sending a strong signal to Russia that it should not be providing or allowing to be provided this important technology to Iran. 
I yield whatever time the Senator from Connecticut desires.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is a reason why this bill picks August 8, 1995, as the date after which Russian companies should be sanctioned for their proliferation behavior. The reason for this is very simple: August 8, 1995, was the date upon which Russia joined the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). In so doing, the Russian Government undertook an international obligation to curtail its proliferation behavior. Unfortunately, as we have seen, the Government has not lived up to that pledge. 
At the time that the United States favored Russian membership in the MTCR, the Senate was assured by the Clinton Administration that Russia had all of the necessary, effective export controls in place. Well, we see just how accurate that claim proved to be. Two years later the United States began uncovering evidence of the degree to which Russian assistance has sped up Iran's missile program. 
In retrospect, clearly the United States should have waited until an effective, Russian export control regime had been established before favoring Russian membership in the MTCR. As an aside, I hope the Clinton Administration will learn from this experience. There has been a great deal of talk lately about encouraging China to join the MTCR. I would hope that the United States would wait an appropriate period of time to see whether China's export controls are truly effective enough to warrant membership in the MTCR. 
Finally, I have reservations about the Levin amendment, because it seeks--at a minimum--to `grandfather' Russian missile proliferation activities before January 22, 1998. But I will not oppose this amendment because, among other things, proliferation on the part of these companies has been so rampant even since January 22, 1998 that few companies in Russia, if any, will benefit from this shift in dates.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act. Business, professional associations, and various governmental entities have presented convincing evidence of the need to raise the current 65,000 annual cap on H1-B workers. It is also true that there is significant conflicting evidence, which is why I believe the requirement in the bill for a non-biased report on high-technology labor needs is one of the most important provisions of the bill. 
Over the past two years I have heard from numerous employers from around the state of Arizona, including such major employers as Intel Corporation, Motorola, the TRW, who have provided evidence and anecdotes about why more H1-B workers are needed. For example, TRW tells about a foreign student it hired from an American university because the foreign student was the only individual who could produce a formula to redesign a component of the `air-bag' to make it safer and better designed. If TRW had not been allowed to hire the foreign student, it believes it would still be searching for an engineer to perform the job. 
This year and last, the 65,000 annual ceiling on H1-B workers has been reached. That means that for the next four months, until the end of the fiscal year, employers who cannot find American workers to perform certain specialty jobs, including computer programming, engineering, and other high-technology positions, will not have that work performed until the 1999 fiscal year begins, this October 1. For anyone who has ever run a business and experienced worker shortages, they know that not being allowed to hire necessary personnel can be devastating. 
I support an increase in the cap for this year. I also support a short term increase, for five years, in the number of aliens granted H1-B visas. With the increasing number of high-technology jobs, including positions related to the Year 2000 problem, and, until this year, a decreasing number of students studying in high-tech-oriented majors, employers will be challenged in the near term to find enough qualified workers. 
Having said this, however, I reiterate that there are conflicting issues surrounding the H1-B foreign worker debate that must be examined and addressed at the end of the five-year authorization. When the full Judiciary Committee considered S. 1723, the Judiciary Committee accepted my provision to limit the authorization to five years and require that various interests on both sides get together and issue a non-biased report within two years of enactment of the bill about labor market needs over the next ten years for high-technology workers. This study and report, to be overseen by the National Science Foundation, will include representatives with varying interests for academia, business, and government, and, among other issues, will assess the future training and education needs of American students to ensure that their skills match the needs of the IT industry over the next 10 years. It will also provide an analysis of progress made since 1998 by educators, employers, and government entities to improve the teaching and educational level of American students in the fields of math, science, computer and engineering. 
The report, and the requirement that the authorization be limited to five years, is clearly necessary. My office has been inundated with information from government agencies, the high-technology industry, and professional associations that represent particular high-tech industries. But the information has been inconsistent. For example, information we received from the Commerce Department indicates that the United States is currently experiencing a significant high-technology worker shortage and over the next 10 years, the U.S. will generate more than 100,000 information-technology jobs annually. An interest group study, conducted by Virginia Tech, found that there is a current vacancy rate of 346,000 high-technology positions in the United States. The Labor Department projects that our economy will produce more than 130,000 information-technology jobs in each of the next ten years, for a total of more than 1.3 million positions. The Hudson Institute estimates that the unaddressed shortage of skilled workers throughout the U.S. will result in a five percent drop in the growth rate of GDP. 
On the other hand, information provided for the General Accounting Office about the Commerce Department's assessment of information-technology shortages indicates that the Commerce report contained serious methodological weaknesses. The GAO, however, also found that its assessment should `not necessarily lead to a conclusion that there is no shortage. Instead, as the Commerce report states, additional information and data are needed to more 
accurately characterize the IT labor market now and in the future. 
The GAO report also provided Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates on projected growth for high-technology jobs and found that, compared to the expected 13 percent growth in other jobs by the year 2005, IT occupations are expected to grow 60 percent over the same period. 
Increasing wages of IT workers and the unemployment rate of IT workers also signal shortages in the IT field. But in these areas, there is also conflicting information. For example, reports conducted by consulting and interest groups found that salaries for IT workers rose higher than for other specialty occupations in 1996 and 1997. But, according to the GAO, the percentage changes for the IT industry over the period between 1983 and 1997 were comparable to, or lower, than other speciality occupations. Such statistics may support the high-technology sector's anecdotal evidence that demand, relative to other occupations in a period of relatively low unemployment, has grown substantially over the past couple of years. 
There are also anecdotal stories in leading newspapers about the difficulty American college graduates are experiencing trying to enter the high-technology job market. But, statistics about specific high-tech professions paint a different picture. For example, the unemployment rate among electrical engineers nationally is below one percent. Anecdotal evidence points toward one assessment but statistics seem to point toward high demand for these U.S. workers. 
So, the required repot will serve as an important tool in the reauthorization of the H1-B program, but regardless of the outcome of the report, it is very important for the private sector and for government, all the way up to the Executive Branch, to encourage young people to be fully prepared, first, for job markets where there is an abundance of jobs and, second, for the very jobs that will keep America strong and competitive on a global basis. To that end, I am supportive of the bill's provision to authorize $50 million in scholarships for low-income students pursuing degrees in math, engineering, and science. It is my hope that the provision, coupled with related provisions in the Senate-passed job-training consolidation bill and the National Science Foundation reauthorization, will help young people go into high tech fields. 
There are other aspects of this legislation that I want to highlight. As foreign workers continue to be admitted into the American workforce, and as the five-year reauthorization progresses, I will work with the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to scrutinize which workers really make up our population of H1-B workers. Let's make sure that the H1-B program only admits those workers who will perform a `specialty occupation' as defined by the Immigration and Nationality Act, including the following; the individual possesses unique knowledge or skills; the individual can localize a product based on native knowledge of language or culture of the foreign market; the individual will contribute to a company's global presence; or, an employer finds an inadequate number of highly qualified American workers to fill the job. 
In addition, it is important to understand the dynamics by which H1-B employees come to stay in the United States permanently, instead of returning home after the six years they are authorized to work in this country under the visa. While it is true that in 1990, immigration reforms made it possible for H1-B workers to, with `dual intent,' enter the United States on an H1-B visa and then remain in the United States permanently, I believe it is important to know how many immigrants are entering the United States on an H1-B visa and then staying here permanently. 
Finally, it is very important that the Labor Department respond to questions posed in March by Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Spencer Abraham about abuses in the H1-B program. It is important to understand why the number of complaints about the H1-B process are so few. I support the provisions of the bill that increase penalties to $25,000 per violation and provide for a two-year debarment from the H1-B program for employers who willfully violate the law, but we need to know more about whether or not a substantial number of employers do or do not violate H1-B immigration law. 
Mr. President, I will support passage of S. 1723. Companies in the United States must not be impeded from hiring needed employees. I look forward to a comprehensive assessment of high-technology employer needs from the report included in the bill and to critically applying that assessment when we look at and reauthorize the H1-B program in five years.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill to transfer title to the Wellton-Mohawk Irrigation and Drainage District in Yuma, Arizona from the Federal Government to the project beneficiaries. The repayment obligation for construction costs was fully satisfied as of May 30, 1987. This bill is the product of intensive negotiations between the project beneficiaries and the Bureau of Reclamation and will be the subject of a hearing in the Water and Power Subcommittee on June 9. At that time, I will hear from all interested parties about how to successfully complete this project transfer. 
As you may know, Mr. President, numerous project transfers have been proposed, both in this session of Congress and the 104th Session. Thus far, none have been completed. With this bill, we in Arizona hope to reverse that trend. In March of this year, I met with Patty Beneke, Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Water and Science, and Bob Johnson, Regional Director for the Bureau of Reclamation, and they assured me that the Wellton-Mohawk project was a perfect example of the kind of project that should transfer under the administration's 1995 Framework for Transfer. I believe Bob Johnson referred to this project as `low-hanging fruit.' I assume by that, he meant that it could transfer quickly and easily. I hope this is the case. 
The Wellton-Mohawk project is located in Yuma County, Arizona and irrigates approximately 63,000 acres of prime agricultural lands. This irrigation district is a major contributor to the economy of Yuma County--the largest agriculturally developed county in Arizona--and posts approximately three-quarters of a billion dollars in annual agricultural sales. Transfer of title from the Federal Government will affect neither the productivity nor the efficiency of the irrigation district. I believe that transfer would only enhance the District's productivity. 
Both sides stand to benefit from this title transfer. The District looks forward to a reduction in Federal Government involvement; would benefit from better land-management opportunities; and would have the opportunity to assure increased protection of the environmental values of the Gila River riparian habitat. The Federal Government benefits, too. A successful title transfer would advance the administration's stated goal of reduction in government as well as eliminate the responsibility for managing the patchwork of lands that make up the District. The Bureau of Reclamation would be relieved of the administrative and financial burden of facilities oversight currently required due to Federal ownership. 
In negotiations, the Bureau of Reclamation has raised several issues that need to be addressed in order to effect a successful transfer. These issues include environmental mitigation, administrative costs, identification and valuation of lands, and agricultural return flows. One of the benefits of my legislation is that it provides a Memorandum of Agreement, to be negotiated between the Bureau and the District, that will address all of these concerns in an open and mutually beneficial process. 
I am pleased thus far by the cooperation of all stakeholders. I look forward to continuing the process at the Water and Power subcommittee hearing on June 9, 1998. I thank Senator McCain for his cosponsorship of this bill, and I look forward to his support, as well as that of the rest of my colleagues, on this measure.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a section in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that I am particularly proud of, and that is the law enforcement exception in the bill. At the Judiciary Committee markup, Senator Grassley and I, along with the assistance of Chairman Hatch and Senator Ashcroft worked to strengthen the law enforcement exception in the bill. We received input on the language from the copyright community and the administration: the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Departments of Commerce and Justice, and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
The law enforcement exception ensures that the government continues to have access to current and future technologies to assist in their investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I am concerned that the tools and resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities are preserved--and more importantly, not limited, by passage of S. 2037. Under that bill, a company who contracts with the government can continue to develop encryption/decryption devices under that contract, without having to worry about criminal penalties. 
Because much of our leading technologies come from the private sector, the government needs to have access to this vital resource for intelligence and law enforcement purposes. 
The law enforcement exception recognizes that oftentimes governmental agencies work with non-governmental entities--companies, in order to have access to and develop cutting edge technologies and devices. Such conduct should not be prohibited or impeded by this copyright legislation.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. President, the administration's position on defending the American people is essentially twofold: One, wait until there is a threat; and, two, we will then develop a defense. There are two things wrong with this approach: First, as the Indian nuclear testing has just demonstrated to us, we won't necessarily know when there is a threat. In fact, we always seem to underestimate the threat. Secondly, it always seems to take longer than we anticipate to develop complex systems, and this is particularly true with respect to missile defenses. 
So the legislation introduced by the Senator from Mississippi is a much better idea, to protect the American people, Mr. President. It simply says that it is our policy to deploy a national missile defense as soon as it is technologically possible. 
Now, what could be more straightforward and more protective for the American people? The American people demand no less. 
I would note that the argument of the Senator from North Dakota just a moment ago illustrates, I believe, the lack of ideas to oppose this simple legislation of the Senator from Mississippi. His primary argument was that we need to continue research because, after all, there are other threats, too, like the suitcase bomb. Of course, there are other threats. And our position has always been to prepare to defend against all of the threats but not to ignore one very big threat just because there are other threats as well. 
There have been other charges that the adoption of the American Missile Protection Act is somehow going to wreck arms agreements that the United States has entered into. First, there is the complaint about the ABM Treaty that we heard which is particularly puzzling since the words, ABM Treaty don't appear anywhere in this legislation. The bill doesn't require any violation of the ABM Treaty as a matter of fact. It doesn't specify the number of sites, where they would be, or what kind of interceptors or missiles we would have. So that argument is specious. 
Secondly, we have heard the argument that if the United States decides to deploy an NMD even against limited threats, the Russians will refuse to ratify START II or negotiate START III. How many times do we have to pay for START II? I count about eight different things that the Russians have said we have to do in order for them to ratify START II or fully implement START I or START II. And we could list those but I am going to put them in the Record. 
The point is the United States needs to take its defense into its own hands. We cannot simply rely upon a piece of paper with another country, particularly where in the case of, first, the Soviet Union, and now Russia, after that piece of paper is signed--and remember we are putting our safety in the hands of people across the sea who have signed that piece of paper with us--we find that they have changed their mind and tell us that they can't implement that piece of paper until we do other things. 
First of all, it was that we had to address concerns regarding NATO expansion and then the CFE Treaty had to be modified. Then they could not afford to dismantle their weapons, and on and on and on. The point here is we should not place our reliance upon pieces of paper signed with other countries but upon what we can do for ourselves to protect the American people. 
We heard the argument that the United States must refrain from exercising our rights under the ABM Treaty to deploy even a limited missile defense lest we upset the Russians, the same Russians who operate the world's only current ABM system. Should we take from this suggestion that the Russians have a right not only to defend themselves but to insist that we do not? And yet that is precisely what the opponents of this legislation are saying. 
Mr. President, the defense of America should not be subject to a Russian veto. Linking the deployment of national missile defenses to some hoped-for arms control agreement is to be expected from the Russians, but it is unconscionable to be offered by Representatives of this Congress. Arms control for the sake of arms control is not in the national interest, and the Constitution does not allow us to substitute pieces of paper for the real measures which must be taken to protect America. 
Then there is an argument that committing to deploy an ABM system will cause the sky to fall on offensive arms control agreements. Let me quote the Senator from Michigan on this issue: 
Nothing in this bill says that the national missile defense system that it commits us to deploy will be compliant with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. That is a treaty, a solemn agreement between us and Russia. If we threaten to break out of that treaty unilaterally, we threaten the security of this Nation because that treaty permits Russia to ratify the START II agreement and to negotiate a START III agreement, reducing the number of warheads that they have on their missiles and warheads that could also potentially proliferate around the world and threaten any number of places, including us. 
This statement is incorrect in several ways. First, the ABM Treaty is not a `solemn agreement between us and Russia.' The ABM Treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet Union. That country no longer exists, and the administration spent four years in negotiations to see who would replace the Soviet Union as parties to that treaty. The President has certified that he will submit the results of those negotiations to the Senate for advice and consent. When and if the Senate agrees, then the ABM Treaty may become `a solemn agreement between us and Russia,' but not until then. 
Second, S. 1873 does not require `break out' from the ABM treaty. In fact, as I have already pointed out, it allows for deployment of exactly the system being developed under the administration's so-called 3+3 program. And there is nothing in any legislation that calls for that system to be treaty compliant. To the contrary, a non-compliant system is explicitly contemplated by the Defense Department. Here is what the Department of Defense said about its 3+3 program in the Secretary's 1998 report to Congress: `a deployed NMD system either could be compliant with the ABM Treaty as written, or might require amendment of the treaty's provisions.' So according to the Secretary of Defense, the system DoD is developing now may not comply with the ABM treaty. And so this arms control argument is nothing but a strawman, erected to be knocked down though it bears no resemblance to anything in this bill. 
Senator Levin cites as an authority for this odd proposition, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who, in a letter commenting on S. 1873, said the bill doesn't consider `the impact a deployment would have on arms control agreements and nuclear arms reductions.' Let's think about what General Shelton is saying here. The United States has a right to deploy a national missile defense system under the ABM Treaty, and S. 1873 merely calls for a commitment to exercise that right. But General Shelton is saying that our decision to exercise that right should be conditioned on the possible impact a deployment would have on future arms control agreements, meaning, presumably, Russian objections. So General Shelton is saying that our right to deploy a system to protect our citizens--even the severely constrained right embodied in the ABM treaty--should be subject to further negotiation with, and the approval of, the Russian Federation. 
I would find this an extraordinary argument under any circumstances, and extraordinarily disturbing coming from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It can't be comforting to the people of the United States to know that their Chairman believes their defense should be subject to the veto of the Russians. When one considers that the Russians have exercised their right to defend themselves with the only operational ABM system in the world, the position of the Chairman becomes downright bizarre. 
The complaints about arms control from opponents of the Cochran-Inouye bill are without merit. They spring from this administration's infatuation with paper agreements, no matter how disconnected from reality those agreements may be. We have a paper arms control agreement called START I, which the Russians are routinely violating. We have START II, which was negotiated, then renegotiated to give the Russians a better deal, and still it lies before the Duma unratified. Yet opponents of this bill would have the United States forego the defense of its people against a threat wholly unrelated to any of these agreements, simply because they fear the Russians will insist upon it. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act. This is a simple bill which merely states that due to the increasing ballistic missile threat we face, `It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).' Outside of the title and findings of the legislation, this is the only sentence in the bill. 
As a matter of fact, S. 1873 is noteworthy for the things it does not say. The bill does not say what kind of system architecture the missile defense system should have. It does not say where such a system should be located, or more generally, whether it should be based on land, at sea, or in space. It does not specify a date by which such a system should be deployed, or when we believe specific missile threats to the United States will materialize. 
And the bill is silent on arms control issues. It does not address whether continued adherence to the ABM Treaty is in the best interests of the United States or whether the treaty should be modified. Nor does the bill discuss the merits of any future arms control agreements. All of these issues will have to be debated another day. I am disappointed, however, that we are still debating whether the United States should deploy a national missile defense system at some point in the future.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when Congress passed the Personal Responsibility and Work Responsibility Reconciliation Act of 1996, it ended public welfare for most aliens who had not worked to earn their benefits. 
The 1997 Balanced Budget Act reversed some of the provisions of that bill by reinstating eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program for disabled and elderly immigrants who were in the country before August 22, 1996, the day the omnibus welfare reform package passed into law. But the act also reinstated SSI for immigrants who were in the country as of August 22, 1996 and become disabled in the future. The SSI program is fraught with fraud. According to the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Social Security Administration sends out $27 billion in SSI checks annually. Approximately $4 billion in checks are sent out erroneously. Immigrants, who make up just 6 percent of the population, currently receive over half the cash benefits from the SSI program. 
The agriculture research bill we are debating today restores food stamp eligibility for the elderly and the disabled, and for children, as long as they were in the United States before August 22, 1996. But, the agriculture research bill also includes the restoration of food stamp benefits for all immigrants who were in the country as of August 22, 1996, but who become disabled in the future. The Congress is going to spend approximately $800 million to restore all of these benefits. The food stamp program, like the SSI program, does not require that an individual have contributed to the Social Security base. And, the food stamp program is also susceptible to fraud and abuse--in a just released GAO report, it is estimated that recipients were overpaid an estimated $1.5 billion, or 7 percent of the approximately $22 billion food stamps program. And, that is only the fraud that is quantifiable by the government. The GAO believes there are other forms of fraud in the food stamp program that are too difficult to quantify. 
As a result of the 1997 Budget and this bill, those individuals who were in the country and disabled on August 22, 1996 will continue to be eligible for SSI and for food stamps. But, the Congress has to draw the line somewhere. The sponsors of currently healthy immigrants who entered the country before August 22, 1996 should be responsible for those immigrants' care should they fall on hard times. That has always been the law. In fact, since the early part of the century any immigrant who becomes a public charge can actually be removed from the United States. 
For those individuals who do become disabled and for whom there is no sponsor support, the Immigration and Naturalization Service already has the authority to waive the normal requirements of becoming a citizen. By becoming a citizen, such individuals would automatically be eligible for SSI and for food stamps should they qualify. 
Mr. President, now is not the time to reverse our course on welfare reform, as such reform applies both to our U.S. citizens and to our immigrants. America is a land of immigrants, yes. But, we must not perpetuate dependence on public benefits. Our nation must be one of opportunity for our immigrants, not one that skirts the law by providing a loophole for some immigrants to become dependent on public assistance in the future. The Senate should remove the provisions of the conference report that continue food stamp benefits for immigrants in the future.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. This is a much stronger and much more effective bill because of the time that the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, has taken to thoroughly investigate problems at the agency and identify meaningful solutions. I want to commend him for his work. 
The politically easy thing to do would have been to rush the original bill to a vote, as many on the other side tried to do on numerous occasions. But by taking the time to do the job right, we have a much better bill. For one thing, we now have far stronger provisions to protect innocent spouses. The legislation would ensure that innocent spouses are responsible only for their own tax liability. 
Madam President, it was two and a half months ago that I came before the Senate to discuss the plight of a constituent of mine, a woman who divorced in late 1995. She paid her taxes in full and on time during the last two years of her marriage, but her husband apparently did not. The IRS ultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse did not pay. It did not aggressively pursue the tax bill with him. 
After two weeks after hearing from my constituent, I sent Chairman Roth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform bill, and on that short list was a recommendation to make innocent-spouse relief easier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, or at least to all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill. 
So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused on the issue of innocent-spouse protection and has included provisions that better protect my constituent and women across the country in similar situations. 
The Finance Committee has improved upon the bill in other ways, too. For example, it would suspend interest charges and penalties after one year if the IRS fails to notify a taxpayer of a deficiency. Without that provision, taxpayers can find that penalties and interest started accruing years before they were ever made aware that there was a problem with their tax returns. 
The bill would make the Taxpayer Advocate's office independent of the agency to ensure that it represents the taxpayers' interest, not just the agency's interest. It would give the IRS Commissioner the statutory authority he needs to restructure the agency. It would hold IRS employees accountable for their actions by requiring the agency to terminate employees who commit perjury, falsify documents, or violate the rules to retaliate against a taxpayer. It would make the offers-in-compromise program more fair to taxpayers. And it would ensure due process in collections activities. 
These are important things--changes worth taking the time to make. We have got to try to get things right. Too many past attempts to rein in the IRS have come up short, and once Congress's attention turns to other things, the agency has gone back to business as usual. 
This is a good bill. It deserves an `aye' vote. But let us be under no illusion that even a good reform bill will solve the myriad problems that exist. Our nation's Tax Code, as currently written, amounts to thousands of pages of confusing, seemingly contradictory tax-law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless that reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the Internal Revenue Code, problems with collections and enforcement are likely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it does not matter what kind of personnel or process changes we make at the agency. Complexity invites different interpretations of the tax laws from different people, and that is where most of the problems at the IRS arise. 
Replacing the existing code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would facilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive IRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to lobby for complicated tax loopholes. 
There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are pending before Congress: a flat-rate income tax; a national sales tax, the Kemp Commission's simpler single-rate tax. Each has its passionate advocates in Congress and around the country, and any one of these options would be preferable to the existing income-tax system. 
So why, many people will ask, have we not been able to settle on one of them and act on fundamental tax reform? The answer is that, while there is overwhelming public consensus in favor of an overhaul of the Tax Code, a public consensus has yet to emerge in favor of a sales tax over a flat tax or some alternative. And given President Clinton's lack of support for fundamental tax reform, it is likely to take a public consensus, the likes of which we have not seen in recent years, to drive such a tax-overhaul plan through Congress, past the President, and into law. 
Steve Forbes made tax reform the central theme of his campaign for the presidency two years ago. He carried Arizona in the Republican presidential primary, in large part because his tax plan resonated among the people in my state. Yet he failed to win the nomination, and neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole pursued the issue with as much passion or conviction. And it will take a national campaign to build the kind of consensus that will be needed to move forward with fundamental tax reform, which is probably the most momentous undertaking of the century. 
The IRS reform bill, Finance Committee hearings about taxpayer abuse by the IRS, the Kemp Commission's recommendations in favor of fundamental tax reform, new proposals to sunset the IRS Code, and the debate that sponsors of the flat tax and sales tax have taken on the road in recent months, will all help to move the discussion forward. 
In conclusion, we can pass an IRS reform bill to try to rein in the IRS and make sure that it treats taxpayers fairly, reasonably, and respectfully. But let us not fool ourselves. The IRS cannot be faulted for a Tax Code that is too complex and filled with contradictory provisions. 
Until the Tax Code is simplified, problems in one form or another are likely to persist. We must use this opportunity to begin the debate about fundamental tax reform.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to conclude this discussion of the Senate Finance Committee's work in exposing problems with the IRS by 
commending the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for holding the series of hearings to expose problems in the Internal Revenue Service's dealings with taxpayers. I also want to thank the taxpayers and IRS employees who had the courage to come forward and tell their stories publicly. Although we all knew that there were serious problems with the way the IRS does business, it is safe to say that all of us were truly shocked at what we learned from the hearings. 
As Senator Roth put it, we found that the IRS far too often targets vulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility and arrogance, uses unethical and even illegal tactics to collect money that sometimes is not even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate employees. 
Its effort, obviously, is to try to bring in more money. But I think all of us would agree that it is not an acceptable behavior, and, therefore, clearly that kind of behavior will be dealt with in the legislation which we will be preparing. 
I think it is also important to make the point that most IRS employees, like most other Government employees, are not only law abiding and very hard working but are very professional in what they do. They have, especially at the IRS, the very difficult and even thankless task of administering the code that, frankly, the Congress and the President made extremely complex and difficult to administer. It is filled with contradictory provisions. It is often open to differing interpretations. Frankly, we have given the IRS tremendous power in administering the code, but it is power that can bankrupt families, can put people out of their homes, and, as we heard, even ruin some lives. Any abuse of that power is intolerable. 
Let me recount some of the things that have been uncovered as a result of these hearings. We heard that a taxpayer was hounded by the IRS for overpaying his taxes. The IRS put one constituent through the wringer of audits annually for 20 years and never found anything wrong. 
Another person received a tax refund in error from the IRS. Knowing that it was an error, the constituent never cashed the check, yet when the IRS discovered its own error later, it demanded the refund back with interest. 
One family that had a lien placed on its house worked out a payment plan with one IRS agent, only to have another IRS agent institute foreclosure proceedings. What is most galling to taxpayers is not that they have to pay taxes, but that there is virtually no recourse when the IRS makes an error. The cost of setting things right--hiring attorneys and CPAs--can be so high that people agree to pay taxes and penalties that they do not really owe. 
Another thing we found was the abuse that innocent spouses can suffer at the hands of the IRS and current law. By resisting calls from the other side to rush the IRS reform bill to vote, we have been able to craft far stronger provisions to protect innocent spouses. The legislation that will come before the Senate next week would ensure that innocent spouses are responsible only for their own tax liability. 
It was two and a half months ago that I came before the Senate to discuss the plight of a constituent of mine, a woman who divorced in late 1995. She paid her taxes in full and on time during the last two years of her marriage, but her husband apparently did not. The IRS ultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse did not pay. It did not aggressively pursue the tax bill with him. 
About two weeks after hearing from my constituent, I sent Chairman Roth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform bill, and on that short list was a recommendation to make innocent-spouse relief easier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, or at least to all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill. 
So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused on the issue of innocent-spouse protection and has included provisions that better protect my constituent and women across the country in similar situations.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to take this personal privilege of explaining why I was not able to vote last night on an extraordinarily important issue before the Senate; namely, the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. 
The vote, fortunately, was 80 to 19, meaning that the United States has gone on record as supporting the inclusion of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland as members of this important alliance. 
When the debate started, I provided remarks which expressed my strong sentiments in support of that expansion. Throughout the debate, as amendments were offered, I spoke to several of them, attempting to defeat amendments that I thought would be detrimental to the expansion of NATO and to our mission in NATO. 
Fortunately, one of the first amendments adopted was an amendment which I offered, which helped us to present a strategic vision in the discussions that would be ongoing with respect to the development of a new strategic vision for NATO that reflects the beliefs of the U.S. Senate and reflects our belief that the original purposes of NATO and the original strategic vision should play a large role in animating our assistance, with our fellow NATO members, in devising a new strategic mission. 
I say all of that as a predicate to state in the most emphatic terms that had I been able to be here, I would have voted `aye' to support the expansion of NATO. Ironically, my absence last night was due to the fact that I was supposed to be on my way to a conference in Europe, which is the New Atlantic Initiative Conference to discuss and support NATO and NATO expansion. The New Atlantic Initiative is a relatively new organization, founded among, other things, to promote the continued development of, and enhancement of, the strong relationship between the United States and our NATO allies. 
Unfortunately, because a lot of my colleagues had a lot to say and had amendments to offer, many of which were ultimately withdrawn, the leader and the distinguished minority leader were not able to close the debate in time for me to make that vote. Unfortunately, also, I delayed my departure until the very last aircraft to Europe. That aircraft was taken out of service. That is why, about midnight last night, I learned not only that I would not be able to go to that NATO conference but that I had also missed the vote on NATO expansion. I regret that very much, because I would have liked to have been here to cast my vote in support of that. 
I note that a letter from the distinguished majority leader, which I was to deliver to the representatives of the Turkish Government, has been delivered, and, therefore, the Senate is also represented at that conference as it is going on here today. I certainly appreciate the majority leader's support for that.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It calls on the administration to initiate arms control negotiations with Russia on tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The amendment seeks to push the United States down what I think is an extremely ill-advised path. 
First of all, tactical nuclear weapons are essential to NATO. A credible alliance nuclear policy requires widespread participation in nuclear roles by our European allies. 
The dual-capable aircraft and the few hundred substrategic nuclear gravity bombs which are deployed in Europe provide an essential political and military link between the European and the North Atlantic members of the alliance. The devices deployed on European soil are essential to an equitable sharing of the risk and burden associated with NATO's nuclear mission. 
Second, the presence of U.S. tactical nuclear systems in Europe is an important demonstration of the U.S. commitment to deterring all threats to the territory of the alliance. These weapons are a visible sign that NATO is prepared to use any and all force necessary to deter an attack. For this reason, the defense ministers of the alliance have on multiple occasions expressed their support for the continued stationing of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. 
I ask my colleagues to ponder for a moment the message that this amendment would send if the United States were to expand NATO while simultaneously abandoning our nuclear commitments. Such a step would mean the hollowing out of the United States article V commitments and would gut the world's most powerful, stable defensive military alliance. NATO is different and vastly superior to other multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, because the members of the alliance do not merely pay lip service to the principles of collective defense. 
Third, the fact that we have tactical nuclear weapons in Europe has nothing to do with the existence of or the number of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. We maintain them in Europe for reasons that I just mentioned. Throwing our tactical nuclear weapons into an arms control agreement with Russian tactical weapons makes no sense. 
Finally, in the past, the United States has refused to agree to negotiate these weapons, for good reason. Simply put, it would be impossible to verify that the Russians are, in fact, complying with any agreement. Instead, the United States prudently focused on limiting delivery systems, such as missiles and bombs, which are large and observable and, therefore, verifiable. Given the importance of these weapons to the United 
States and the NATO alliance, and given the fact we would not be able to match the Russians cheating, as they have done on every arms control treaty we have ever signed with them, this amendment is conceptually flawed. 
Again, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think that the flaw in the argument just stated is obvious. It is true, as Senator Conrad points out, that there are no words in his amendment that talk about taking American tactical weapons out of Europe. That is not the point I was making. It is also true he could have said that there are no words in here that specifically call for the United States to reduce the number of American missiles. 
He then makes the point that it would be desirable, since the Russians have more tactical nuclear weapons than we do, to get them to reduce those numbers. Indeed, it would. But I ask you, Mr. President, how we are going to initiate discussions--which is what this amendment precisely calls for as a condition to moving forward here--without putting at risk some of the American tactical nuclear weapons. I discussed all of the reasons why we need those tactical nuclear weapons. The very point that Senator Conrad makes, that the Russians have a lot more than we do, makes the point that we can't afford to reduce the number that we have. 
So, as a practical matter, while the words about reducing our tactical weapons are not in the amendment, there is no way to get the Russians to reduce their numbers unless we reduce our numbers as well. That is why, as I said, Mr. President, this amendment, which would have the effect, if these negotiations are in any way successful from Senator Conrad's point of view, of reducing American tactical nuclear weapons. That is why this amendment should be rejected.

Mr. KYL. First of all, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Delaware and certainly support the points he made. 
I think it is critical to go directly to the heart of what is behind this amendment. It has been a longstanding objective of the Russians to break our tactical nuclear connection with our NATO allies; make no mistake about that. We should do nothing in the U.S. Senate that assists the Russians in achieving this long-term goal. 
Secondly, we need tactical nuclear weapons in the so-called credibility ladder. I would be very concerned if the only weapons we had at our disposal to act as a deterrent were strategic nuclear weapons. Mr. President, sometimes you need a graduated response. And to suggest that we should reduce the number of our weapons and we can do that by cutting out half if the Russians cut out half, that would leave us very few weapons, not enough to pose a credible deterrence. To suggest that we do that and then rely upon strategic weapons I think is something that no one in this Chamber would want to support. 
And finally, as our colleague from Delaware said, we should not be tying up NATO expansion with this particular amendment. So I urge my colleagues again to vote against the Conrad amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be delighted to answer the question of my distinguished colleague from Virginia. I will begin, first of all, by setting forth the essential concept or idea underlying this amendment. 
The future course of the NATO alliance, its core purposes and its strategic orientation in this post-cold war era, will be decided by allied negotiations upcoming on the so-called revised strategic concept of NATO. The new document is going to be agreed upon in a little bit less than a year--next April. Senate advice and consent to the NATO enlargement issue here presents a unique opportunity for the Senate of the United States to speak on this issue, an opportunity we would not otherwise have. We, therefore, can help to lay out the strategic vision of NATO from the standpoint of the United States and thus influence the outcome of these negotiations. 
In my view, the current resolution focuses too much on what NATO should not be and should not do. The resolution does not attempt to lay out a comprehensive set of principles to guide development of the strategic concept. And so this proposed amendment will establish the Senate's vision of the future of NATO and, I hope, help to lay the foundation for American positions on the strategic concept. 
Here is the background that will lead up to the answer to the Senator's question. I hope it is the only expression of concern about the amendment because I would certainly like to have his support for what I think is an amendment that will be overwhelmingly supported by both proponents and opponents of expansion. Our principal objective here, I say to the Senator from Virginia, is to ensure that NATO remains an arm of U.S. power and influence. NATO, not the WEU or the OSCE, must remain the principal foundation for the security interests of its members. This means NATO must be prepared militarily to defend against a range of common threats to our vital interests. We have tried to identify what they all are. 
Now, some of us may not like what some of them are and may not like the fact that we will have to respond to them. For example, a radical Islamic terrorism threat in the North Atlantic region may require that we defend against that. That didn't used to be a big problem for NATO. What I have done is insert the words `in the Atlantic area'--words that were not in the underlying resolution of ratification that came out of the committee. So what I have tried to do is both to, yes, acknowledge a threat that we all acknowledge that could arise, but to limit the nature of our response to that in the Atlantic area by the specific language of the section that the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Texas are concerned about. 
This amendment underscores that collective defense will remain the core alliance mission. But it acknowledges that new threats have emerged in the post-cold war era that will require NATO to adapt its military forces and defense planning mechanism.

Mr. KYL. That is an excellent question, Mr. President, and it is, of course, the latter--something that I think the Senator from Virginia and I support. I point to the specific language to confirm my point. In paragraph 5, `common threats,' it says: `NATO members will face common threats to their security in the post-cold war environment, including. . .' Then we list threats. We hope they will never arise. That is the context in which this particular provision is listed. 
If I could just close my comment here, Mr. President, because the Senator from Delaware wishes to comment. This amendment merely conditions Senate advice and consent to its understanding of U.S. policy as it relates to the revising strategic concept of NATO. It acknowledges the principles that have animated our participation in NATO from the very beginning and also identifies the threats that we may face. It states that the Senate understands that the core concepts contained in the 1991 document remain valid today. 
I say to my friend from Virginia, in essence, that the 1991 strategic concept provides a foundation on which to build the revised statement of NATO strategy and sets forth the 10 principles which the Senator understands will be in the new document. 
I urge my colleagues who support and oppose the expansion of NATO to support this amendment and to put the Senate on record as defining the NATO of the future. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I make that statement in order to assure my colleagues who are concerned about enlarged missions that it is not our intention to try to expand the mission of NATO. But what we are concerned about is helping the administration of the United States define very clearly to our European allies our strategic vision of NATO as a defense alliance. Unfortunately, some Europeans have a different point of view. They would limit NATO solely to the mission of collective defense against an armed attack, elevate the WEU to the principal military organization for responding to all other threats to NATO security, and cuts the United States out of decisionmaking on issues affecting our vital interests. Some undermine our ability to shape NATO as a viable 21st century military alliance, and that is why I offered this amendment, to help make clear an unambiguous U.S. policy on the future direction of the alliance using the fundamental principles which have existed since 1949 when these concepts were first enunciated and which in the Foreign Relations Committee report at that time said that, of course, each party would have to decide in the light of circumstances surrounding the case and the nature and extent of the assistance whether, in fact, an armed attack had occurred and article 5 thus brought into play--armed attack relating to different kinds of situations that might not be a direct invasion but might, from other kinds of causes nevertheless, pose a security risk to the states within NATO. 
So I really believe we have not expanded the current policy, but I hope we have clarified for our friends in Europe the limits of the U.S. policy, the vision, the strategic vision that we have. I appreciate the questions raised by the Senators from New York and Virginia to help us clarify that point.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for allowing me about 20 seconds. May I also say to the Senator from Minnesota, who has just spoken, and the Senator from Indiana that I subscribe to their remarks and appreciate the strength of their statements. 
Mr. President, the United States Senate today has the rare opportunity to right a historical wrong. In the years immediately following World War II, Europe was forcibly divided. As the United States helped to rebuild the nations of Western Europe, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe were subjugated under the heavy hand of Soviet domination. To counter this Soviet expansion into Europe, the United States and its Western European allies forged the most effective defense alliance in modern history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The military and political strength of this alliance made it the guarantor of an unprecedented period of peace in Western Europe and contributed significantly to the eventual demise of the Soviet Union. 
Today, the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are free, and three of them--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--are seeking to take advantage of an opportunity denied them following World War II, the opportunity to join NATO, an alliance described by Harvard Professor Samuel Huntington as `the security organization of Western civilization [whose] primary purpose [in the post-Cold War world] is to defend and preserve that civilization.' It is my hope that the United States Senate will grant them this opportunity--an opportunity that these nations deserve and have earned. 
In the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, these three nations have demonstrated a commitment to the Western ideals embodied by the NATO alliance. Their dogged pursuit of democratic institutions, free market economies, and human freedom will serve to remind the existing members of NATO what it means to be a part of the Western world. Indeed, their dedication to these ideals is all the more zealous because they know first hand what it is like to suffer under a regime that denies its citizens basic human freedom. 
The enlargement of the NATO alliance to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic serves America's national interests. The essence of the U.S. national interest in the world is promoting the security, well-being, and expansion of the community of nations that respect their citizens' democratic rights. Although this is a moral policy, it is not an entirely altruistic one. The freedom, prosperity, and security of Americans--our standard of living and our domestic civil liberties--all are enhanced and bolstered when this community of free nations grows bigger and stronger, especially when it does so in Europe, where our closest allies and our most profound interests are concentrated. 
The enlargement of NATO will also send a clear message to any power who may wish to interfere with the ongoing process of democratization in Europe: you will not succeed, so do not even try. 
I know that the enlargement of NATO will not be free. Clearly, additional financial resources will be required on the part of all NATO members--old and new alike. These new costs must be shared equitably by all allies. Although enlargement will ultimately require an increased financial commitment by the United States, I believe that the substantial dividends that will accrue to the U.S. from enlargement justify our strong support for this endeavor. 
I urge my colleagues to support the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO, so that, as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently noted, `three nations who have long been our allies in spirit will become our allies in fact.' It is the right thing to do, and it serves our national interest.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words this afternoon about the U.N. global climate treaty that the Clinton administration agreed to in Kyoto, Japan, this past December, and which you, as the Presiding Officer, have taken a real lead in helping your colleagues here in the Senate to understand. In fact, I know that you helped to lead a delegation to those proceedings in Kyoto. 
This treaty will require the United States to drastically reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions, presumably by rationing our energy consumption and assessing taxes on energy use and production. 
The reduction of pollutants, of course, is a laudable goal. I wholeheartedly support efforts that will produce a cleaner environment. But what the administration fails to adequately appreciate is that protecting the environment is a global issue, one all nations must actively take part in if global environmental protection is truly to be attained. The administration would like the American people to believe that this debate is about who is for or against the environment; but, that is not the case. This debate is about whether or not this particular treaty is in the best interests of the American people and the global environment. 
The underlying hypothesis used by proponents of the treaty is that greenhouse gases, which trap the sun's infrared rays and heat the earth's atmosphere, have become so abundant in the atmosphere that a `global warming' effect has commenced, and that the cause of this phenomenon is manmade. On the basis of this as-yet unproven connection between human activity and the climate, delegates at the climate change conference in Kyoto reached an agreement to curb greenhouse-gas emissions. The treaty, if ratified, would legally bind the U.S. to cut its overall emissions of six gases by seven percent below 1990 levels by 2012. However, 130 developing countries, such as Mexico, China, Korea, and India, would not be held liable to these same standards. 
The evidence of global warming is inconclusive, at best. For the past 20 years, precisely the same 20 years during which carbon dioxide levels have increased the most, the earth has actually cooled. This cooling flies in the face of the theory that man-made emissions are causing a global warming effect. Models cannot accurately predict what the weather will be like next week, let alone what temperatures will prevail on Earth in the next century. The only consensus that has been reached within the scientific community--that future effects of fossil-fuel use are most likely to be gradual over many decades to come--gives good reason for the U.S. government not to rush to judgement. 
Committing the U.S. to these targets will have severe economic effects on American families and workers. According to the Heritage Foundation, holding emissions to 1990 levels will raise energy prices between 50 and 200 percent; average households would pay $1,620 in additional taxes a year; and the economy would contract by a total of $3.3 trillion, all by the year 2020. I note that these figures are based on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels only; going seven percent below these levels, as agreed to by the Clinton administration, will result in more serious hardships for the American people. Furthermore, the AFL-CIO estimates that reducing emissions to 1990 levels will result in the loss of 1.25 to 1.5 million American jobs. And these jobs will not simply disappear; rather, industry will move overseas and reestablish itself in those countries that are not legally bound to gas-emissions targets. These combined effects would place the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage, while failing to address the global problem of soaring amounts of pollution produced by the developing nations of the world. 
Meanwhile, the developing countries are projected to continue accelerating their use of fossil fuels during the next century. By 2015, China will surpass the U.S. in total carbon emissions. Without the full participation of the developing countries in any treaty of this kind, unilateral attempts by the developed nations to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions will not significantly slow the steady increase of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. 
In sum, the United States should not be party to a global climate treaty that is not supported by a scientific consensus, that puts an unfair burden on American workers and consumers, and that asks us to turn back the clock on economic growth and our standard of living. More importantly, this treaty fails to effectively address the issue because it ignores the developing countries of the world. It simply does not make sense, either environmentally or economically, to focus on the nations that are already spending billions on pollution control and making substantial progress, while ignoring developing nations--countries where emissions could be curbed by employing the same basic technologies the United States has used so successfully to reduce its levels of pollution. U.S. companies, using the best available technology, are able to eliminate the bulk of pollution from their emissions. To achieve an additional increment of pollution reduction, developed nations like the U.S. would be required to expend inordinate sums of money in pursuit of only marginal improvements. The costs associated with attempting to squeeze out the last increments of pollution will heavily outweigh any benefits in the developed nations. However, in countries where pollution-control technology is not as advanced or widespread as it is here, a dollar spent on equipment will provide far greater reductions in overall pollution. Thus, the cost/benefit ratio favors pressing developing nations to catch up with us. The Global Climate Treaty does not do this. 
Faced with certain defeat on this issue, the administration has resorted to a level of fear mongering which I think has been unmatched since the 1970s, when some of the same scientists who are promoting global warming warned at that time that we were about to enter upon the next ice age. I find it hard to believe that in a mere 20 years, our climate has moved from one extreme to the other. In a December Wall Street Journal article, Arthur Robinson and Zachary Robinson of the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine point out that `there is not a shred of persuasive evidence that humans are responsible for increasing global temperatures.' But the administration, in an effort to rally support, issues apocalyptic warnings that, if global warming is not headed off, we will experience floods, droughts, rising sea levels, and the spread of infectious diseases. The global warming hypothesis should not be taken as fact; Americans should not be scared into accepting unsubstantiated scenarios as the truth. 
The Senate fulfilled the first half of its `advise and consent' role this summer by passing the Byrd-Hagel resolution 95 to 0. That bipartisan advice instructed the administration not to sign a treaty that did not include the developing countries of the world in the same emission-control requirements, or a treaty that would cause great economic harm to America. The treaty to which the administration has agreed meets neither of these guidelines. Therefore, because the administration was unwilling to consider the Senate's advice, I do not believe the Senate will give its consent--nor should it.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the A+ accounts bill, and I want to commend its chief Senate sponsor, Senator Paul Coverdell, for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor. 
Mr. President, this legislation does several things. It would allow more people to save for education in tax-preferred education savings accounts. The savings could be used for higher education, as well as education at the elementary and secondary levels. The bill would extend the existing tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance through the year 2002, and it would make savings in qualified state tuition plans tax-free. It would also create a new category of tax-exempt facility bonds to assist with school construction in high-growth areas. 
Mr. President, perhaps the most important part of the bill is also the most controversial: the provisions that expand the allowable uses of education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary education. These provisions would put additional resources under the control of the people who know and understand the needs of children best--their families. 
Here is how it works. Families earning less than $95,000--$150,000 on a joint tax return--could put up to $2,000 in after-tax dollars into special interest-bearing accounts for each child. The funds would accumulate tax free, and could be withdrawn for any educational expense--from books and transportation to special programs and private-school tuition. 
A family saving just $10 per week could accumulate about $4,000 by the time a newborn enters the first grade. Over the course of the child's education, the money could be spent on a school uniform, special tutoring, a home computer, tuition at a private or parohial school, an SAT preparation course, or any other educational expense. This is one of the rare occasions in Washington when we are talking about empowering parents--rather than government bureaucrats--to decide how best to satisfy their children's educational needs. An estimated 14 million families are expected to take advantage of these new tax-preferred savings accounts. 
Defenders of the status quo will throw up a series of arguments about why parents should not be trusted with more control over their children's education. Some will suggest that this will divert resources from public schools into private schools. Let me make two points about that. 
First, I think it is important to recall that we are not talking about a new subsidy for private or parochial schools. To the contrary, we are talking about allowing families to keep more of what they earn--after all, it is their money--to send their children to the elementary or secondary school of their choice. 
We already go far beyond what would be allowed by this bill when we provide federal financial assistance to students at the college level, including students who attend private or religious institutions. No one argues that such choice harms public colleges or universities. In fact, it is choice and competition that has made our Nation's colleges and universities the best in the world. So I am perplexed why anyone would fear giving parents more choice and control at the elementary and secondary levels, as well. That is where the real crisis in education exists today, and it is where choice and competition will do the most good. 
Second, providing families with tax incentives for education savings will not decrease federal or state funding for public schools by a single dime. The fact is, Congress is likely to approve increases in funding for education in addition to the incentives that would come with the Coverdell bill. The budget resolution that we approved two weeks ago does exactly that, adhering to the spending levels set out in the budget agreement negotiated between Congress and the President just last year. 
Here is what President Clinton said about the education-spending levels in that agreement last July. These are his words: 
* * * at the heart of this balanced budget [agreement] is the historic investment in education--the most significant increase in education funding in more than 30 years. 
The most significant increase in education spending in a generation--that is the level of funding that is provided under the budget we just passed, and it is in addition to the assistance provided under the Coverdell bill. 
Another point: The people who stand to gain the most from this legislation are those of more modest means who might not have the same choice or opportunity without the help that the Coverdell bill would provide. Of the people currently opting for Catholic schools, for example, 68 percent have annual incomes of $35,000 or less. Wealthier people obviously have the means to send their children to the school of their choice whether they receive a tax break or not. And in any event, wealthier taxpayers will not even qualify for the relief in this bill, give the income thresholds that are set out in it. 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that all of the agruments against the bill are based upon the flawed premise that public schools cannot compete successfully with other institutions. They are wrong. Many public schools have very well-regarded programs--programs that meet or exceed what is offered to students elsewhere--and it is likely that these schools would not only retain their current student body, but add to it with barriers to choice removed. And with additional enrollment would come additional funds for their budgets. 
It is true that failing schools would be forced to improve or face declining enrollment. But is it really our goal to force students with few financial resources to remain in a failing environment? Should they not have the same options that others have to find a school that better meets their needs? 
In Senate hearings earlier this year, low-income parents questioned why the schoolhouse door is often closed to their children--why they are kept from moving their children to schools that can better meet their children's needs. Why, these parents wanted to know, are their kids denied the chance to attend safer schools? They are right to ask questions. They deserve--their children deserve--access to a quality education. 
In my opinion, the single best thing we could do to improve the quality of education in this country is give parents more choice and control over where they send their children. It is an idea with broad support among the American people. A 1997 poll conducted by the Center for Education Reform found support for school choice among the general public at 82 percent. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies reported support among African Americans at more than 70 percent. It is an idea whose time has come. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in support of the A+ bill.

Mr. KYL. I note, Mr. President, that this amendment was supposed to have been discussed earlier. That undoubtedly accounts for the confusion, because it should have occurred already. However, I was not here at the time and, therefore, it will be the last amendment discussed prior to the time the votes start, for the benefit of my colleagues. 
This is a very straightforward amendment. It expresses the sense of the Senate in favor of a supermajority vote for raising taxes. 
Mr. President, the tax burden imposed on the American people has grown so large that it is beginning to act as a drag on the Nation's economy. As a share of the gross domestic product, revenues to the Treasury will rise from 19.9 percent this year to 20.1 percent next year. That would be higher than any year since 1945, and it would be only the third year in our entire history during which revenues have exceeded 20 percent of the national income. Notably, the first two times that revenues broke the 20 percent mark, the economy tipped into recession. 
Mr. President, we are talking about something very serious, and that is the possibility that this great economic engine that has been creating budget surpluses for the Federal Government and a great standard of living for the American people could come to a screeching halt if we do not begin to do something about the tax burden imposed upon the American people. 
Many of us believe it would have been prudent to consider more tax relief in the budget this year. But it seems to me that if the Congress and the President cannot agree on more tax relief, we at least ought to be able to agree that taxes should go no higher. The House of Representatives, I inform my colleagues, is scheduled to vote in April on an initiative to make it much harder for Congress to raise taxes. It would require a two-thirds majority vote in each House in order to add to the tax burden. 
The sense-of-the-Senate amendment that I have offered now will begin the debate in the Senate as well. I do not specify a particular percentage that would constitute a supermajority for purposes of raising taxes, but simply request that we go on record as expressing support for the principle that a supermajority should be required. I will briefly explain why. 
A third of the Nation's population imposes tax limitations on their State governments. Voters have approved tax limits by wide margins, so this is not something new or risky. In my home 
state of Arizona, for example, a tax limitation passed with 72 percent of the vote, and we are one of the fastest growing States in the Nation. We have one of the lowest tax burdens, one of the highest rates of growth. In Florida, another high-growth State, a tax limitation amendment was adopted with 69.2 percent of the vote; in Nevada, with 70 percent. I daresay, Mr. President, these are probably three of the fastest growing States in the country. 
A tax limitation ensures growth, reduces taxes, provides more jobs and, I believe, would be a good thing for the Federal Government to adopt for the entire country with respect to Federal taxes. 
The proposed Constitutional amendment, which is referred to in the pending sense of the Senate amendment, now has 23 cosponsors in the Senate. It is something that was recommended by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform. In fact, that commission, which you will recall was chaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, advocated the supermajority requirement in its report on how to achieve a simpler single-rate tax to replace the existing maze of tax rates, deductions, exemptions and credits that makes the Federal Tax Code so complicated as we know it today. 
Here are the words of the commission:  
The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than seven years. The commission believes that a two-thirds supermajority vote of Congress will earn American's confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of the new tax system. 
Mr. President, there is no small irony in the fact that it would have taken a two-thirds majority vote of the House and Senate to overcome President Clinton's veto and enact the 1995 Balanced Budget Act with its tax relief provisions. Yet, by contrast, the President's record-setting tax increase in 1993 was enacted with only a simple majority and, in fact, not even a majority of elected Senators at that. Vice President Gore broke a tie vote of 50-50 to secure passage of the tax increase in the Senate. 
A tax limitation is based on a simple premise: that it ought to be at least as hard to raise people's taxes as it is to cut them.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, colleagues, this is a very straightforward sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It would simply express the sense of the Senate that we support a supermajority to raise taxes. Many of the States in this country now have supermajorities. In some of the fastest growing States like Arizona and Florida and Nevada, our State legislatures pass supermajorities to raise taxes with 69, 70, 71 percent of the vote. It has not hurt the economy. In fact, it has helped the economy of those States. 
The House of Representatives will be considering a constitutional amendment to do this. The Senate will probably not be considering that. But I do think it is important, before tax day, April 15, for the Senate to at least express its view that it ought to be as hard to raise taxes as it is to cut taxes. That means we should have some kind of a supermajority to raise taxes here in the U.S. Congress. 
It is a sense of the Senate. It expresses a very simple proposition that Americans are taxed enough and that to tax them any more should require more than a bare majority of the House and the Senate.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 493, the Cellular Telephone Protection Act, and urge the President to sign this important piece of legislation without delay. This bill makes it easier for federal law enforcement to stop cell phone cloning by targeting cloning at its source--the equipment (`black boxes') used to alter or modify the ESN (electronic serial number) of a cellular phone. 
I am particularly pleased that this bill has the support of the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Justice, the wireless phone industry, and Congress. 
This bill is not only a victory for law enforcement, but also for the 56 million Americans who currently use wireless/cellular service. According to the cellular telecommunications industry, consumers lose in excess of $650 million a year due to fraud, much of it as a result of cloning. This results in increased costs to cellular customers.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me take about 30 seconds and then see if anyone on the other side wishes to speak to this. This is a very simple sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and I will read you what the sense is. I cannot imagine people would oppose this principle. 
It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice, and not be limited in such right by the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat seniors on a private basis. . . 
Mr. President, there are a lot of details in legislation that might ultimately be passed that we can argue about, but I think there is no doubt that in expressing the principle, we can all be in agreement that just because one turns 65 and is eligible for Medicare does not mean they lose the right to see the physician of their own choice. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and will see if there is anyone who wishes to speak in opposition.

It is true that legislation that would actually change the law would certainly have to consider all kinds of issues dealing with fraud and abuse and similar questions that the distinguished minority leader has raised. We can have that debate at the time such legislation might come before us. 
What is before us today is simply a sense of the Senate, an expression of a principle that it is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice. I hope we can at least agree on that basic principle.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New Mexico, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for the budget resolution that he has brought to the Senate floor. It is not exactly as I would have written it--and my hope is that we will be able to make some improvements during the course of debate over the next few days--but I believe it is generally on the right track and compares favorably to the alternative budget submitted by President Clinton. 
First and foremost, the Senate budget resolution would balance the unified budget and keep it in balance during each of the next five years. We will even run a small surplus. 
By comparison, President Clinton's budget appears to throw fiscal discipline out the window with proposals to spend billions of dollars on new government programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Clinton budget would take us back into deficit as early as the year 2000. 
Second, the Senate budget would adhere to the spending limits that both Congress and the President agreed to just last year. The Clinton plan, by contrast, would bust the spending caps outright--by $12 billion in FY99, and a total of $68 billion over the next four years. I think we ought to keep our word and stick to the spending limits, and we do. 
Third, the Senate budget would reserve the anticipated surplus for Social Security. The President said that is what he wanted, too, but he then submitted a budget that would spend down the unified budget surplus on myriad new government programs. And of course, he is asking us to spend every dime of the Social Security surplus on general operating expenses of the government. 
Fourth, our budget would set aside any proceeds from a tobacco settlement to shore up the Medicare trust fund for our nation's senior citizens. The Clinton budget would spend all of the tobacco money on other programs. 
And fifth, the Senate budget would accommodate another, albeit small, installment of tax relief for hard-working Americans. By comparison, President Clinton's budget would raise taxes yet again. 
Mr. President, let me turn for a moment to the portion of the Senate budget resolution that deals with education, training, and employment programs, since that seems to be what we are hearing about most from the other side. Last year's budget agreement made education, training, and employment a protected category and called for spending--outlays--of $61 billion next year. It called for a total of $318.3 billion over five years. 
Here is what President Clinton said about the level of education spending in the budget agreement when he signed off on it last year. These are comments the President made on the South Lawn of the White House on July 29, 1997:  
. . . at the heart of this balanced budget [agreement] is the historic investment in education--the most significant increase in education funding in more than 30 years. 
He went on to call it `the best education budget in a generation and the best for future generations.' The level of spending the President was referring to then is exactly what is included in the Senate budget resolution that is before us today. It is the exact level. 
What about health research? Over the next five years, spending at the National Institutes of Health would increase substantially under the Senate budget. We are talking about an 11 percent increase in 1999, on top of the seven percent increase provided in 1998. And we would provide these additional funds within the overall spending limits, and regardless of whether a tobacco settlement is passed later this year. 
By contrast, President Clinton would link increased NIH spending to the fate of the tobacco settlement. That means that if there is no settlement, there is no increase for the NIH either. I do not think that is good enough. We should devote more to health research whether or not we are able to achieve a tobacco settlement, and we do that in our budget. 
If there is any revenue derived from the tobacco settlement, we say that it ought to go into the Medicare trust fund. And that is what this budget resolution would do. We all know that Medicare's long-term solvency is still tenuous at best. We ought to shore up the system before tapping new sources of revenue for a multitude of new government programs. 
So these are some of the things I think the Senate does better than the alternatives. But, in my opinion, it still does not do enough to limit the growth of federal spending. It is true that the committee-reported budget is within the spending caps that were set last year, but those caps are still too high. The caps allow total spending to grow from $1.73 trillion next year to $1.95 trillion in 2003. That will amount to a nearly 13 percent increase at the end of the five-year period. 
And it comes on top of the 25 percent increase in spending that has occurred in just the last five years. What does that mean for taxpayers? 
The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America saw its 
combined federal, state, and local tax bill climb to 38.2 percent of income last year--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That is more than the average family spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. Put another way, in too many families, one parent is working to put food on the table, while the other is working almost full time just to pay the bill for the government bureaucracy. 
Here is a different way to measure how heavy the federal tax burden is. Consider that federal revenues this year will claim about 19.9 percent of the nation's income, the Gross Domestic Product. Next year, that portion would climb to 20.1 percent, according to the administration's projections. That would be higher than any year since 1945. It would be only the third year in our nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income--and the first two times, our economy tipped into recession. 
So the question we need to ask is whether a balanced budget is the only goal, even if it means we achieve balance at a level where taxes and spending are too high? Or is the real goal of a balanced budget to limit government's size and give people more choices and more control over their lives? 
For me, there is not great achievement in balancing the budget if it means that hard-working families continue to be overtaxed. There is no great achievement in a balanced budget if the government continues to grow, even as it balances its books. If it is doing that, it is continuing to take choice and freedom away from its citizens. A balanced budget is really the means of right-sizing the government so that it is more respectful of hard-working taxpayers' earnings and their desire to support their own families. 
With that in mind, I believe we have got to do much better in providing tax relief. Currently, this budget calls for tax relief amounting to $30 billion over the next five years. Although that may initially sound like a lot, let me put it into perspective. 
The federal government expects to collect nearly $9.3 trillion--that is, $9.3 trillion--over the next five years. So a tax cut of $30 billion really amounts to just about 0.3 percent. It is too little. We must find a way to do more. And the way to do more within the confines of a balanced budget is to reduce non-priority spending and limit spending growth. 
At the very least, if we cannot provide more tax relief, we should at least be able to agree that taxes are high enough and should go no higher. I intend to offer an amendment to express the sense of the Senate that it should be harder to raise taxes--at least as hard to raise taxes as it is to cut them. 
Recall that President Clinton's record-setting tax increase in 1993 failed to win support from even a simple majority of elected Senators--Vice President Gore's vote in favor broke a 50 to 50 tie. By contrast, it would have taken a supermajority vote to provide tax relief two years later; President Clinton vetoed our tax-relief bill, and it would have required a two-thirds vote--67 votes in the Senate--to overcome the President's resistance and provide tax relief. That is wrong. A supermajority vote to raise taxes would ensure that future tax increases, if they are needed, are approved with broad bipartisan support in Congress and around the country. 
Mr. President, I again want to commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for his work on this measure. It is a good proposal, and I think we have an opportunity during the next few days to make it even better.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are now back on amendment No. 2169. That amendment is a sense of the Congress, and it is very simple. I will read the operative clause: 
It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice and not be limited in such right by the imposition of such unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat seniors on a private basis, and that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume that legislation will be enacted to assure this right. 
It is that simple, Mr. President. Senior citizens should not be discriminated against because when they turn 65 they are eligible to receive Medicare. Unfortunately, the administration has taken the position that eligibility to receive Medicare is exclusive; that is to say, that it's either Medicare or no care, that a senior citizen has no right to be treated outside of Medicare for Medicare-covered services. How could we be in that situation in the United States of America, where the Government provides a good program for senior citizens which, in most cases, is going to be precisely what they want to take advantage of, but it says to them that, if there is some reason why you might want to privately contract and pay the bill yourself, you can't do that. 
Here is the history of it, Mr. President. For over 20 years during the time Medicare has been in force, senior citizens have had the right either to go to the physician of their choice and have him submit a bill to Medicare or, if they choose, to be treated outside of Medicare and not submit the bill. There are some people who have not wanted their records to be part of the official Government archive. 
They may have psychiatric problems, for example, and they didn't want to have their treatment be a part of Medicare and they were willing to pay the bill themselves. That is just one example. 
But recently HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, began taking the view that that was illegal and began sending letters to physicians threatening them with prosecution if they treated patients outside of Medicare. So, as part of the Balanced Budget Act, I offered an amendment which prevailed on an overwhelming vote here last year that citizens did, in fact, have the right to privately contract--a very straightforward proposition. 
During the last-minute negotiations of the Balanced Budget Act, however, the administration representatives convinced whoever was negotiating on our side that the President would veto the entire Balanced Budget Act if the Kyl amendment stayed in, and it was changed, pursuant to the administration's request, to provide that while the right of the senior citizen existed, it could only be exercised by a physician who, in advance, dumped all of his Medicare patients for a period of 2 years. That is obviously an unreasonable requirement. Very few, if any, physicians are going to do that. So, as a practical matter, the right of senior citizens to go to a physician of their choice under Medicare was eliminated. 
We have not yet offered legislation for a vote here which would reverse that. But this is the first opportunity we have had, so we present to the Senate a sense of the Senate, as part of the budget resolution, which says that senior citizens should have this right. Then, when the opportune time comes, we will be offering the legislation which has already been introduced and has 49 cosponsors in the Senate, and 190 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, a bill sponsored by the Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer called the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. That legislation, which, as I say, has 49 cosponsors here and 190 in the House already, will be offered, so we will have the opportunity to actually change the law. But pending that, this presents the principle that seniors ought to have this freedom to contract. 
Our resolution, by the way, is sponsored by Senator Hollings, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, Senator Gramm, Senator Domenici, Senator Stevens, Senator Gorton--the Presiding Officer--and, as I say, 49 Members total. 
Let me give an example of a specific situation which came to my attention. One of my constituents from Prescott, AZ--a relatively small town--has a severe case of diabetes. She went to a physician who said, `I am sorry, I am not taking any Medicare patients, so I cannot take care of you.' He was the only specialist, really, in the small community who could care for her. 
Why is it, by the way, that some physicians are in that position? We know that Medicare reimburses at such a low rate--the average is 70 cents on the dollar of cost--that many physicians simply cannot take all Medicare patients. So they have to draw the line and not take any beyond a certain point. 
In any event, she said, `That's fine, bill me directly, and I will be happy to pay.' He said, `Medicare will prosecute me for fraud if I do that.' And that is what we are trying to fix here. There are a lot of situations where people may wish to go to the doctor of their choice and be treated outside of 
Medicare. 
I know of a situation in which I helped a constituent obtain a compassionate release from FDA so that constituent could take an experimental drug to treat her for cancer. The reason is that her husband was willing to go to any lengths, to do anything, to preserve her life. She ended up dying, but I think her case is illustrative of what every one of us would do in her husband's position. If we had the money, if we had the ability, we would go to any length to do anything to save our loved one's life. That is what is being denied American citizens today. 
Believe it or not, the socialized medicine system in Great Britain allows patients this choice. They can either be treated under their socialized medicine system or they can go to a private physician and pay the bill themselves. But here in the United States of America, once you turn 65, you lose that right. This amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that that should not be the case. The seniors here should have the freedom of choice. That right should not be limited by any unreasonable conditions placed upon providers. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to present these views. I would love to hear from anyone who would like to speak in opposition to this principle that senior citizens should have the right to privately contract. I invite anyone who is in opposition to present those views here, because I would love to debate that, as I said. Constituents all over this country are writing in and calling me saying, this is outrageous; please reestablish this right. 
So I am going to cease my presentation now since we are limited in the amount of time we have. I reserve whatever time we have to respond to anyone who is willing to come defend the proposition that senior citizens should not have the right to privately contract in the United States of America. 
Mr. President, observing no other Members on the floor, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, and perhaps those of the Senator from West Virginia as well. 
First of all, let me clarify something. The Senator from Massachusetts says that this is the `freedom to price gouge' and the `freedom to exploit.' In so saying, the Senator misrepresents significantly the amendment, or the bill that Representative Archer and I have introduced, which has a variety of provisions specifically designed to prevent fraud and abuse. 
The only thing that we have before us here today is the sense-of-the-Congress resolution. I draw the Senator's attention to some of the provisions on page 2 which specifically set forth the requirements that would protect against fraud and abuse. In other words, what we are saying is that this freedom to choose must--and I am quoting now from the amendment that we are debating--must include provisions that `are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including the Medicare antifraud provisions in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.' 
Now, if those are not good enough, then perhaps we ought to be changing the existing law. But we are going to actually have more stringent fraud and abuse provisions than the existing law has. So I really in a sense resent the suggestion that there is nothing in here that prevents fraud and abuse. This legislation has more antifraud and abuse provisions than existing law. 
Second point. The Senator from Massachusetts says that only 4 percent, according to a study, only 4 percent of seniors have difficulty getting their health care under Medicare. Well, by my calculation that is `only' 1,360,000 seniors. That is a lot of seniors. 
The truth of the matter is most seniors will take advantage of Medicare. It is a good deal. We hope that will continue to be the case. But for those few who choose to contract privately, why deny them that right? The GAO study cited by the Senator from Massachusetts says, `If direct contracting continued to be rarely used'--and I say `continued to be' because the right does exist today--`there would be no changes in the benefit payments, no additional difficulties in combating fraud and abuse, and no major new administrative burdens placed on HCFA.' 
So if it is not a problem, then why oppose this amendment? GAO says it would not be a problem. And, in fact, the Senator proves too much by the last point that he made. He said, actually it is the case today that if a patient wants to ask the doctor not to submit a claim, the doctor does not have to do that and therefore we already have this so we do not need the Kyl amendment--to which there are two responses. First of all, if current law already provides this, then why does the Senator object to the mere statement of the principle that the choice should exist? If the Senator is happy with existing law, he can't very well oppose the principle that simply restates existing law. 
I again quote from what we are debating. It is frequently helpful to do that. All the sense-of-the-Senate provides is, and I quote, `It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice, and not be limited in such right by the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat seniors on a private basis. . .' 
Does the Senator oppose that principle? The Senator suggests that that is already existing law. If so, then what is the problem? The truth, however, Mr. President, is that it is not existing law. As a matter of fact, the Senator from Massachusetts cannot cite either a statute or a regulation which says that this is existing law, because it is not. HCFA will quietly tell you that they would not mind if a patient did that, but they do not want to advertise it and there is no legal authority for it. 
The truth of the matter is that, as the GAO pointed out, it has always been the case up until January 1, 1998, that patients had this right to privately contract. You have all of the great concerns about fraud and abuse that have been articulated by the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Massachusetts, but I have never heard of one single case--and I would be delighted if the Senator could cite one--where in the past 20 years, since this right did exist until January 1 of this year, there was fraud and abuse as a result of this. I know of none. 
So, Mr. President, I will make one final point. The Senator from West Virginia is not on the floor, but he made the point that this isn't good for Medicare beneficiaries. I suggest, that goes to the heart of this debate. Who decides what is good for the beneficiaries? Washington, DC, bureaucrats or the beneficiaries? Let the beneficiaries decide. 
As the GAO points out, if most beneficiaries do not take advantage of this freedom to contract--and I doubt that they will--then there is no problem. But let them make the decision. We should not be making the decision that they do not have the right even if they desire to exercise it. 
I think it is pretty hard to argue with the proposition that patients should have this freedom of choice. And I have not heard anything yet that persuades me that this is not a good amendment. 
I again urge my colleagues to support it. I thank the Chair.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. 
I think it is probably time for me to respond to some of the things that have been said. I appreciate the spirit in which the comments were made by the Senator from Minnesota, and earlier by the Senator from Arkansas, and certainly also by the Senator from Nevada. We have reasonable differences of opinion about certain matters here. I appreciate the spirit in which their comments have been made. 
But my, oh, my, Mr. President, it is amazing to me that we would have 49 or 50 cosponsors of this legislation in the Senate and almost 200 in the House if it were going to do all of the horrible things that have been suggested by my colleagues. I don't think I could go home. I daresay that I probably represent more senior citizens--or at least as many as my distinguished colleague from Minnesota. In fact, half of the State of Minnesota comes to my State in the wintertime, and we really enjoy visiting with his constituents. Obviously, they probably receive some medical care in our State, too. Obviously, we are not going to be doing something by which my mother 
and father and all of their friends and all of my other senior constituents are going to feel threatened. 
What could it be that is so horrible about this? 
The Senators from Arkansas and Nevada made, I think, a very telling point. They said that Medicare has certainty. The Senator from Nevada said that it may not be perfect but at least it has certainty. Mr. President, that is true. The Congress began here with a program, an entitlement for senior citizens, to provide certain medical care--not all care, but certain care for senior citizens. Gradually, over time, that has transformed from an entitlement into an exclusive program. It is Medicare or no care, as of January 1 of this year. 
Up to that point, you had options. You could go outside the Medicare system, if you wanted to, for covered services. As the Senator from Nevada pointed out, it wasn't done very much, but you had the right. That is the point. All of these dire warnings about price gouging and people having to choose between food and medical care, that has been the situation for the last 20 some years. Patients have always had this right to privately contract. It was taken away from them, as a practical matter, on January 1 of this year. That is why I am standing here. I would not be here otherwise. 
What happened was that because the Health Care Financing Administration was writing letters to doctors threatening them that they had to submit a bill to Medicare for anyone who was `Medicare eligible'--obviously, that is everybody over 65--the doctors were worried. They said, `We never had to do this before,' and, as a colleague pointed out, `If the patient doesn't want to have this done, we don't have to do it. They could be treated outside of Medicare. So would you please confirm that, make it absolutely certain in the law?' So I introduced the amendment. It passed overwhelmingly, like 65-35 or so. 
All of us want to give patients the freedom of choice: Even if the right isn't going to be exercised very much, let the patient decide. But what happened was that after that became part of the Balanced Budget Act of last year, as it was being negotiated in its details at the very end of the year, in the middle of the night, the administration officials convinced some House and Senate negotiators that they had to attach a condition onto our amendment; namely, in order for a patient to have this right, they had to find a doctor who would dump all of that doctor's Medicare patients for 2 years in advance, or you could not contract privately. As a practical matter, that eliminated the choice, because very few doctors are going to dump all of their existing Medicare load to just treat a few private contract patients. 
So, as a result, we are now dealing with a new phenomenon. What started as a great program, an entitlement, which people could take advantage of, has now become the exclusive, only way for senior citizens to receive care in our country. As I pointed out earlier, even in England where they have socialized medicine, they have a system whereby, if you don't want to go to the socialized medicine program, you can go to a doctor of your choice. Many people do, and has it ruined the English system of health care? No. If this is going to be such a horrible thing and ruin Medicare, why hasn't it ruined the English system, where this right of private choice always has existed? Why didn't it ruin the Medicare system before January 1, when this right existed? It may not be perfect, but at least there is 
certainty. We are saying the certainty has now gotten to the point where it is a constraint, the denial of a right and the denial of a freedom. In that regard, certainty is less desirable than choice. 
Now, my colleague from Minnesota made an interesting point in concluding. He said doctors could overcharge here and you could actually create two classes of medicine. Mr. President, I think this says a lot, because what it says in the long run is that we are going to have one level of care for senior citizens. We can't predict exactly what that level of care is going to be, but whatever it is, if a senior feels dissatisfied with that level of care, he or she is stuck with it; there is no way out. Even in Great Britain, you have a way out. If you are not satisfied with it, if you don't think it suits your particular needs, you at least have the right to go to the doctor of your choice outside the system. But not in the United States of America. 
We are going to say, `No, no, there has to be only one type of care and it has to be the same for everybody once you hit 65.' What we are saying is that there may be a few people--and I grant it will not be a large number--but there may be a few people who are not satisfied with that, who, for whatever reason, decide they want to have care outside of the Medicare system and they are willing to pay for it. Why deny them that right? This is America. 
One of my colleagues made the point, I think it was the colleague from Arkansas, that this is elitist because some people will pay for their own care. Perhaps you have a patient who has been treated by the same doctor for many years and he just wants to go back to that same doctor even though he would have to privately contract. That could well happen, but I don't call that elitist. I cited the example of a friend of mine, who is not a senior citizen, by the way, but his wife was very, very ill with cancer. He would have spent every nickel that he had, he would have spent his life savings, he would have done anything to save her life. In the end he couldn't, but he went to great lengths to try to save her life. 
As I said, I was successful in getting a compassionate release from FDA so she could be treated with some experimental drugs. When it is your life, or your wife, your spouse, you will do anything when their health care, their life, is involved. Are we going to say to them, in the United States of America, `No, you are stuck with Medicare whether you like it or not,' even though you might be able to go to a great specialist somewhere at some great university who is not taking very many Medicare patients and he doesn't want to take any more Medicare patients but he is willing to treat you? We are saying, `No, we are not going to let that great surgeon, that university research expert, treat you outside of Medicare because we only have one level of care in this country and we don't want anybody to have any better care than anybody else.' 
I don't call that elitist. I call that the denial of the basic American right of freedom. That is why I think we need to get this back to what we are really talking about. 
Let me read again the words, because I find it hard to believe that my colleagues would really vote against these words. This is the amendment we are debating here:  
It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice. 
Those who vote no are saying, no, they should not have that right. It is that simple. 
Finally, perhaps I could refer to some of the antifraud provisions. I had not wanted to take the time to do this, but there has been a suggestion that patients are in jeopardy, that seniors would be in jeopardy because doctors could charge all kinds of extra money. I really don't have the time to read all of this; it is page after page after page. Let me just cite some examples here of some of the things that are included that a physician would have to do in order to enter into this kind of contract, in order to assure that there is no fraud or abuse. And HCFA, Health Care Finance Administration, would have total control over this. The requirements are as follows. 
First of all, a contract would have to be in writing and signed. No claims could be--the contract provides that no party to the contract and no entity on behalf of any party to the contract shall submit any claim or request for payment to Medicare. 
The contract must identify the Medicare-covered professional services and the period, if any, to be covered, but does not cover any services furnished before the contract is entered into for the treatment of an emergency medical condition. So this couldn't be used when the patient is in extremis unless the contract was entered into before the onset of the emergency medical condition. There must be clear disclosure of terms. The contract must clearly indicate that by signing the contract the Medicare beneficiary understands and agrees not to submit a claim to Medicare, agrees to be responsible, whether through insurance or otherwise, to pay for the services, acknowledges that no limits under this title may be charged, acknowledges that Medicare supplemental policies do not make payments for such services, acknowledges that the beneficiary has the right to have such services provided by other physicians or health care practitioners for whom payment would be made by Medicare; that the contract must also clearly indicate whether the physician or practitioner is excluded from participation; the parties can modify the contract if they consent, the health care practitioner must submit a variety of--a whole variety here of things to HCFA, including information to HCFA which makes it clear as to what the charges are, what the services are for which the payment is being made by the patient, and other information that Medicare--HCFA deems necessary to prevent fraud and abuse. It goes on and on and on. I don't need to quote it all. 
The point is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we have before us here also makes reference to and summarizes those provisions. I noted just one of the provisions. I will cite it again, that the legislation we are talking about here must include provisions that are subject to stringent fraud and abuse law, including the Medicare anti-fraud provisions in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. 
The point is, if the existing law antifraud provisions are good enough for the existing law, then it is kind of hard to criticize them as applicable to this. 
So I think it is a red herring to say doctors could somehow gouge patients under this. They are going to be subject to very stringent antifraud provisions, at least as stringent, and frankly more stringent, than those under existing law. So I really don't think that is a fair criticism of what we are trying to do here. 
This is merely a sense of the Senate that people in this country, just because they turn 65, should not be precluded from making the choice--that they are willing to pay for--to be treated outside of the Medicare Program. Most will not want to do so. But who are we to say in those cases in which a person does want to do so that they can't do it, whatever it means to their life or the life of their loved ones? I think that is what is elitist. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could make just a couple of comments in response to the Senator from Minnesota. If an insurance company or plan like Kaiser company has a contract to provide care, they would be obligated to provide the care they contracted to provide. They can't all of a sudden just opt out and say we have decided we don't want to do that anymore or we are going to charge more money for it. I really don't understand the point of the Senator from Minnesota in that regard. 
Second, he argued that under this amendment it could well come to pass, probably would come to pass, that so many physicians would charge so much more that pretty soon people wouldn't be able to afford their medical care. Yet it has also been argued here that very few people would want to take advantage of this; that 92 percent of the people in Medicare are happy with the care that they are getting. I don't think you can have it both ways. I don't think you can argue on the one hand that there would be dire consequences because everybody will want to do this and on the other hand everything is just fine and nobody is going to want to do it. 
The truth of the matter is that probably not very many people will want to do this and therefore it will not have dire consequences on the system. But for those people who do want to do it, it becomes a very important matter to them. They may want to spend whatever they have--whether they have very much or not--in order to get that physician of their choice. 
Let me present an analogy to you, Mr. President, about what the Senators who are arguing in opposition to this are really arguing. 
They said we provided this great health care system for the citizens of the United States, and so it has to be the only system. To be consistent, they should also say we provided a great retirement system for people in this country; it is called Social Security. So in order to prevent anybody from getting anymore money than anyone else in retirement, we are going to provide that under Social Security; that is what you got; you can't go outside; you can't have pension benefits, insurance benefits, stock paying you dividends or money from your kids or whatever. It is the Government plan or no plan, just like they are saying, here it is, Medicare or no care. Same thing, Mr. President. You can see how absurd the proposition is when presented in that way. 
For retirement savings, we acknowledge the fact that people ought to have a choice. They can have the Government plan but they can also exercise their own freedom of choice to provide for themselves as they see necessary. But what our colleagues on the other side are saying is, when it comes to health care, which I argue is even more important to people than money, `No, you don't have that choice, because the Government has decided not only is it going to provide you an entitlement of health care, but it has now decided that is the only thing you can get once you turn 65; that you cannot go outside of that system.' 
That, Mr. President, is what is so wrong with the law that took effect as of January 1 of this year and what we are trying to correct. That is why we need to go on record expressing the sense of the Senate, and I will read it again: 
[Expressing] the sense of the Senate that seniors have the right to see the physician or health care provider of their choice. . . 
I hope my colleagues will support us in that expression.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, this amendment is a sense of the Senate entitled `Freedom of Health Care Choice for Medicare Seniors.' The purpose of this amendment is for Members of the Senate to go on record as supporting the eventual adoption of legislation that will ensure that all seniors have freedom of choice in obtaining health care services for themselves and members of their families. 
As a result of the balanced budget amendment of last year, an amendment went into effect on January 1 that precludes most seniors from having this freedom to contract. While it establishes the principle that they may do so, it puts forth a condition that is virtually impossible for them to satisfy; namely, to find a physician who is willing to dump all of his Medicare patients for a period of 2 years prior to the time that their services are sought. As a result, it is impossible for most seniors to exercise a choice that is theoretically theirs in the law today. 
This proposal to be amended into the Balanced Budget Act is to express our sense that we intend to adopt legislation later that will provide for this right. As a matter of fact, I have introduced legislation, as has Congressman Bill Archer from Texas in the House of Representatives, that would fulfill this commitment. Mine is Senate bill 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. We have 49 cosponsors for this at the moment, and I think number 50 is on the way. Clearly, it is a popular idea because of the expressions of concerns by our senior citizens that they would like to have the freedom to contract for the services they desire. In the House of Representatives, Representative Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has over 190 cosponsors. 
What is this sense of the Senate, and why do we need it? We believe the sense-of-the-Senate amendment here provides that Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to obtain health care from the physician or provider of their choice as do Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans, and that there should be no unreasonable provisions or unreasonable conditions that prevent them from obtaining this care. Moreover, we specifically provide that the assumptions underlying the budget resolutions assume that this legislation will be enacted. 
So what is the problem here? Prior to January 1 of this year, and for all of the time that Medicare has been in effect, Americans have had the ability to go to the physician of their choice, and if that physician did not feel he could treat them under Medicare, or chose not to do so, or they chose not to be treated under Medicare, they would have the choice to contract outside of Medicare. Obviously, they had to pay the bill themselves. 
For most Americans, Medicare is such a good deal that this was rarely taken advantage of. However, there are situations in which a senior citizen might want to take advantage of this requirement. It had always existed. For example, a constituent of mine wrote to me and pointed out that in her community there was only one specialist that she felt could take care of her particular kind of diabetic condition. She went to see that physician, and he said that since she was 65 years of age, she was a Medicare beneficiary, she was Medicare eligible, and since she was Medicare eligible, he would have to submit the bill to Medicare if he treated her, but that he could not take on any more new Medicare patients, that he had as many as he could 
afford to continue to provide care to. She said, `No problem, I'll pay you. You bill me directly, and we will save Medicare the money.' He pointed out--and verified this with the Health Care Financing Administration--that they would assume he had committed fraud if he took care of her, submitted the bill to her, and had her pay him directly. 
Unless the bill is sent to Medicare, the care can't be provided. In effect, it is Medicare or no care. As of January 1 of this year, that is the law of the United States of America, believe it or not. Once you turn 65, you lose a right that all other Americans have, which is to go to the physician of your choice. It is Medicare or no care. You cannot contract outside of Medicare for Medicare-covered benefits. That is fundamentally un-American. 
If you have saved all of your life to provide for health care for yourself, your spouse, and your family, you are going to do anything within your power to help your spouse, let's say, who is ill, and if she wants to go to someone who is not treating new Medicare patients, for example, or is a non-Medicare-treating physician, you are going to spare no expense to save her life. I had this happen to a friend of mine. I was able to get a compassionate release from FDA to get an experimental drug so she could use it in the last few months of her life. Unfortunately, she passed on anyway. Her husband was willing to do anything to preserve her life, go to any lengths. 
Are we going to tell senior citizens in the United States they can't do that, they can't go to the doctor of their choice, that they have to go through Medicare or they can't be cared for at all? If they can't find somebody willing to treat their particular condition under Medicare, that is it, sorry, this is the United States of America, but they don't have that right anymore? 
If you are 64 and a half, of course, you have that right. If you are a Member of Congress, you have that right. If you are in Great Britain, under a socialized medicine system, you have that right. Even in Great Britain, which has socialized medicine, you can either go to that program or contract privately, so long as you pay the bill yourself. That is all we are asking for the United States of America. Yet, under an amendment that the President insisted be part of the Balanced Budget Act of last year, that right has been taken away from seniors in this country. 
All over the country, seniors are beginning to complain because they have figured out what has been taken away. This is one of the first things being brought up in town hall meetings. They ask me, `Why are you taking away the Medicare rights?' I have said, `Look, I didn't do it. I didn't know that agreement had been struck in the middle of the night and snuck into the Balanced Budget Act. Everyone voted for it, and we knew nothing about it. A couple of days later, it was revealed that the President had insisted that this provision go into the law.' 
So, Madam President, I think it is important for the Members of the Senate to go on record in the Budget Act here as supporting the principle of freedom to contract. The measure I have introduced has all kinds of safeguards to prevent fraud and abuse. We can have a good discussion about exactly what those should be. If you have a suggestion on how to make it better, fine with me, let's talk that out. At some point, we will actually bring that legislation to the floor and have that 
debate. 
I think all of us can agree on the basic principle that, A, we should have the freedom of choice to contract with the physician of our choice in this country; B, there should be adequate provisions to prevent fraud and abuse; and, C, we need to get this done as soon as possible. That is what our sense of the Senate calls for, Madam President. I hope that those people who have expressed opposition to this legislation will come forward and debate the issue. Let's have an open public debate, because the people of America need to understand what the Congress and the President did to them last year when it took away this fundamental right. Those of us who believe in the principle of doing everything you can for your loved ones need to support this. 
One final thought before I sit down. This law that is currently in effect is just like saying to seniors on Social Security that the only way you can provide for your retirement, your financial needs, is through the Government's Social Security system; you can't save any money, you can't have any stocks and bonds, you can't have any pension, you can't have any insurance annuities--none of that; it is either the Social Security system, the Government program, or no system. That is what we have said with regard to health care--you either take the Medicare health care program or nothing; you cannot contract outside of Medicare for covered benefits. As I said, it is ludicrous when you present it that way. 
Opponents say that there might be some fraud and abuse here. I think that sells the physicians in this country and our senior citizens very short. I know of nobody more careful about their bills than seniors. I know my mom and dad are. They can tell you whether they were overcharged. We can put provisions in this to ensure that there is no fraud and abuse. I think it is fundamentally wrong for us to deny this right to citizens just because we feel there may be some physician out there who would abuse the system. 
So I conclude by urging colleagues, when we have an opportunity to vote on this, to support this principle again in the Budget Act--and at this point it can only be a principle; it cannot be the effective legislation. We will propose that later. Surely we can support this principle through the sense of the Senate and, at a later time, actually support the legislation that would accomplish the principle. 
Madam President, at this time I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, my amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill (S. 1768) would accelerate the development and deployment of theater missile defense systems. 
Recent revelations that Iran has nearly completed development of two new ballistic missiles--made possible with Russian assistance--that will allow it to strike targets as far away as Central Europe have convinced me that U.S. theater missile defenses must be accelerated in order to counter the emerging Iranian threat. This increased Iranian missile threat has materialized much sooner than expected due to the extensive assistance Russia has provided over the past year. 
According to press reports, development of Iran's 1,300 kilometer-range Shahab-3 missile, which will be capable of reaching Israel, could be completed in 12 to 18 months. Development of a longer-range missile, called the Shahab-4, whose 2,000 kilometer range will allow it to reach targets in Central Europe, could be completed in as little as three years. Both missiles could be armed with chemical or biological warheads. These revelations are part of a string of very troubling disclosures that have surfaced over the past year detailing the extensive aid Russia has provided to Iran. 
A bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives have been working on various legislative approaches to address the Iranian threat for some time. For example, last fall both Houses of Congress passed a Concurrent Resolution which Representative Jane Harman and I submitted expressing the sense of the Congress that the Administration should impose sanctions against the Russian organizations and individuals that have transferred ballistic missile technology to Iran. The annual foreign aid bill passed last year also contains a provision conditioning the release of foreign aid to Russia on a halt to the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Iran. And, Senator Lott and Representative Gilman have introduced legislation that would require that sanctions be imposed against any entity caught transferring goods to support Iran's ballistic missile program. 
In addition to these legislative initiatives, the Administration has engaged in a series of diplomatic exchanges with the Russians. According to press accounts, Vice President Gore has raised the issue with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin on several occasions. President Clinton has discussed the matter with President Yeltsin at the Helsinki summit in March 1997 and at the P-8 summit last June. The President also appointed Ambassador Frank Wisner as his special envoy to hold detailed discussions with Russian officials about the dangers of aiding Iran's ballistic missile program. This is a very serious issue which the Clinton Administration has clearly acknowledged. 
As a result of the Administration's diplomatic efforts, in January Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin signed a decree issuing catch-all export controls on nuclear, biological, chemical, and missile technology. The Russian government has also said it will not assist Iran's missile program. While we all hope this will lead to an end to the transfer of Russian missile hardware and expertise to Iran, I think the jury is still out on whether Moscow will fully comply with its obligations. For example, just one month after Prime Minister Chernomyrdin issued the decree on catch-all export controls, the Washington Times reported that Russia was still providing missile aid to Tehran. Specifically Russia and Iran's intelligence services were reportedly coordinating a visit to Moscow by a group of Iranian missile technicians and Russian missile experts were planning to teach courses in Tehran on missile guidance systems and pyrotechnics. 
It is also worth remembering that Russia promised three years ago to phase out conventional arms sales to Iran and to join the Missile Technology Control Regime. In addition, last March, President Yeltsin assured President Clinton at the Helsinki summit that it was not Russia's policy to assist Iran's missile program. But Russia has given missile aid to Iran in violation of these commitments. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Einhorn summarized this situation well in Senate testimony last year stating, 
We have pressed the Russian leadership at the highest levels and we have been told that it is not Russia's policy to assist Iran's long-range missile program. But the problem is this: There's a disconnect between those reassurances, which we welcome, and what we believe is actually occurring. 
In any event, the United States and our allies must be prepared to protect ourselves from the possibility that Iran will use ballistic missiles armed with nuclear, biological, or nuclear warheads. It is that possibility that this amendment is intended to address. Neither the United States nor Israel will have missile defenses capable of countering the threat from the Shahab-3 or Shahab-4 missiles before those systems are deployed. This amendment provides funding to accelerate the development of some key theater missile defense systems, as well as procurement of items for a third Arrow missile defense battery for Israel. 
In crafting this amendment, I have worked closely with the Defense Department and my colleagues in the House of Representatives. Last month, Deputy Defense Secretary Hamre identified a variety of initiatives which DoD felt were needed to counter the new missile threat from Iran. In a letter to Representative Weldon, Mr. Hamre indicated the Administration felt so strongly about the need for these new initiatives that if additional funding was not provided, that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization would reprogram $100 million from existing missile defense programs for this purpose. Reprogramming missile defense funds would be counterproductive since, in effect, we would be robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
The $100 million of funding for initiatives identified by DoD are the core of this amendment. This funding requested by the Administration would provide: 
$35 million for integration of the Patriot (PAC-3), Navy Upper and Lower Tier, and THAAD radar systems to allow earlier, more accurate cueing that will increase the effective range of these missile defense systems. 
$15 million to accelerate completion of the PAC-3 remote launch capability. Remote launch allows PAC-3 missiles to be deployed at considerable distances from the PAC-3 radars effectively doubling the amount of territory defended. 
$40 million for one additional test flight of the PAC-3 and Navy Lower Tier systems to test their capabilities against longer-range missiles such as the Shahab-3 missile that Iran is developing. 
$10 million to improve interoperability between the Arrow and U.S. TMD systems. 
In addition to providing funding for the programs identified by the Administration, this amendment would also provide $6 million to integrate a variety of sensors and communication systems to provide better, more accurate early warning data from a missile launch, and $45 million to purchase a third radar for the Israeli Arrow system, the first step toward eventually providing a third battery of the system to Israel. 
The proposals contained in this amendment enjoy bipartisan support. Last week, the House National Security Committee passed a bill, which is very similar to the amendment I have offered, by a vote of 45 to 0. It is also important to note that the amendment I have offered simply makes $151 million in funding available to the administration. In order for the Administration to use this funding it must designate it as an emergency requirement. 
In closing, I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens for his support and urge my Senate colleagues to support this amendment which will help ensure that the United States and its allies can take meaningful steps to counter the growing threat from Iran's missile program.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the A Plus Accounts bill that was introduced by the Senator from Georgia, Senator Paul Coverdell. 
This legislation does several things. It would allow more people to save for education in tax-preferred education savings accounts. The savings could be used for higher education, as well as education at the elementary and secondary levels. The bill would extend the existing tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance through the year 2002, and it would provide an exclusion for distributions from qualified state tuition programs. It would also raise the small-issuer exception so that local governments can issue more bonds to finance school construction. 
Perhaps the most important provision of the bill is also the most controversial. I am talking about the provisions that expand the allowable uses of education savings accounts to include elementary and secondary education. And I want to take a few moments to make three brief points about that. 
First, I think it is important to point out that we are not talking about a new subsidy for private or parochial schools. To the contrary, we are talking about allowing families to keep more of what they earn--after all, it is their money--to send their children to the elementary or secondary school of their choice. 
We already go far beyond what would be allowed by this bill when we provide federal financial assistance to students at the college level, including students who attend private or religious institutions. No one argues that such choice harms public colleges or universities. In fact, it is choice and competition that has made our nation's colleges and universities the best in the world. So I am perplexed why anyone would fear giving parents more choice and control at the elementary and secondary levels, as well. That is where the real crisis in education exists today, and it is where choice and competition will do the most good. 
Second, the people who stand to gain the most from this legislation are those of more modest means who might not have the same choice or opportunity without the help that the Coverdell bill would provide. Of the people opting for Catholic schools, for example, 68 percent have annual incomes of $35,000 or less. Wealthier people obviously have the means to send their children to the school of their choice whether they receive a tax break or not. 
Third, providing families with tax incentives for education savings will not decrease federal or state funding for public schools by a single dime. The fact is, Congress is likely to approve increases in funding for education in addition to the incentives that would come with the Coverdell bill. 
Frankly, Madam President, I think it is a big mistake to assume that public schools cannot compete successfully with other institutions. Many public schools have very well-regarded programs--programs that meet or exceed what is offered to students elsewhere--and it is likely that these schools would not only retain their current student body, but add to it with barriers to choice removed. And with additional enrollment would come additional funds for their budgets. 
It is true that failing schools would be forced to improve or face declining enrollment. But is it really our goal to force students with few financial resources to remain in a failing environment? Should they not have the same options that others have to find a school that better meets their needs? 
In recent Senate hearings, low-income parents questioned why the schoolhouse door is often closed to their children--why they are kept from moving their children to schools that can better meet their children's needs? Why their children cannot attend safer schools? They are right to ask these questions. They deserve--their children deserve--access to a quality education. 
In my opinion, the single best thing we could do to improve the quality of education in this country is give parents more choice and control over where they send their children. It is an idea with broad support among the American people. A 1997 poll conducted by the Center for Education Reform found support for school choice among the general public at 82 percent. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies reported support among African Americans at more than 70 percent. It is an idea whose time has come. 
I support the Coverdell legislation.

Mr. KYL. Mr President, I call to the attention of my colleagues an article appearing in the March 9 edition of The New Yorker magazine that offers a chilling account of Russia's offensive biological weapons program. This article is based on an extensive interview with Mr. Ken Alibek, a Russian defector who was once second in command of the Russian offensive biological weapons program. Alibek's description of the Russian BW program is generally considered authoritative by a wide range of U.S. experts. 
The article provides a number of startling details about the Russian offensive BW program, also known as Biopreparat. Most startling of all is just how little we in the United States knew about this program. Despite the fact that Biopreparat was established in 1973--the year after the Soviet Union signed the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and pledged to forego an offensive BW program--and despite intelligence to the contrary, some in the U.S. scientific and arms control communities continued to maintain that Russia was not violating the treaty up to the moment that President Yeltsin admitted otherwise in 1992. 
Mr. President, what the Russians had accomplished by 1991 is frightening. According to Alibek, the Soviet Union had warheads for carrying biological weapons on intercontinental missiles that were aimed at the United States. These warheads could carry smallpox, plague and anthrax. The Soviets had apparently weaponized the Marburg virus--a hemorrhagic virus as gruesome as the Ebola virus--and were ready to begin large scale manufacture of the weapon as the Soviet Union was crumbling apart. Alibek is concerned that scientists may have left Russia with samples of this virus and other deadly bacteria. The possibility that Russian scientists, know-how and biological materials are available to rogue states and terrorists underscores the critical importance of improving our domestic preparedness to respond to BW attacks against the United States. 
We do not know the extent of the Russian biological weapons program today. There is evidence to suggest that a clandestine program continues, hidden away in military facilities run by the Ministry of Defense, which are off-limits to the West. The trilateral process, which was set up by the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia in 1992 and calls for inspections of Russian biological-related facilities, has broken down. It has been years since an inspection took place. The Russians have objected to visits to military facilities. And where inspections occurred, the inspectors faced the same obstacles as U.N. inspectors face in Iraq.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding to me and for sponsoring this amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, and heartily urge my colleagues to support, and I also thank the other Senator from Florida, who has just made an eloquent argument in favor of this amendment as well. 
Madam President, there are three primary points I would like to make in support of the Mack amendment. First of all, this represents the first opportunity that we have had to repeal a portion of the 1993 tax increase that virtually every Republican--maybe every Republican; I will have to go back and look to be sure--voted against. I was a Member of the House at the time and I recall that after the so-called Clinton tax increase of 1993 there was a great uprising in the State of Arizona, especially over the 4.3-cent gas tax increase that was a part of that. I introduced a bill immediately to repeal that 4.3-cent gas tax increase. 
I remember a radio station asked me to go to a service station and talk to people who came by to gas up their cars and trucks. I was amazed at the reaction of the people as they drove up and heard about this increase in the gas tax. They were irate. They were very supportive of my effort to get it repealed which has, up to now, been unsuccessful. Perhaps with the sponsorship of the Senator from Florida, now it will be successful. 
But I must say that Republicans who voted against that tax increase in 1993 but who vote against its repeal today have some answering to do to their constituents. I think this is a symptom of Potomac fever. We oppose a tax increase, especially when it is the agenda of the opposing party, and we go back home and we rail against it. But then too many of our colleagues fail to follow up their rhetoric with action to repeal the tax. 
Now is our opportunity. Where will Republicans stand? I know a lot of my Democratic colleagues will continue to support the tax. They are not about to vote for this repeal, except for certain enlightened Democrats such as the Senator who has just spoken. But where will my Republican colleagues stand, those who opposed the gas tax when it was put into effect, who argued against it, who voted against it, and now have an opportunity to repeal it? Ah, but now they have an opportunity to divide up the money. The longer you are here, the more accustomed you get to spending American taxpayer dollars. After all, you get to go home and show the folks what a wonderful, magnanimous, generous person you are by giving them back some of their money. 
As the good Senator from Virginia just said, States like Arizona and Florida got increases in their percentage in this bill. Yes, that is true. When you start from a very low percentage and you get a good increase in the total dollars, it represents a big increase percentage-wise. But, like my colleagues from Florida, I represent a State, Arizona, which is still a donor State. Something mysterious happens. Arizonans send a dollar to Washington in gas taxes and Federal highway taxes and we get 89 cents back. Something happens to the other 11 cents. 
Here in Washington, DC, it's not so bad. The round trip actually earns them $2 on the $1 they send. Maybe that is because they do not send it so far. We have colleagues from other States, I will not mention them, but some colleagues are here representing constituents who send $1 and they get $2 back, or more than $2 back, and they ask us to be grateful for the fact that we get 90 cents instead of 89 cents, `We gave you an increase.' Madam President, it is not fair. That is the second reason I suggest we repeal this 4.3-cent gas tax. 
We have a policy now in the Congress called devolution. It's a fancy word for `let's give the power back to the States and the local government and to the people.' The Federal Government has gotten too big and too powerful. One way we could do that is by repealing this 4.3-cent gas tax. My colleagues who want to spend the money on highways, all they have to do is go back to their State legislatures and say, Folks, we just repealed the 4.3-cent Federal tax. If you want to tax the people of Montana, Virginia, New York, whatever, 4.3 cents, they will never notice the difference at the gas pump. They will be paying exactly the same for a gallon of gas today as yesterday and tomorrow. Then we can spend the 4.3 cents in Montana or New York or Virginia or whatever the State is. 
Actually, a lot of us would be better off because we do not lose any of that money as it makes the trip to Washington and then comes back. If my State of Arizona wanted to immediately put on a 4.3-cent State gas tax, the State of Arizona would come out very well. We would get to spend that money on our Arizona roads, and maybe the State legislature would do that, but I would rather have them decide that rather than have people here in Washington decide that we are going to retain this tax with the result that my State gets back about 89 cents or 90 cents. So that is the second reason. It is the right thing to do in terms of returning the power back to the people at the lower levels of government so they can decide for themselves how much tax they want to impose upon themselves. 
The third reason is that America is already an overtaxed nation. This last year the taxes, the total tax burden has now gone up well over 38 percent. It is the highest level since 1945: $6,047 for every man, woman, and child in the country. That is over $27,000 for a family of four. We are an overtaxed nation. We do not need this money. We are now in a budget surplus situation. This tax increase was designed to reduce the deficit. The deficit has been reduced and our surplus is going to be, I suggest, at least as much as the money that would be lost as a result of the imposition of this tax. In any event, it has been paid for in the sense that obligations of Government have been reduced correspondingly so it has a neutral budget effect. 
Madam President, I think, since this is a tax that affects every American equally, its repeal would not be for the wealthy. It would have just as much of an effect on the wealthy or the poor or the modest-income or whatever. It would be a very fair way to return some of the hard-working American families' money to them so they could decide themselves how to spend it. I urge support for the Mack amendment to repeal the 4.3-cent Federal gas tax, because, first of all, it is unnecessary, second, because it is unfair; third, because it is contradictory to our policy to return power to the States and the people, and fourth, because it adds an unnecessary tax burden to the already overtaxed families of America. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Mack amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are well aware that an agreement was struck this week by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and the Iraqi Government, led by Saddam Hussein, with respect to the sites that Iraq agreed would be open to unfettered inspection at the conclusion of the gulf war. Let me give a little history first. 
Remember that the United States and the allied forces were prepared to carry the battle further, perhaps even to Saddam 
Hussein himself, but the President of the United States judged that the battle could be called off if the Iraqi Government would agree to a series of commitments to abide by the rule of law in the future. As a result, we stopped our military campaign against the Iraqi Army, and an agreement was entered into between the Iraqi Government and the allied forces under the jurisdiction of the United States in which the Iraqi Government made some very specific promises. The key promise was not to develop any weapons of mass destruction and to destroy everything that they had. 
To implement that commitment, an inspection regime was established, and the Iraqi Government agreed to allow unfettered inspection of its country in order to assure that it was abiding by the agreement not to develop and, indeed, to destroy any weapons of mass destruction that it might already have. 
From the day that agreement was signed, it has been violated repeatedly by the Iraqi Government and Iraqi authorities, and it has been literally, Mr. President, a cat-and-mouse game between the U.N. inspectors under UNSCOM and the Iraqi Government. It seems that unfettered inspection has been permitted until the inspectors get warm--like the old child's game, `Am I getting warm yet?'--and as soon as the inspectors would get warm, then there would be delay and deception and denial and, if it were serious enough, outright barring of inspectors from a site or facility until the offending material had been whisked literally out the back door, in some cases, and then when the site was clean, the front door would open, the inspectors would be invited in and they would find, of course, nothing. That game went on for a long time. Finally, the U.N. inspector said, `Enough, this isn't going to work; every time we get warm, he stops us and we have to find a way to enforce the agreement that Saddam had entered into.' That is when the United States began to consider a bombing campaign as a means of at least attempting to degrade the weapons of mass destruction that Iraq had developed. 
A lot of people felt it probably wouldn't succeed because it is difficult to find those caches of weapons, except for the ones that were disclosed when Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defected to Jordan for a while and indicated where this material was and our inspectors were able to go in and find it as a result of that, Saddam Hussein all of a sudden remembering that he had forgotten to tell us that that existed. 
Except for that instance, we have been unsuccessful in being able to identify much of these stocks. So it was problematic as to whether a bombing campaign would actually result in the destruction of this material. As a result, a lot of people were pushing the administration prior to that bombing campaign to develop a broader strategy that would consist of a wide array of actions that over time could result in addressing the real problem here, which everyone agrees is Saddam Hussein himself. That broader strategy might consist of a series of actions that would destabilize his regime, would put more pressure on him and would eventually perhaps result in a replacement of his Government, not by assassination, which is contrary to American policy, but by means of the assistance of the people of Iraq. 
Since the agreement by the U.N. Secretary General, the need for a resolution from the Congress supporting military action has been, in effect, put on hold, but I suggest that it is only on hold, that there will come a time, sooner or later, when the United Nations will, again, be faced with the question, and the United States as the primary actor here, as to whether or not it is necessary to take some additional action. 
As sure as we are here today, Mr. President, the Iraqis will violate the terms of either the most recently agreed-upon regime for inspection or the remaining principles of inspection which apply to other than the so-called eight Presidential sites in Iraq. That would probably happen if, that is to say, we begin again to get warm, if our inspectors find something that they want to get into further. 
At that point, we will begin to again see denial and deception by the Iraqi Government. At that point, it is going to be relevant again whether or not the American people, the world community and the Congress support action by the administration to deal with the then most recent crisis. If the administration has developed a broad strategy, the bombing campaign only being a part of that strategy, and everyone recognizing that it by itself is not going to solve the problem, but as a part of an overall strategy can contribute to a solution, then the President, I think, will have the support he needs to proceed with the execution of that plan.

Mr. KYL. Now, this document that the 28 advisers--let me indicate who some of these people are, people like former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci; and Caspar Weinberger; and Judge William Clark, former National Security Adviser; Doug Feith, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense; Fred C. Ikle, former Undersecretary of Defense; Bill Kristol; Robert Kagan; Bernard Lewis; Don Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense; and Paul Wolfowitz, as I said; and Richard Perle. They are all, I think, eminently qualified to offer this kind of advice. 
I urge the President to consider the suggestions that are made here, which revolve around preliminarily the principle that military action alone will not force Saddam to comply, that he is the problem, that is, no coup d'etat is likely to succeed in this country and therefore the way to get him out is to create a series of conditions which will enable the Iraqi people themselves to provide the insurrection that will eventually depose him. This might include the following: 
Recognizing a provincial government; restoring safe-haven both in the northern and southern portions of Iraq so that the people there can actually declare themselves free of his influence and control; lifting the sanctions in those areas so that the people can benefit from the economic end, of course, that would result; release frozen Iraqi assets to the Iraqis in exile; facilitating broadcasts from U.S. transmitters to the people of Iraq; removing vestiges of Saddam's `legitimacy' by considering, for example, whether the United Nations should indict him as a war criminal; an air campaign could be a part of this, launched against the Republican Guard divisions which prop him up; and tightening down on the embargo. 
Right now we know the sanctions are of primary concern to him. And if we tighten down on the embargo so that the black market oil sales cannot continue to provide him with significant oil revenues, it will squeeze him further. 
All of these things could eventually create conditions under which the Iraqi people could retake the Government of Iraq from Saddam Hussein. 
So, Mr. President, my concluding point is this: The administration now has some time to develop a strategy which had not been developed prior to the time that it was asking for Congress to support a bombing campaign. If that program is developed, with the help of the Congress--and it makes sense as a broad strategy to deal with Saddam Hussein--the President will have all of the authority and the backing that he needs and deserves in taking action against Saddam Hussein, I would say, when, not if, that is called for, as a result of probable Iraqi violation of some part of the international inspection regime. 
It is a serious business, Mr. President, for us to decide to move beyond a policy of containment to a policy of rollback. It is one which ought to be debated by this body and by the administration. But the time for it has come because, as we have seen, neither the American people nor the Congress were willing to support a half-measures kind of action against Saddam Hussein. We felt something more was required to really deal with the problem. 
As we learned in Vietnam, and as we have learned elsewhere, halfway measures--calibrated bombing attacks, and the like--do not seem to solve the problem. When you go to war, I think the maxim from the gulf war, from the Vietnam war, and the new thinking of military strategists in this country is: When you go to war, you'd better mean it; you have to be able to succeed at what you are doing. 
That probably requires the imposition of overwhelming force and it requires a broad strategy that will get you where you are going. That is why the administration needs to develop this policy, with the assistance of the Congress, and be able to implement it if and when the time for action comes. 
Mr. President, I ask, how much of that remaining time do I have, because I have one more thing I would like to say?

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments today on the subject of bankruptcy reform. It is an issue that we will be dealing with shortly in the Judiciary Committee. The House of Representatives could vote on a reform bill as early as next month. 
Mr. President, bankruptcy filings have been skyrocketing. We have seen a nearly 60 percent increase in personal filings around the country during the last two years, resulting in a discharge of about $40 billion in debt. In Arizona alone, Chapter 7 filings have increased a staggering 81 percent during the same period. 
The number of bankruptcy cases filed in my home state last year exceeded the previous record that was set back in 1990, when our real estate market was in serious trouble. What is particularly alarming about the number of filings today is that they are occurring in relatively good economic times. 
Now let me say at the outset that there are obviously some people who legitimately need the relief that Chapter 7 was set up to provide. A serious illness or death in the family may have wreaked havoc on the family finances. Maybe there has been a fire or flood that has wiped out the family business or home. In cases like that, where there is extraordinary hardship, there ought to be an opportunity to seek relief and a fresh start. No one disputes that. And I suspect that most creditors are willing to work with someone when such tragedy strikes. 
The problem is, too many people appear to be abusing the system of late. A recent study conducted in Phoenix found that a significant number of people who file for relief under Chapter 7 actually have the ability to pay back some, or even all, of what they owe. Let me say that again: they actually have the ability to repay some or all of their debts. 
A study by Michael Staten of the Georgetown School of Business suggests that as many as 25 percent of Chapter 7 filers could pay at least 30 percent or more of their non-housing debt. But filing under Chapter 7 allows them to escape all of such debt, regardless of their ability to repay. 
Now I know defenders of the status quo prefer to put the blame on creditors, suggesting that they extend credit far too easily, even to individuals who may have difficulty repaying their debt. But let us keep a few points in mind. First, the vast majority of people--an estimated 96 percent--pay their bills on time. So creditors must be doing something right. I am sure that if there were a way for creditors to weed out more of the riskiest accounts, they would do so. 
Second, no one is forced to open a credit account, take a loan, or buy something on credit. In fact, millions of hard-working Americans make due without many of the things they would like to have because they cannot afford them--even on credit. Many others delay a purchase until they are better situated to repay. 
Third, and perhaps this is the most important point I would make: The people who need credit most are not the wealthiest Americans, but those with moderate or low incomes. If creditors tighten up credit too much, it will be the people closer to the margins--those who need it most--whose access to credit will be impeded. 
In my view, the issue really boils down to this: personal responsibility. If someone freely accepts the terms of a credit account, he or she ought to abide by those terms when it comes time to meet the obligations and pay back what is owed. If extraordinary circumstances strike, debtors ought to work in good faith with their creditors to establish a reasonable repayment plan, assuming they have the means to do so. 
The irresponsible thing is for people to take something on credit that they have no intention of paying for. And our laws should not sanction that sort of behavior. 
Mr. President, let me turn for a moment to a few different cases that illustrate the point I am making here. These are cases that were profiled in recent news reports. 
First, there was the case of a New York couple with three children. The husband was on disability. They could easily have qualified for a Chapter 7 discharge of their debt, but they did not want to walk away from their obligations. They chose to repay what they could under a Chapter 13 payment plan, and they are now paying $375 of their $2,125 monthly income to satisfy part of their debt. 
An Arizona teacher ended up with $45,000 worth of credit-card debt, but she was determined to find a way to avoid bankruptcy altogether. She put it this way: `When I signed my name, that was my promise.' She found a consumer-credit counseling service to help her through tough times, and she is now on her way to paying back her debt and restoring her credit. 
Compare the New York couple and the Arizona teacher to debtors who reportedly used credit to buy several thousand dollars worth of computer equipment, furniture, and an entertainment center. Shortly after buying the goods, they sold them, pocketed the proceeds, 
and without applying anything toward their bills, filed for Chapter 7 to erase their debts. 
In another case, a couple allegedly ran up more than $2,000 on a charge card at the very time they were involved in foreclosure proceedings on their home. They apparently knew they could not avoid the foreclosure or pay off the credit-card charges they were incurring. Yet they went ahead and ran up their charge cards with the expectation that they could escape the obligation to repay their debt under Chapter 7. 
Mr. President, in the first two instances, we had individuals who stepped up to the plate and tried to make good on their obligations. In the latter two cases, we have individuals who seem to be abusing the system, running up debt they had no intention of repaying. And the way the law works now, it is the abusers who benefit most. And that abuse costs those who responsibly pay their bills as much as $400 per household a year. 
What is fair about allowing people who have the ability to pay back some of their debt to walk away free and clear, while the vast majority of people pay their bills on time? What is fair about letting some people avoid their obligations for no good reason, while others who experience credit problems make some effort to repay? I want to emphasize that we need to find a way to deal with people who have the ability to repay their debt, not those who are in such dire straights that their lives are totally upended. 
Probably the best thing we could do would be to establish a simple, up-front means test to direct bankruptcy filers to the chapter of the Bankruptcy Code that best meets their needs. I am talking about setting up an objective, administrative test to separate those who are in severe financial straits and truly need complete relief under Chapter 7 from those who are able to repay some or all of their debts. 
Here is how this front-end approach would work. People who have annual incomes of less than 75 percent of the national median family income could choose between a Chapter 7 discharge and a Chapter 13 repayment plan, just as they could now. It would be their choice. In other words, there would be no change at all for people with modest incomes. 
But for people who have higher incomes, a second test would be applied: could they repay all of their secured and priority debts and at least 20 percent of their unsecured debts over five years? If so, they would have to establish a repayment plan. If not, they could still get protection under Chapter 7. It is as simple and straightforward as that. 
We should also create an incentive for people who have a pretty good idea that they are running into financial trouble to avoid running up additional debts they will not be able to repay. We could do that by making sure that debts run up on the eve of bankruptcy filings--within 90 days of the filing--are non-dischargeable. 
A longer period of time for higher income debtors to pay off their debts is also worth considering, as is a stop to the so-called `cram downs' of goods to values below which any other American would have to pay. 
Mr. President, if someone has the ability to repay, he or she should have to do so. Bankruptcy protection ought to be reserved for those who truly need it. I intend to work in the Judiciary Committee with Senators Hatch and Grassley to craft common sense bankruptcy-reform legislation that addresses these and other concerns. I hope my colleagues will join this effort to ensure that a reform bill can be enacted this year.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Milton Friedman once said he would rather have a $1 trillion budget that is way out of balance than a $2 trillion budget that is in balance. I think his point is even more poignant now than when he made it several years ago. 
If we manage to balance the unified budget this year--and most recent revenue trends suggest we will--we will do so by taxing and spending at a level of about $1.75 trillion. That is a level of spending that is 25 percent higher than when President Clinton took office just 5 years ago. 
Despite the claim President Clinton made in his State of the Union Address that we have the smallest Government in 35 years, the fact is that the Government has never been bigger--never. And it will continue to grow by leaps and bounds if Congress approves the myriad of new spending proposals that President Clinton is proposing in his latest budget. 
It seems to me that although we may have succeeded in balancing the budget, we still have two very different visions of where we should be headed in this country. Is it a balanced budget that is the paramount goal, even if it comes with substantially higher taxes and more spending? Or is the real goal of a balanced budget to be more responsible with people's hard-earned tax dollars--to limit Government's size and give the people more choices and more control over their lives? Before we try to answer those questions, let us give them a little context. 
As I mentioned, the Federal Government has grown 25 percent larger in just the last 5 years. It spends the equivalent of $6,700 for every man, woman, and child in the country every year. And that is the equivalent of nearly $27,000 for the average family of four. But all of that spending comes at a tremendous cost to hard-working taxpayers. 
The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America saw its combined Federal, State, and local tax bill climb to 38.2 percent of income last year--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That is more than the average family spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. Put another way, in too many families one parent is working to put food on the table while the other is working almost full time just to pay the bill for the Government bureaucracy. 
Perhaps a different measure of how heavy a tax burden the Federal Government is imposing would help shed some light here. Consider that Federal revenues this year will claim about 19.9 percent of the Nation's income, its gross domestic product. Next year, the tax take will climb to 20.9 percent, according to the administration's projections. That would be higher than any year since 1945. It would be only the third year in our Nation's entire history that revenues have exceeded 20 percent of the national income. 
As if taxes were not high enough, President Clinton is proposing to raise them again. He is proposing a tax increase of $98 billion, which would more than offset the modest amount of tax relief that we approved just 7 months ago. It is worth noting that the new taxes the President proposes are not needed to balance the budget. We have more than enough revenue to do that given the economy's performance in the last year. The tax increases are intended to finance dozens of new spending programs--$125 billion worth of new spending over the next 5 years. 
More taxes, more spending, and more Government. That is just the opposite of where I believe we ought to be headed. For me, there is no great achievement in balancing the budget if it means that hard-working families continue to be overtaxed. There is no great achievement in a balanced budget if the Government continues to grow, seemingly without limits, taking choice and freedom away from the people in the process. 
Mr. President, this is the point that I think Milton Friedman was making. A balanced budget is not the only goal, or even the highest goal. A balanced budget is merely the means of right-sizing the Government so that it is more respectful of hard-working taxpayers' earnings and their desire to do right by their own families. That is where our paramount concern should be--with families. 
To those who are suggesting we abandon plans for another tax relief bill this year, I say this: Let us not lose sight of our true objective. Families are overtaxed. The Government is still too big. We were sent here to help hard-working families, not to keep them saddled with high taxes or to add to that burden with more spending and more taxes. We will do the right thing by limiting the size of Government so that families have more freedom and more income left in their pockets. 
Mr. President, thank you. And I thank the Senator from West Virginia for being patient. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have stated before that I believe there are many things Congress should do to reform the way campaigns for federal office are financed. 
Last year's hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, confirmed that the first thing is to ensure enforcement of existing laws. The Committee investigated what appear to be an orchestrated campaign in the last Presidential election to evade restrictions on foreign contributions, and an apparent effort by Communist China to illegally influence our electoral process. It is already illegal to `launder' contributions and accept campaign contributions from foreign sources. The first step Congress should take, therefore, is to ensure that current campaign finance laws are vigorously enforced. 
But we can--and should--do more. I believe any reform of our electoral process should be based on some key principles. Specifically, our laws should: be clear, simple, and enforceable; maximize disclosure of who contributed what to whom; place public interest over special interest; ensure voluntary participation for all; and most importantly, protect our constitutional right to free speech--unregulated by the government. Politicians must never be able to define the times, methods or means by which their constituents can criticize them. 
Specifically, I support the following campaign finance reforms in the McCain-Feingold bill: requiring more timely and detailed disclosure of campaign funding and spending; toughening the penalties for violations of campaign law; tightening the restrictions on fundraising on federal property; strengthening the restriction on foreign money; prohibiting campaign contributions from minors (which often mask attempts at `double donations' by adults); and, curbing the advantages of incumbents by prohibiting mass mailings at taxpayer expense during an election year. 
Additionally, I support several reforms not included in the bill, such as: requiring candidates to raise a majority of their campaign contributions from within their state, ensuring local support over national special interests; insisting that all political activities be funded with voluntary contributions and not coerced through mandatory union dues. 
The two primary reasons I have not supported the current version of McCain-Feingold are (1) its failure to ensure that all political contributions are voluntary, and (2) its provisions unconstitutionally limiting free speech. 
Concerning free speech, the McCain-Feingold bill in the view of many constitutional experts would effectively prohibit so-called `issue-ads' that mention a candidate's name within 60 days of a federal election. The bill would force groups that now engage in issue advocacy such as non-profit entities organized under 501(c)(3) and (c)(4) of the IRS Code to create new institutional entities--PACs--to be able to `legally' speak within 60 days before an election. Separate accounting procedures, new legal costs, and separate administrative processes would be imposed on these non-profit groups, merely so that their members could preserve their First Amendment rights to comment on a candidate's record. I believe this violates free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment. Elected politicians should not be given the right to regulate or forbid criticism by constituents during a campaign. 
While there was an attempt to modify certain provisions of the McCain-Feingold `speech specifications' during the debate on campaign finance reform, the proposed compromise still placed unconstitutional restrictions on free speech about politicians by allowing congressional control over the timing and funding sources of communications merely because they contained the name of a member of Congress. In short, the compromise was not truly a `compromise' but rather a constitutional infirmity infringing on free speech about politicians. 
While I believe McCain-Feingold is motivated by the best of intentions, and I have commended my colleague John McCain for his effective leadership on this difficult issue, I cannot support legislation that in my view does not protect our constitutional rights nor guarantee voluntary participation in the political process for all.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address last month, President Clinton urged Congress to approve his request to pump billions of dollars into the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help stabilize Asian economies. He justified his request by saying that `preparing for a far off storm that may reach our shores is far wiser than ignoring the thunder 'til the clouds are just overhead.' 
There is something to be said for trying to deal with problems before they grow too large--before they engulf us. We will have a debate about the propriety of the IMF request in the weeks ahead. But I would suggest that it is not just the IMF that is attempting to deal with an approaching storm. 
Mr. President, millions of Americans are also looking ahead to be sure they can cope with unforeseen threats to their own family's future financial security. Some people are trying to create a nest egg for their retirement years. Some take out a life-insurance policy or buy an annuity to ensure that a spouse or child is taken care of when they are gone. Others are looking for a way to pay death taxes without creating too much hardship for their families. Whatever the coming storm might be, they are trying to find a way to prepare. And most of us would consider that to be good planning--something the federal government would want to encourage. 
Unfortunately, while the Clinton administration eagerly argues the benefits of pouring billions of dollars into the IMF to help other countries, it cannot seem to see a benefit in helping our own citizens to ward off their own personal storm clouds. I am referring to the provisions in the President's proposed budget that would impose significant tax increases on people who try to save and invest for the future, including people who take out life insurance or buy annuities to protect themselves and their families. 
President Clinton's budget calls the existing tax treatment of life insurance and annuities `unwarranted.' But the Washington Post has identified the President's proposed changes as an effort to `slam [the] middle class.' 
Let us put this issue in context. Personal savings rates in our country have been on the decline since 1981, when they stood at 9.4 percent. Some say that was respectable by international standards. By 1992, the savings rate had declined to 6.2 percent, and it has plunged during the Clinton years. As of last November, the personal savings rate stood at 3.8 percent--the lowest since the Great Depression. In other words, people are not setting much aside for their future needs, including retirement. 
Add to that the problems we all know are coming in the Social Security system. The experts are telling us that Social Security recipients currently receive, on average, benefits equal to 43 percent of their pre-retirement earnings. But then they point out that only 70 percent of that amount is fully funded for future retirees, which means that unless taxes are raised substantially or additional funding is found, retirees in the future will only get a benefit that amounts to less than 30 percent of their pre-retirement income. 
In other words, retirees in the future are likely to experience a significant decline in their standard of living unless they find some way to supplement their Social Security benefits. That means saving and investing more, contributing to an IRA, buying an annuity, or taking out a good life insurance policy. We ought to make it as easy as possible for people to do that. 
However, the Clinton budget means to take us in the opposite direction. For example, it would impose new taxes on individuals who substitute one insurance policy for another policy that better meets their needs. We are talking here about new taxes, primarily on households with incomes under $75,000. Many people in this group work for employers who do not offer, or who have terminated, a retirement plan. So unless they find some other way to protect themselves, they could be out in the cold when they retire. 
The proposed budget would make it harder for businesses to protect themselves with business life insurance. It seems to me entirely reasonable that a business would want--and need--insurance to minimize the costs that would result from the death of a key employee. That is particularly true of small businesses, whose size means that so much of its success depends upon a few individuals. 
The Clinton budget would overturn so-called Crummey powers, making it harder for moderate income families to even pay death taxes. That alone sets up a major confrontation with many of us in Congress who believe that death taxes ought to be eliminated altogether. 
These substantive problems with the Clinton plan come on top of what many of us consider a reneging by the President on last year's budget agreement. Only seven months after entering into that agreement, which provided for very modest tax relief--relief amounting to $95.3 billion over five years--the President is proposing a net tax increase of $98.1 billion. In other words, the entire amount of tax relief approved just seven months ago would be reclaimed in one fell swoop. 
Not only does that back track on the promise to provide tax relief, but it comes at the same time that the President is proposing to bust the spending limits that were established in last year's agreement. Spending levels would exceed the agreed-upon limits by more than $37 billion. 
Mr. President, the federal government is collecting record amounts of tax revenue, primarily as a result of robust economic growth. We do not need another tax increase, let alone a tax increase that singles out the very tools people need to protect themselves against threats to their personal security. We must reject the unwarranted tax increases proposed in this budget, and instead consider tax policies that will make it easier for people to save and invest. Families need tax relief, not new burdens.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, for the very thoughtful and determined way that he has handled the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reform effort. 
Had he simply bowed to calls from some on the other side of the aisle to sweep problems with the IRS under the rug and rush the IRS reform bill to a vote, we probably would not have had the chance to shed light on the serious abuses that innocent spouses have experienced at the hands of the IRS. And we certainly would not have the chance to ensure that an effective fix for innocent spouses is included in the IRS reform legislation. 
I think it is important to say at the outset that most IRS employees are law-abiding and professional, and most of them deal fairly with taxpayers. It is important to remember, too, that the IRS has been given the difficult and thankless task of administering a Tax Code that is exceedingly complex, filled with contradictory provisions, and open to differing interpretations. But since the IRS has been given such tremendous power--power that can bankrupt families, put people out of their homes, and ruin lives--any abuse of that power cannot be tolerated. 
Mr. President, last December, I hosted a Town Hall meeting and a series of other events in Arizona to solicit public comment about how best to reform the IRS. One of the people I heard from was a woman who divorced in late 1995. While she paid her taxes in full and on time during the last two years of her marriage, her husband did not. The IRS ultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse did not pay. 
About two weeks after hearing from her--on December 19--I sent Chairman Roth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform bill, and on that short list was a recommendation to make innocent-spouse relief easier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, or at least to all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill. 
So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused on the issue of innocent-spouse protection. The hearing held by the Committee just yesterday revealed just how seriously people can be abused. The Committee heard from several separated or divorced women who, like my constituent, had been pursued by the IRS for tax debts run up by their former husbands. 
Mr. President, husband and wife are equal partners in a marriage. Financial obligations are a shared responsibility, and appropriately so. We need to be careful not to undermine the commitment that people have made to each other, or we may unintentionally create new incentives for couples to divorce merely to limit their tax obligations. That is how the marriage penalty was born--something we will need to fix later this year. 
But there are unique circumstances that arise from time to time that make it inappropriate to hold one spouse liable for taxes that are primarily attributable to the other spouse. Those circumstances seem to arise far more frequently than one might think. One estimate by the General Accounting Office suggests that the IRS tries to collect taxes from the wrong spouse after a separation or divorce in at least 50,000 cases a year. 
One of the women who testified before the Finance Committee yesterday was a fourth-grade teacher from Florida who divorced back in 1995. Her husband--himself a former field auditor for the IRS--has reportedly failed to file the couple's tax returns for 1993 and 1994. When he did later file joint returns, he allegedly forged her signature. The IRS has now put a lien on her home, while he is apparently paying just $200 to $300 per month toward the debt. 
A widowed mother of five who has been on and off food stamps testified before the Committee. The IRS said she owes more than $527,000. 
A disabled nurse has a lien put on her home for taxes dating back to the 1960s, even though her divorce decree explicitly stated that she was not responsible for her former husband's debts. 
The problem is that, while the IRS is targeting these women, it is apparently failing to pursue their former husbands with equal vigor. There are cases where men, too, are the primary focus of the IRS's collection efforts, but this is predominately a problem that affects women. Nine out of 10 innocent spouses are women. Maybe that is because they are more likely to pay up when confronted by the IRS. Maybe it is because women sometimes have fewer resources available to defend themselves. In either case, singling out women for abusive collection efforts is just plain wrong. 
One solution might be simply to repeal the joint liability rules. Maybe liability ought to be proportionate to each spouse's earnings during the marriage. I understand the Committee is looking at a range of options. One way or the other, though, we have got to solve this problem and get the IRS off the backs of women whose only offense is that they took their husband's word that their finances were in order. And we ought to be sure that whatever we do extends back retroactively. 
Mr. President, I am obviously very appreciative of the fact that Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee have focused on this very important issue. And again, I want to thank Chairman Roth for resisting calls from the other side to merely rush ahead with an IRS reform measure before the Committee could deal with the innocent-spouse issue. I look forward to working with the Committee to ensure that an effective solution to this problem is included in the IRS reform bill before final passage.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do not doubt Dr. Satcher's competence as a physician, scholar, and medical researcher. However, serious questions on two important issues have arisen during Senate debate on his nomination to be U.S. Surgeon General. 
I am concerned about Dr. Satcher's position on partial birth abortion. The vast majority of Americans (84 percent, according to a 1996 Wirthlin poll), a majority of the Senate and U.S. House, and the American Medical Association support banning partial birth abortion. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has said that there is `no way to see partial birth abortion as a medical necessity * * *' It is clear that Dr. Satcher's view on this controversial procedure is out of the mainstream of public and medical opinion. Since Dr. Satcher is apparently willing to subordinate mainstream medical judgment to politics in this instance, I have concerns that he may do so on other important health issues as well. 
I am also troubled that, as administrator of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Satcher approved a questionable medical research project in Africa and Asia. The researchers gave one group of HIV-infected pregnant women placebos while another group received AZT, a drug known to decrease by 67 percent the probability that the unborn children would be infected by the HIV virus. A September 18, 1997 editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that this research was `unethical.' 
The editorial explains that the reason the code of medical ethics is unambiguous with regard to the investigators' primary responsibility to care for the human subjects of scientific testing `is due to the strong temptation to subordinate the subjects' welfare to the objectives of the study.' The editorial concludes that the `research community must redouble our commitment to the highest ethical standards, no matter where the research is conducted.' 
As the `nation's doctor,' the U.S. Surgeon General should embody the highest professional and ethical standards. He or she should clearly reflect the views of a majority of Americans and the medical community. Because Dr. Satcher's views on these two issues raise doubts in my mind--and because, after three years without a Surgeon General, it is unclear whether the position is necessary--I have decided to resolve my doubts against his confirmation. If the president strongly believes the country needs a Surgeon General, I am sure there are thousands of well-qualified candidates whose nominations would not raise these issues.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with the federal government apparently on the verge of running its first unified budget surplus in nearly 30 years, many people are beginning to ask what comes next? What should happen to the budget surplus when it materializes? Should we spend it? Should we begin to pay down the national debt? Or should we provide hard-working Americans with meaningful, long overdue tax relief? 
Before we try to answer those questions, it would be worthwhile to recall how we got here. Remember, it was not that long ago--in fact, it was as recently as February of 1995--that President Clinton submitted a budget that would have locked in annual deficits in the range of $200 billion for the foreseeable future. A unanimous Senate rejected the Clinton budget on May 19, 1995. And from that point on, the debate took a fundamental turn from whether to balance the budget, to how to balance it. 
During the last three years, we have begun to slow federal spending growth. We eliminated 307 mostly small federal programs. But perhaps the most decisive factor has been what we did not do. We did not impose another large tax increase on already overtaxed families and businesses. And that gave people enough room to do things to invigorate the economy. 
In fact, the economy has outperformed just about everyone's expectations, producing tens of billions of dollars in unanticipated revenues to the Treasury to close the budget gap. When the budget agreement passed last year, for example, unified budget deficits were projected to go from $67 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $90 billion in fiscal year 1998. But as it turns out, the fiscal year 1997 deficit came in at only $22 billion, and it is projected to amount to just $5 billion in the current year. The unexpected turnaround is due almost entirely to the economy's performance, and it comes in spite of the substantially increased spending allowed by the 1997 budget agreement. 
Whatever we ultimately decide to do with a unified budget surplus--and I would caution that projections of a surplus are just that, projections--we ought to be sure that it sustains the economic growth that has gotten us to where we are today. 
Mr. President, the suggestions that have been made about how to handle a budget surplus generally fall into four categories: Apply it to new or existing federal spending programs; use it to strengthen and improve Social Security for future generations; apply it toward the national debt; or return it to the American people in the form of tax relief.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleague from Nebraska for the eloquent remarks that he just made, to say that I totally agree with his analysis of the situation. He is a student of this, both because of his committee assignments and the way in which he has dedicated himself to study these issues. I think he has contributed significantly to the debate that we in Congress are going to have to have on this subject. I commend him for devoting that time this morning to this important subject. 
I would like to speak to a different subject today.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think it is time for some of us in the Congress, particularly some of us who have spent a lifetime in the judicial process, to comment upon what has been occurring in the last few days with respect to the special counsel investigating the matter of the President and various affairs in which the President may or may not have been involved. 
This is a most serious matter and I think the time has come for people who believe in the judicial process, who believe in the rule of law, and who believe ultimately in our justice system in this country, to speak out against those who are deliberately attempting to undermine that process. We have something going on today which runs counter to the entire history of the United States of America, a country which is based upon the rule of law, which has established a three-branch Government in which each branch respects the other and in which we support each other because we understand that an attack on one of these branches is, in effect, an attack on the entire Government. 
We have established certain processes for attempting to deal with wrongdoing in our country. One of them is the process of investigating potential crimes in high places through the independent counsel statute, a statute that has not been without controversy in the past but which has been used to probe potential conflicts of interest and criminal behavior in each of the last administrations, many times resulting in indictments or prosecution. 
I will get back to the point in a moment, but some of us have tried to improve the way that statute works. But the way to do that is to do it in the legislative process with calm and deliberate debate, to ensure that justice in the end is always done. 
What we have today, instead of an effort to look at the independent counsel statute to see where it might need to be modified to operate more appropriately, we have the same kind of tactic being employed by the highest levels of the White House that is employed in typical murder or rape or assault cases where the person charged attempts to defend himself by attacking the prosecution, by attacking the corrupt police, or by attacking the victim's credibility and reputation. That is what is happening today by key defenders of the President, including the President's lawyer. 
Rather than coming out with the President's version of the facts--and he alone knows what the facts are in their entirety, with respect to the matters that have been recently carried in the press, the administration--rather, his lawyers, have chosen to tell him to keep quiet while they attack the judicial process that is underway to try to determine the facts and to bring to justice whoever needs to be brought to justice. The most recent deliberate attempt here is to specifically attack the reputation and credibility and actions of the Special Counsel, Judge Kenneth Starr. Judge Starr cannot defend himself because he is under orders not to talk about what he is doing. The very thing that the President's lawyers accuse him of doing, of talking too much, he cannot, and he is not. Someone has to stand up and say the process, the judicial process, and the people who are doing their best to make that process work, need to be defended. 
I rise today to say it is time to stop attacking Judge Starr publicly and in the media. If you have a beef with him, go to his supervisor, in this case Attorney General Reno, or to the judges who can determine whether or not there is any improper activity within his office. But don't use as a defense in the case an attack broadly upon the prosecutor and his individual reputation and credibility. Because he cannot defend himself. 
I said I had a background in law. I practiced law for 20 years, including practice in the United States Supreme Court. One of my law partners was a former Solicitor General of the United States, someone who, as a matter of fact, was well acquainted with Judge Kenneth Starr, who also was a Solicitor General of the United States. That is the highest position that a lawyer can achieve in this country with the exception of being appointed to the bench or being the Attorney General of the United States. He is the Government's lawyer in the Supreme Court. That is what Kenneth Starr was. Then he himself was elevated to the bench. 
He has had a solid reputation all his life as a moderate, intelligent, capable and fair person. But now, because he is investigating the President, the President's own lawyer and his attack dogs in the media programs have decided to go after the reputation of this man who, as I said, can't defend himself. Those of us who have spent our careers in the law understand that you cannot undermine the law repeatedly and expect to end up having justice in this country. That is why lawyers are taught to respect the judiciary and not to attack it directly. If you have a complaint, as I said, you go into court and try to prove your case. If you can, fine. But if you can't, then you should not be talking about it in public. 
What has been happening recently? The President's lawyer, David Kendall, and people like Paul Begala, connected to the administration, have accused Independent Counsel Judge Starr of leaks. One of the things that was done recently is the filing of a letter by David Kendall, released to the public on Friday, which makes several bold allegations. Let me repeat what some of them are. He says the leaking of the past few weeks is `intolerably unfair.' He continues, `These leaks make a mockery of the traditional rules of grand jury secrecy.' And who does he attribute the leaks to? He says Mr. Starr's office is `out of control. . . . The leaking by [Mr. Starr's office] has reached an intolerable point.' 
These are unfair and unfounded accusations and somebody needs to respond to them. As I said, Kenneth Starr is very limited in what he can say publicly. He did respond in a letter to attorney Kendall and what he said in that letter, essentially is as follows. He said, first, and I am quoting from his letter to Mr. Kendall: 
First, you elevate mere suspicion to specific accusation without any facts other than the press's often misleading attribution of sources. 
I would make the point that is precisely what administration spokesmen are asking us to be careful about doing, and why personally I have absolutely refrained from responding to press inquiries about whether I believe these charges or do not believe them or what might have happened. Because I don't know. All we have is what has been reported in the media and I cannot judge whether that is true or not, and I should not express it publicly before the process is complete. The administration has been urging us to withhold our opinions until we do know. Well, I have been abiding by their admonishment, but they have not been doing it with respect to Ken Starr. As he says, they have `elevated mere suspicion to specific accusation without any facts,' other than what has been reported in the media.  
Second, [Kenneth Starr says] the timing of your letter--arriving in the midst of what appears to be an orchestrated plan to deflect and distract this investigation--undermines your expression of outrage. 
Certainly I think anyone would have to agree with that, given the fact that it is now an acknowledged fact that the administration has been orchestrating a campaign to discredit Ken Starr. I refer you to the New York Times newspaper today, Headline, `President's Aides Expand Offensive to Counter Starr. Prosecutors Denounced As Corrupt and Accused of Leading a Witch Hunt.' Somebody has to defend this process. 
The third thing that Mr. Starr said in his letter in response to Mr. Kendall was: 
[W]e are aware that as of several days ago, the President's defense attorneys had most if not all of the material information (whether true or not) set forth in [Friday's] New York Times article. 
This had to do with the leaks. In other words, what Judge Starr was saying is that the President's own lawyers had talked to the people who had testified in the grand jury, at least those people who were connected in any way with the administration, and knew what had been said in the grand jury. The implication, of course, is that it is the White House and its lawyers themselves who could be just as likely the leakers as anyone in the special prosecutors office. When a witness testifies before the grand jury the witness is not constrained as to what he or she can say thereafter. And you have seen some witnesses go in, testify, and they come out and talk to the press about what they said. So these leaks could be coming from all number of people, from the witnesses themselves to the very people in the White House and the White House lawyers' group who are complaining about the leaks today. 
In fact, I would suggest it is most unlikely that the source was Judge Starr's office. 
He continues: 
In my service as independent counsel, particularly with regard to secrecy of the grand jury, I have insisted on a high commitment to professional conduct. I have expressed this commitment to you repeatedly. From the beginning, I made the prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the office. It is a firing offense, as well as one that leads to criminal prosecution. In the case of each allegation of improper disclosure, we have thoroughly investigated the facts and reminded the staff that leaks are intolerable. 
Then Mr. Starr makes clear he has no reason to suspect anyone in his office of leaks after those investigations by saying: 
I have no factual basis, as you likewise do not have, even to suspect anyone at this juncture. You do an extreme disservice to these men and women and to the legal profession and the public by your unsupported charges. 
Mr. President, I agree with Judge Starr that this does a disservice, both to the people who are doing their best to uphold the laws of the United States and to his effort generally to get at the truth here. He is supervised by the Attorney General of the United States, and he is supervised by a three-judge court, the members of which have been appointed by Presidents Johnson, Nixon and Reagan. If there is any wrongdoing, they can see to it that it is stopped and the appropriate people punished in whatever way is appropriate. But instead, the White House has chosen to make this a media campaign rather than to focus on how any leaks might be stopped within the judicial process. 
As a matter of fact, we know, because recently Lucianne Goldberg, one of the people who had access to the tapes, disclosed the fact that she herself had leaked a lot of this information. She had the tapes from Linda Tripp, which were given then to the special prosecutor. So it does not follow that simply because leaks occurred that it had to come from the special prosecutor's office. Indeed, she herself said, `I told people about this. It wasn't Kenneth Starr.' 
So why then do we have this concerted effort on the part of the President's own lawyer to discredit Judge Starr and his investigation? The reason ought to be obvious. Do anything you can to undermine the prosecution in order to cast discredit upon its efforts so that if anything ever comes of the independent counsel's investigation and the President actually has evidence presented against him in this matter, it will be previously discredited information. 
As I said, I think it is time for those of us who have some respect for the judicial process and for this individual himself, Judge Kenneth Starr, to make it clear to the American people that the judicial process must be respected, must be supported and must be upheld if we are to ensure that justice prevails in this country and that it ought to discredit the people who are attacking that system if the way in which they do it is so clearly designed to affect public opinion, as it appears to have been done in this case, rather than to get at the facts. 
As I said, there is a process available, if you have evidence that someone in the prosecutor's office has engaged in conduct, to take that to the appropriate authorities, make your case and have them act in the appropriate, responsive fashion. It is not at all certain that that is what the administration is attempting to do in this case. 
Let me conclude with this point, Mr. President. I think all of us in the Senate are impressed with the awesome responsibility that we have under the Constitution to withhold our own independent judgment because of the fact that at least, theoretically, there is a potential for an impeachment proceeding in any case involving accusations of the type that have been made in this case. 
As I said, I have withheld my judgment, because I have no idea whether these things are true or not, and I am not going to indicate whether I think they are true or not. In fact, I am going to wait until, in effect, the information is presented to us, if it ever is. I think that others need to make that same commitment. Let's see how the facts come out here. 
The same thing should be done with respect to Judge Starr. When people say he hasn't produced very much, his investigation has run amok, he is leaking, he can't defend himself. We don't know whether any of those things are true, and he is owed the same sense of justice that the President and anyone else accused is owed; namely, the opportunity to present the facts when the process provides that opportunity. 
In due time, Judge Starr will be able to present those facts. At that time, we will know precisely what he has. Until then, I think it is incumbent upon all responsible people in this process to treat the independent counsel as they would treat any other person involved in law enforcement or the judicial process, with the respect and the dignity that the office carries. 
While I appreciate the fact that defense lawyers will sometimes stoop to any tactic to get their client off, it demeans the Office of the Presidency in this case for his lawyers to use the same kind of tactics that the lowest kind of defense lawyers would use in defending a party who is probably guilty of a heinous crime when there is no other defense than to attack the victim's credibility or to attack the prosecutor. 
That demeans the Office of the Presidency. It is time for this administration to treat the prosecutor with the same respect that they are demanding to be treated. I think that those of us who believe in our rule of law and in the system of justice in this country need to stand up and speak out and make that point. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak to this matter this morning.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, millions of Americans, myself included, listened intently to what President Clinton had to say about Social Security in his State of the Union address. What we heard--or what we thought we heard--was a plan by the President to reserve any budget surplus that might emerge in the next few years to shore up Social Security for future generations. 
It was a plan that drew widespread praise from the public. But now it turns out that what we heard is not, according to White House spokesmen, what the President really meant. The Washington Post put it this way in a February 4 report: `the ringing simplicity of Clinton's call to `save Social Security first' gave way to a fog of bewildering budget-speak from the administration's top economic advisers.' 
Here is what OMB spokesman Larry Haas had to say: `People who think it [President Clinton's proposal] shores up Social Security were not listening closely.' Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin admitted that the Clinton budget does not include any mechanism that would transfer surpluses to the Social Security trust fund. 
Mr. President, why the intricate game of words? Is Social Security first or not? Let us take a look. 
Next year--the year covered by President Clinton's proposed budget--Social Security itself will run an estimated surplus of about $93 billion. Remember, the system is currently generating surpluses that are intended to build up until about the year 2016, when we will have to begin using them to pay retirement benefits to 75 million baby boomers. 
But the Clinton budget does not set aside this $93 billion Social Security surplus. The Clinton budget spends every penny of it on general operating expenses of the federal government. 
The practice of using the Social Security nest egg to mask overall government deficits dates back to President Lyndon Johnson. Colleagues from both sides of the aisle have condemned it for years. It is only because President Clinton employs this sleight of hand--counting the Social Security surplus in the unified federal budget--that he is able to show an overall surplus of $9 billion for next year. If Social Security's $93 billion surplus and the surpluses held in other federal trust funds were removed from the calculations, the Clinton budget would actually show a deficit of $95.7 billion. 
Even the relatively small surplus that is created by commingling all of the funds--that is, after mixing Social Security with the rest of the federal budget--is shrunken considerably from what it would have been if the President reserved the entire amount for Social Security, as he said he would. That is because he devotes the bulk of the resulting surplus to a host of new spending initiatives. 
Here are just some of the new programs that President Clinton is proposing: 
a new clean water initiative for about $37 million; 
two new farm programs for $14 million; 
$170 million for new mandatory empowerment zones and enterprise communities; 
a new program called the Community Empowerment Fund, which will cost about $400 million; 
a new $10 million Indian land consolidation pilot program; 
$47 million on a new community adjustment program to help areas adversely affected by trade agreements; 
at least eight new education programs totaling over $1.8 billion; 
a new Medicare buy-in program costing $1.5 billion over five years; 
$4.5 billion for five new child-care related programs; 
a new smoking cessation program for $87 million; and 
two new law-enforcement initiatives for $200 million. 
The cost of these new programs is estimated to be about $120 billion to $130 billion over the next five years, and that does not even count the myriad increases he proposes for other existing federal programs. In other words, some $120 billion to $130 billion of anticipated unified budget surpluses are not reserved for Social Security at all, but are used to create brand new programs. 
Granted, many of these proposals are appealing, and some address real needs in our communities. Granted, some of the spending for these new programs is designed to come from the proposed tobacco settlement. But if President Clinton is sincere in his desire to reserve 100 percent of the surplus for Social Security, how is it that there is so much money for so many new programs? Why is the tobacco money not used to boost the size of the surplus that could be devoted to Social Security? 
Given the programs I just mentioned a few moments ago, it is obvious that Social Security is not really first on President Clinton's list of anticipated uses of any unified budget surplus. It is not second or even third. It does not make the top 10 list. It is number 26 on the President's list, after all of these other new programs are created. Remember, too, that President Clinton is proposing to spend the entire $93 billion surplus that the Social Security system will itself generate--spend it on other things. 
So what did President Clinton really mean when he spoke of Social Security in his State of the Union? Here is what he said:  
I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century. 
His budget clearly spends the surplus, so what hidden meaning could there possibly be in his apparently very carefully crafted words? 
Treasury Secretary Rubin explained to the Budget Committee that the President was merely declaring his opposition to using surpluses, should they materialize, for any purpose other than paying down the national debt until Congress and the President have agreed on a long-term solution that ensures the solvency of the Social Security program. In other words, nothing may ever be set aside specifically for Social Security. 
Mr. President, I am confused, as I think most Americans are, about President Clinton's intentions with respect to Social Security. John Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, told The Washington Post that many of his members are also confused and mistakenly assume the surpluses will be used to pay future Social Security benefits. 
Crafting next year's budget, let alone tackling the coming problems in the Social Security system and the many other important problems facing this administration and the country, requires straight talk and straight answers. Either Social Security is first or it is not. Either we reserve any surplus for Social Security or we do not. Tell the truth, and the American people will support what needs to be done. 
Senior citizens deserve better than to be treated as a political football by this President.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and, of course, second the remarks just made by my colleague from Texas. 
Mr. President, with the Federal Government apparently on 
the verge of its first unified budget surplus in nearly 30 years, many people are beginning to ask what comes next, what should happen to the budget surplus if and when it materializes. Should we spend it? Should we begin to pay down the national debt? Should we provide hard-working American families with some meaningful and, I would say, long overdue tax relief? 
Before we try to answer those questions, I think it is worthwhile to recall how we got here. Remember, it was not that long ago--in fact, it was as recently as February of 1995--that President Clinton submitted a budget that would have locked in annual deficits in the range of $200 billion in the foreseeable future. A unanimous Senate rejected the Clinton budget on May 19, 1995, and from that point on the debate took a fundamental turn from whether to balance the Federal budget to how to balance it. 
During the last 3 years, we began to slow Federal spending growth. We have eliminated 307 mostly small Federal programs. But perhaps the most decisive factor has been what we did not do. We did not impose another large tax increase on already overtaxed families and businesses. And that gave people enough room to do the things that they would naturally do to result in an invigoration of our economy. In fact, the economy has outperformed everyone's expectations, producing tens of billions of dollars in unanticipated revenues to the Treasury which has helped to close this budget gap. 
When the budget agreement passed last year, for example, deficits were projected to go from $67 billion to $90 billion. The budget agreement allowed for substantial amounts of new spending before starting down the path to balance in the year 2002. It was the expectation of deficits in the interim that were higher, not lower, that contributed to my decision to oppose last year's budget deal. It now turns out that the 1997 budget deficit came in at only $22 billion and is projected to amount to about $5 billion in the current year, all because of the economy's robust performance and it comes in spite, I would note, of the substantially increased spending allowed by the 1997 budget. 
So what ultimately we decide to do with the surplus--and again I caution that projections are just that, projections--we ought to be sure that it sustains the economic growth that has gotten us to where we are today. And that is why of the three possible approaches to utilizing this budget surplus, it seems to me the one that makes the most sense is to return what we do not need to spend at the Federal Government level back to the hard-working families who earned it so that they can make the decisions in their own lives as to how to spend that surplus, thereby enabling us to continue the long term of economic growth which this country has been on now for the last many months and to ensure that robust economic growth continues to produce more revenues to the Treasury in the future that can help us sustain both the Federal budget and ensure that we do not have deficits in the future. 
The President, of course, has taken a political road here. He is suggesting that we should use the surplus for Social Security purposes. As Senator Gramm pointed out, there is no indication as to how he would do that, and as a matter of fact since the money going into the Social Security trust fund amounts to an IOU to the Social Security trust fund because it is then immediately spent by the Federal Government, we do not put Social Security money in a shoe box here at the Federal 
Government level. What the President in fact is saying is simply allow that money to be spent by the general fund of the U.S. Government, and I think that is unacceptable. 
The other thing the President has said is, let's spend about $130 billion on new programs. That is not what to do with the budget surplus that may or may not materialize, and that in any event would put us on a road to spending that money every year in the future. Clearly, we cannot sustain forever the kind of economic growth we have today, and as a result we should not be embarking on new spending programs that we are going to have to find new sources of revenue to support in the future. 
Another thing we can do is to begin to pay down the national debt. Given the fact we are paying almost $1 billion a day on interest on the national debt, it makes sense for us to do that. So to the extent we do not need the revenues for other purposes, we can devote part of that to paying down the national debt. But I suggest that the best way to ensure that we can continue to have a robust economy, continue to gain the receipts that we need to pay for Federal Government programs and also to ensure that American families continue to receive some benefit from this economy is to provide that hard-working American family with tax relief to the extent that the budget surplus permits us to do so. 
Clearly, the most effective from an economic point of view, what Alan Greenspan testified to the other day, if we are going to provide tax relief, it should be in terms of marginal relief for all Americans. But to the extent that politically we are not able to do that this year and that we need to do something in a targeted fashion, I think most of us agree the most beneficial kind of tax relief would be aimed at eliminating the current marriage penalty which in effect has the Government of the United States supporting a policy which encourages people who are living together, working but who are not married, to continue to stay unmarried because, after all, if they marry, then the second person's income is immediately put into the top bracket and they end up paying a lot more in taxes than they would if they remained unmarried. It should not be Government policy to be fostering that kind of family situation, and as a result the marriage penalty ought to be one of our first targets for elimination to the extent we can spend any of this surplus for tax relief. 
I use the word `spend,' Mr. President, and in closing I want to make this point. That is the term that the budgeteers use, that the people inside the beltway use when they talk about a surplus and putting it to `good use.' They talk about spending as if it were Federal Government money. And in the beneficence of the Federal Government we are going to give it back to the American people. The truth of the matter is we should not have taken it from the American people in the first place because, as it turns out, we did not need it and as a result the only right thing to do is for the Federal Government to return it to the American people in the form of tax relief. 
Again, I conclude by saying the benefits of that are twofold and significant. No. 1, American families are already way overtaxed, and this enables them to provide more for their families in a way that they deem most effective rather than somebody here in Washington, DC. But secondly, because there is more family income at their disposal, to be spent, to be saved, and in saving to be invested in the American economy, we can ensure that the economy continues to perform as it has with the 
result that not only do we all have a better standard of living but, of course, the Federal Government continues to get more revenues because we have not changed basic tax rates. As long as those rates remain where they are, a robust economy is going to continue to allow the Federal Government to do just fine in terms of its collections of revenue. That is why we can ensure that we can balance budgets in the future, we can have plenty of money to begin paying down that Federal debt, and we can provide tax relief to families and encourage a robust economy if we will use whatever surplus exists to return to the American people so that they can then spend it as they see fit. 
These are the options. I think that the Republican plan, which focuses on debt reduction and tax relief, is the right way to go and that the President's ideas for more spending, while they will get a courteous listen here on Capitol Hill, are in the end not the best way to deal with the surplus that we might have and ultimately will have to be rejected by the Congress. 
I thank my colleague from Georgia for making this time available to discuss these important issues and look forward to our continuing discussions.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to provide a brief update for my colleagues this morning on the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom To Contract Act. 
This is the bill which has 46 cosponsors in the Senate, 150-some cosponsors in the House, led by the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, Bill Archer, to restore the freedom to America's senior citizens to seek the medical care they desire rather than to be dictated to by the Medicare Program to only receive that care under Medicare that they may desire. 
Here is the situation as it evolved. Mr. President, up until January 1st of this year, senior citizens in this country had always had the right under Medicare to go to the doctor of their choice, and if they wanted to be treated outside of Medicare they could do that. Of course, Medicare couldn't pay the bill. But that freedom always existed. As of a couple of years ago, the administration began to threaten physicians saying that they had to submit all bills for senior citizens to Medicare. The rationale was that anybody over 65 was `Medicare eligible' because they were 65, and if they were `Medicare eligible' then a doctor had to submit the bill to Medicare. So physicians began being concerned that they couldn't treat people outside of Medicare even though that had always been the patient's right and the physician's right. 
To ensure that situation wouldn't continue, I introduced an amendment last year during the negotiations--during the time we were negotiating the balanced budget amendment--and it passed here under a vote of 64 to 35 to ensure that patients had the right to `privately contract,' as it is called, and go to the doctor of their choice; not necessarily to go to Medicare, if they didn't want to. That amendment passed. It became part of the Medicare portion of the balanced budget amendment. But in the middle of the night some negotiators from the House and Senate caved in to the President's demands that if the Kyl amendment stayed in then the entire balanced budget amendment would be vetoed and, therefore, caved into his demands that a special limitation be placed on any physician providing this care; namely, that the physician had to get rid of all of his or her Medicare patients for a 2-year period in advance or you couldn't treat the person outside of Medicare. That is what went into effect January 1st. 
This legislation that I just reported on will remove that 2-year requirement so that the patient has the freedom to go to the doctor of his or her choice. Even though you are over 65 years old, you don't have to be treated under the Medicare system if you do not want to be, and the physician has the right to take care of you without getting rid of his or her other Medicare patients. 
When did this situation arise? There are a lot of different situations. Take for example the psychiatric patient who doesn't want the records in Medicare to reveal the kind of treatment that patient has been receiving. Under the current administration plan--Medicare or no care--you either do it under Medicare or you don't get the treatment. No doctor can take care of you. Our bill would say no. You can go outside of Medicare and be treated. Again, you have to pay the bill--not the taxpayer. But you can do it. 
Another case: You are in a small town. There are not that many specialists. You need specialty care. You go to a doctor who says, `I am not taking any more Medicare patients. The President and the Congress have cut our payments so much that it don't pay me anymore. In fact, I lose money on every one. I will take care of the ones that I have, but I am not going to see any more new Medicare patients.' This enables the patient to say, `Fine. Just bill me. I will pay you. We will save Medicare the money.' And that will be the end of it. 
Another situation: You want to go to that specialist. Maybe it is a person who is on a university faculty who is not taking Medicare patients, and you want to be treated by that person because it is the one person that can save your life or your spouse's life. You ought to have the right to do that in this country. Under the current law that wouldn't be possible. 
So our legislation restores the right of senior citizens--and all the rest of us have this right--to go to the doctor of their choice, and if they want to be treated outside of the Medicare system have the right to do that. It does not enable the doctor to charge more money to Medicare. Whatever the doctor charges they have to pay outside of the Medicare Program. 
So this is not going to be used very often, I suspect. But in those situations where people really want to take advantage of their freedom in contract they ought to have the right to so. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, this is not something that is just of concern for America's senior citizens, because all of us should be concerned about a fundamental right being taken away from us--the right to provide the health care that we want for ourselves or our families. 
As the President is talking about making Medicare available to more and more people at younger and younger ages, I would have to ask them: Is it such a good deal to buy into Medicare when the first thing that happens when you do that is you give up a basic right that you have today--that every one of us has today--but doesn't exist for somebody who is 65 years old or older because they are Medicare eligible? It is not a good bargain. 
So what I am hoping is that the Finance Committee will hold hearings later this month--those hearings have already been set, I understand, by Senator Roth--and that there will be legislation coming to the floor, and our bill coming to the Senate floor very soon thereafter. And sometime in the early spring we can pass on to the President a bill which will restore the right of all seniors in this country to go to the doctor of their choice without being told by Medicare that they can't do that; that, in effect, it is either Medicare or no care. That is un-American. It is wrong. It denies the basic right of all Americans. And we need to ensure that we can correct that problem through the passage of the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom Contract Act. 
In closing, if any one of my colleagues who have not done so already would like to sponsor the legislation, please see me because we will be moving forward on this very quickly. 
Thank you.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there are a lot of things wrong with our nation's Tax Code, but two things in the code that have always struck me as particularly egregious are the steep taxes imposed on people when they get married and when they die. While it will probably take some time to build the kind of public consensus that will be necessary to overhaul the Tax Code in its entirety, there is broad public support for us to do something in the short term about these taxes--the notorious marriage penalty and the death tax--and in the process take two meaningful steps closer to a tax system that is simpler and more fair. 
Mr. President, what rationale can there possibly be for imposing a marriage penalty? All of us say we are concerned that families do not have enough to make ends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for child care, college, or to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a system that overtaxes families. According to Tax Foundation estimates, the average American family pays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes to federal, state, and local governments. To put it another way, in families where both parents work, one of the parents is nearly working full time just to pay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, then, that parents do not have enough to make ends meet when government is taking that much. It is just not right. 
The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an extra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, and the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner families making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight percent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest percentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 and $30,000 per year. 
Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their pockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they choose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one parent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what they decide is best for them. They could make four to five payments on their car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine months. 
A constituent of mine from Tucson, Arizona put it this way: `We need your help as young married middle class Americans to plan our family's future. We need help to plan our retirement, our children's education, our dignity. Please help get rid of the marriage tax.' 
Mr. President, this constituent is simply asking that a young family be able to keep more of what it earns. Taxing marriage is wrong. It is bad social policy and bad economic policy. We ought to do away with it this year. And with that in mind, I have joined Senators Faircloth and Hutchison and 35 of our colleagues who have cosponsored S. 1285, the Marriage Tax Elimination Act. A similar bill on the House side, H.R. 2456, has 233 cosponsors. Given the broad support the initiative enjoys in both chambers--and around the country--I think we stand a good chance of getting this done this year. We should. 
The death tax is just as wrong, and we ought to do something about it, too. It is wrong to make grieving families face the funeral director and the tax collector in the same week. And it is wrong to break up family-owned businesses just to extract an additional tax from someone one last time before he or she is laid to rest. 
The death tax imposes a heavy toll on families, as well as the communities in which they live. Maybe that is why 15 states have repealed their state death taxes since 1980. 
Mr. President, in its January 12 edition, the Wall Street Journal carried a story about the impending sale of America's largest African-American newspaper chain, Sengstacke Enterprises, Inc. The chain's pioneering leader, James Sengstacke, passed away last May, and the chain is now faced with the daunting task of raising enough cash to pay the estate tax--something that is more commonly known as the death tax. 
I do not know the Sengstacke family, but their story is compelling, and I hope our colleagues will listen closely as I read a few lines from the Journal's report. The article begins by noting that the newspaper chain is comprised of the daily Chicago Defender and three weeklies--the New Pittsburgh Courier, the Tri-State Defender, and the Michigan Chronicle. And then it goes on with the extraordinary story of the family business:  
Founded by Robert Sengstacke Abbott in 1905, the Chicago Defender helped ignite the Great Migration--the move of tens of thousands of Southern black sharecroppers northward to Chicago and other cities. When Mr. Abbott's nephew, John Sengstacke, took over in 1940, the Defender grew from a weekly to a daily, printing stories that challenged discrimination on nearly every front, from the U.S. Army to the baseball field. 
Mr. Sengstacke was instrumental in persuading Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey to hire baseball's first black player, Jackie Robinson. For several decades, the Defender was viewed as the most important training ground for aspiring black journalists. 
Mr. President, the tragedy is that the death tax may force the Sengstacke family to part 
with this treasured piece of their heritage--a family-owned company that has, among other things, worked hard to try to stamp out the scourge of discrimination around the country. Contemplating the thought of the chain being taken over by outsiders, the founder's grandniece, Myiti Sengstacke, said, `No one--black or white--is going to understand and cherish the vision my uncle had for starting the company other than someone in his family.' 
Other families around the country have similar stories to tell. Here is what a good friend and constituent of mine wrote in a letter to me last year: 
Since my father died, our lives have been a nightmare of lawyers and trust companies with the common theme, `you have to protect the family business.' It was hard enough trying to recuperate after my father's long illness, and then adjusting to the reality he was gone. 
This family in Arizona built up a printing business from just one employee 39 years ago to over 200 employees today. The founder--the family patriarch--was one of the most generous people I have ever met. He gave to just about every charitable cause in our community, and he made our community a much better place in the process. 
Mr. President, hard work and thrift, creating jobs, and contributing to the community are among the last things we ought to penalize. And so I sponsored the Family Heritage Preservation Act, S. 75, to repeal the cruel death tax. Twenty-nine of our colleagues have joined me as cosponsors of that measure, and the companion House bill, which was introduced by Congressman Chris Cox, has 166 cosponsors. A recent poll commissioned by the seniors group, 60 Plus, found that fully 77 percent of Americans are supportive of death-tax repeal. 
We took some important steps in the direction of death-tax relief last year when we approved a phased increase in the unified credit and new protections for a limited number of family-owned businesses. Unfortunately, the `family-business carve-out' made what is arguably the most complex portion of the Tax Code even more complicated. Here is what representatives of small businesses told the House Ways and Means Committee on January 28. 
The National Federation of Independent Business told the committee that even though the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act gave small-business owners some relief from the unfair death tax, small-business owners should not be paying this tax at all. Jack Faris, the President of NFIB, said that the organization continues to fight for complete elimination of this onerous tax. 
The Small Business Council of America described last year's changes this way. `The new Qualified Family-Owned Business Interest Exclusion is now the most complex provision in the Tax Code. At best, it will help less than five percent of family businesses facing sale or liquidation from the death tax.' 
These sentiments are consistent with the message we heard from delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business, who placed death-tax repeal fourth among their 60 recommendations to Congress and the President. And with good reason. The death tax is gradually destroying family enterprise, first by slowing business growth, then by forcing companies to restructure through mergers or sales. 
According to the Heritage Foundation, repeal of the death tax would free capital resources for more productive investment, leading to an average of $11 billion per year in extra output, an average of 145,000 additional jobs created, and personal income rising an average of $8 billion per year above current projections. So not only would death-tax repeal be good for families, it would help the economy as well. 
Mr. President, repealing the marriage penalty and the death tax should be among our top priorities this year. Together, these two steps will get us closer to the kind of Tax Code we all say we want--one that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Let us do this for America's families.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there has not been much conversation about one of the judicial nominees pending before us. I did want to make a few comments on his behalf. The reason for the lack of comments is that I believe he has the unanimous, bipartisan support of everyone here in the body. And I appreciate that because I, too, enthusiastically endorse the nomination of U.S. Magistrate Judge Barry Silverman of the State of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and I would like to make a few comments on his behalf at this point. 
Judge Silverman brings a proven judicial track record to this position. For the past 2 1/2 years he has served as a magistrate judge on the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, my home State. For over 10 years prior to that, he was a superior court judge in Maricopa County. While on the superior court bench, he rendered superior service in all aspects of his civil, criminal, juvenile and domestic relations assignments. 
In addition to his time on the bench, Judge Silverman spent 5 years as court commissioner for the Superior Court of Arizona, Maricopa County. 
Throughout his distinguished judicial career, Judge Silverman has earned the respect and admiration of fellow judges and the advocates who have appeared in his courtroom. For example, in 1991, Judge Silverman received the Henry Stevens Award, which is given annually by the Maricopa County Bar Association to the current or former Arizona trial judge `who reflects the finest qualities of the judiciary.' 
Similarly, in 1994, the Maricopa County Committee on Judicial Performance indicated that Judge Silverman received the highest percentage of superior ratings from lawyers, litigants, witnesses, and court staff in all categories of performance reviewed. 
Also, in 1994, Judge Silverman's court division was honored as the judicial division of the year by the Maricopa County Superior Court Recognition Committee. 
Incidentally, I should say that Maricopa County is the county in which Phoenix is located, the capital of our State. 
In addition to his regular judicial duties, Judge Silverman has advanced the legal profession through service on the Supreme Court of Arizona Judicial Ethics and Advisory Committee, the Committee on Judicial Education and Training, and the Committee on Professionalism. He also chaired a Committee to Study the Criminal Justice System in the Arizona Superior Court in 1993, and the Governor's Committee on Child Support Guidelines. 
Judge Silverman has shown his commitment to the United States Constitution and the rule of law by cofounding the Sandra Day O'Connor Prize for Excellence in Constitutional Law at the Arizona State University College of Law. 
Judge Silverman's academic credentials are equally impressive. He graduated summa cum laude from the Arizona State University College of Law in 1976 and was subsequently honored by his alma mater twice, once in 1994, when the college of law presented him with its `Outstanding Alumnus Award,' and again in 1997 when he received the prestigious `Dean's Award.' 
In short, Mr. President, I believe Judge Silverman meets the highest of standards required for our Federal judges, and I have been very privileged to support his nomination as it has proceeded through the process and come to the floor of the Senate. I urge all of my colleagues to support the nomination of Judge Barry Silverman for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Allow me to conclude, Mr. President, with this observation. It has been a pleasure to work with the White House on this nomination. From the time that his name came forward, they worked diligently to conclude the FBI process, which does take some time. We received from the White House the Sunday before Congress adjourned in November the file for Judge Silverman and the committee was able to get that file in 1 day, the following Monday. 
Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who has been criticized for holding up some nominees, I must say, deserves a great deal of credit here for personally conducting the hearing for Judge Silverman. And then the following day--this is now 3 days after we received the file--scheduling an executive session of the committee so that we could send his nomination to the full Senate floor. 
Chairman Hatch and I then requested the majority leader on the last day of the session in November to clear this nomination so that the ninth circuit could receive him and have his services. Unfortunately, the democratic leader was not able to clear Judge Silverman on the democratic side and therefore about 2 1/2 months, unnecessarily, the ninth circuit was without a judge in this particular position. But I am particularly pleased that he is before us today and that we will very soon have an opportunity to vote and to confirm Judge Silverman for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am proud to support H.R. 2265, the No Electronic Theft [NET] Act which is the companion bill to S. 1044, the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997, introduced by Senator Leahy and myself. 
H.R. 2265 passed the House of Representatives earlier this week and now has the opportunity to obtain Senate approval and be sent to the President before we adjourn for the session. The bill is supported by the Department of Justice, the U.S. Copyright Office, and the Software Publishers Association, which is the leading trade association of the computer software industry, representing over 1,200 companies that develop and market software for entertainment, business, education, and the Internet. 
H.R. 2265 will help combat software piracy by closing a major loophole in federal law, which was highlighted by the case of United States v. LaMacchia, 871 F.Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994). Under current law, a showing of financial gain is required to prove criminal copyright infringement. In LaMacchia, the defendant maliciously pirated software which resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 million in just over 6 weeks. Because LaMacchia did not profit from the software piracy, he could not be prosecuted under criminal copyright law. 
Because much software piracy on the Internet apparently occurs without the exchange of money, the so-called `LaMacchia loophole' discourages law enforcement from taking action against willful, commercial-scale software pirates out to gain notoriety, not money. 
In sum, this bill extends criminal infringement of copyright to include any person--not just those who act for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain--who willfully infringe a copyright. Specifically, the bill: (1) expands the definition of `financial gain' to include the expectation of receipt of anything of value--including the receipt of other copyrighted works; (2) sets penalties for willfully infringing a copyright by reproducing or distributing (including electronically), during any 180-day period, one or more copies of one or more copyrighted works with a total retail value of more than $1,000; (3) extends the statute of limitations for criminal copyright infringement from three to five years; (4) punishes recidivists more severely; (5) extends victims' rights with regard to criminal copyright infringement; and (6) directs the Sentencing Commission to determine sufficiently stringent guidelines to deter these types of crimes. 
H.R. 2265 is needed to help protect the interests of the entire software industry by protecting against the unauthorized copying and distribution of computer programs. In 1996, piracy cost the software industry over $2 billion in the United States and over $11 billion around the world. 
Mr. President, the United States is the world's leader in intellectual property. We export billions of dollars of copyrighted works every year. Our creative community is a bulwark of our national economy. By addressing the flaw in our copyright law that LaMacchia has brought to light, H.R. 2265 sends the strong message that we value the contributions of writers, artists, and other creators, and will not tolerate the theft of their intellectual endeavors. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act of 1997. It is long past time to punish criminals who have perpetrated fraudulent telephone scams. 
Telemarketing fraud swindles Americans out of $40 billion dollars every year, but one group in particular is especially hard hit: senior citizens. In fact, the Attorney General recently noted that the elderly are subject to a barrage of high-pressure sales calls, sometimes as many as five or more calls every day.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am gratified that S. 493, the Cellular Telephone Protection Act, which would make it easier for Federal law enforcement to stop cell phone cloning, has unanimously been approved by the Senate. I expect that the bill will soon pass the House of Representatives, and be signed into law by the President. S. 493 is the first in a series of anticrime initiatives I introduced that are aimed at modernizing U.S. law to reflect changes in technology. 
It is estimated that the cellular telecommunications industry lost $650 million due to fraud in 1995, much of it as a result of cloning. Cloned phones are popular among the most vicious criminal element. The feature story from the July/August edition of Time Digital, `Lethal Weapon: How Your Cell Phone Became Gangland's Favorite Gadget' quotes James Kallstrom, head of the FBI's New York office as describing cloners as `hard-core criminals, child pornographers and pedophiles * * * violent criminals who use technology to avoid the law.' 
On September 11, Representative Bill McCollum, chairman of the House Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, held a very useful hearing on cellular phone cloning. The hearing discussed legislative proposals to combat cellular phone fraud. Representatives of the Secret Service, FBI, and DEA all testified that legislation resembling S. 493 would be helpful in thwarting cell phone cloning. 
The hearing revealed that cloned phones have become a staple of the major drug trafficking organizations. Anthony R. Bocchichio, of the DEA stated that, `[International drug trafficking organizations] utilize their virtually unlimited wealth to purchase the most sophisticated electronic equipment available on the market to facilitate their illegal activities. We have begun to see that this includes widespread use of cloned cellular telephones.' 
The Secret Service--the Federal agency charged with investigating cloning offenses--has doubled the number of arrests in the area of wireless telecommunications fraud every year since 1991, with 800 individuals charged for their part in the cloning of cellular phones last year. While the cell phone law (18 U.S.C. 1029) has been useful in prosecuting some cloners, the statute has not functioned well in stopping those who manufacture and distribute cloning devices. 
In testimony before Mr. McCollum's Crime Subcommittee, Michael C. Stenger of the U.S. Secret Service stressed the need to revise our current cell phone statute:  
Due to the fact that the statute presently requires the proof of `intent to defraud' to charge the violation, the distributors of the cloning equipment have become elusive targets. These distributors utilize disclaimers in their advertising mechanisms aimed at avoiding a finding of fraudulent intent. This allows for the continued distribution of the equipment permitting all elements of the criminal arena to equip themselves with free, anonymous phone service. 
Consistent with Mr. Stenger's recommendation, the Cellular Telephone Protection Act provides that--except for law enforcement and telecommunications carriers--there is no lawful purpose for which to possess, produce, or sell the `copycat boxes' for cloning a wireless telephone or its electronic serial number. 
For S. 493 to apply, a prosecutor would need to prove that an individual `knowingly uses, produces, traffics in, has control or custody of, or possesses hardware or software, knowing it has been configured for altering or modifying a telecommunications instrument so that such instrument may be used to obtain unauthorized access to telecommunications services.' Someone who does not know that a telecommunications device has been altered to modify a telecommunications instrument would not be criminally liable under this section. 
To be clear, except for law enforcement and telecommunication carriers, there is no legitimate purpose for which to possess equipment used to modify cellular phones. Representatives from the Secret Service, DEA, and FBI testified to this point at the cellular fraud hearing. As Special Agent Stenger put it, `There is no legitimate use for the equipment such as that designed to alter the electronic serial numbers in wireless telephones.' 
The removal of the `intent to defraud' language in 18 U.S.C. 1029 only applies to the possession and use of the hardware and software configured to alter telecommunications instruments. This narrowly targeted proposal does not apply to those who are in the possession of cloned phones. Nor does it apply to those in the possession of scanning receivers, which do have some legitimate uses. 
The Senate bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. Senators Cleland, DeWine, Dorgan, Durbin, Gorton, Helms, Lott, Mikulski, and Thurmond have cosponsored S. 493. And a bipartisan House companion bill (H.R. 2460) has been introduced by Representatives Sam Johnson, Bill McCollum, and Charles Schumer. 
I am hopeful that my colleagues will join in supporting this important piece of legislation.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to give a report to my colleagues on the status of the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom To Contract Act, the so-called Medicare private contracting issue, which has been before both the Senate and House for several weeks now following the adoption of the Balanced Budget Act, which contained in it a provision which makes it much more difficult for physicians to serve patients who want to contract outside of Medicare. 
Let me briefly tell you what the problem is, the legislative status, and the resolution--at least as of now--that we have been able to accomplish. 
The issue is whether or not physicians can serve both Medicare patients and people under private contracts who are 65 years of age. Once a person turns 65, of course, they are eligible for Medicare, and most of the services they can obtain are paid for by Medicare. But occasionally, either there is a service that is not covered by Medicare, or even sometimes services that are covered by Medicare that a patient would prefer to obtain from a physician outside of the Medicare Program. 
For example, a constituent of mine had a condition that required the aid of a specialist in her small community. There were none available, except one person who was no longer taking Medicare patients. By the way, Mr. President, this is a common situation, because Medicare, especially for specialists, does not reimburse even up to their level of costs. So while many physicians don't want to dump their existing Medicare patient load and they want to continue to serve those patients they have been serving for a long time, they are not anxious to take on new Medicare patients. In this case, she went to the physician. He said he would be happy to take care of her, but he wasn't taking anymore Medicare patients. 
Her response was, `Well, I will just pay you directly. You bill me, and I will pay you. That way Medicare will save some money, and I will get the treatment I need, and you won't have to take new Medicare patients.' He found that the Federal Government would have deemed that to be a violation of law and, therefore, he would have been precluded from providing the services. 
It was in response to that kind of a problem that we created a piece of legislation that would allow patients who are 65 years of age to have the right to go to the physician of their choice and to be treated outside of the Medicare Program, if that is their choice. We passed that legislation here in the Senate. It became part of the Balanced Budget Act. And, before the act was finalized, the President indicated his desire to veto that legislation if that provision were retained. As a result, some changes were made, the most important of which was to add a provision to the act which makes it virtually impossible for patients to actually have the benefit of that freedom of choice. The provision was that a physician providing such services had to opt out of all Medicare treatment 2 years in advance. 
In other words, patients still had the right to go to a physician. But any physician that provided those services could not provide any Medicare services for a period of 2 years. That meant that it was virtually impossible then for physicians to serve these particular patients. 
In an effort to try to resolve that, we introduced the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom of Contract Act. It has almost 50 cosponsors in the Senate, well over 100 cosponsors in the House version sponsored by the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer. We hoped that we would have the opportunity to get that passed before the end of this legislative session this year. It was not to be. People in the House of Representatives did not feel that they wanted to go forward with it under the constraints of time. There were some other issues. As a result, we did not push it as an amendment to one of the appropriations bills or other vehicles by which we could have done that here in the Senate. 
Instead, I sought to proceed in a way that would enable us to ensure that we would make progress early next year on getting this issue resolved. Yesterday, I met with the President's nominee to head HCFA, Nancy-Ann Minn Deparle. She gave me a series of assurances of ways that they want to continue to work on this problem. I also received a phone call from Secretary Shalala providing the same assurances that we will be able to sit down and work with the administration to try to resolve this issue so that early next year we will be able to pass legislation that will solve this problem of Medicare-private contracting. 
In addition to that, I received some assurances from Nancy-Ann Minn Deparle that the law that goes into effect on January 1 would not affect the provision of services not covered by Medicare. It would not affect the provision of service only partially covered by Medicare--on Medicare, for example, a second mammography beyond the annual mammography covered by Medicare. It would not affect the provision of care under the Medicare Plus Choice Plan, the Medical Savings Account option, and it would not affect the ability of other physicians in a group practice to treat Medicare beneficiaries when a patient makes a private contract with one of the group practitioners. 
We worked on some of the other problems relating to this in addition to try to develop legislation next year that will be approved by the House and Senate and the administration. I will report more on the progress of this after a while. 
I would like to introduce into the Record two items that came to my attention this morning. One, a copy of three letters that were published.

Mr. KYL. 
Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Iran Missile Protection Act of 1997, the so-called, IMPACT 97 legislation, a similar version of which Curt Weldon introduced in the House of Representatives last week. 
The IMPACT 97 legislation is aptly named because it is intended to have a real impact on the growing threat from Iranian ballistic missiles. Recent revelations that Iran has nearly completed development of two new ballistic missiles--made possible with Russian assistance--that will allow it to strike targets as far away as Central Europe has convinced me that United States theater missile defenses must be accelerated in order to counter the emerging Iranian threat. 
According to published reports, a long-range Iranian missile, Shahab 4, could be fielded in as little as 3 years. A shorter range missile, Shahab 3, which will be capable of reaching Israel, could be operational in 12 to 18 months. Both missiles could be armed with chemical or biological warheads. These reports are the latest in a string of increasingly troubling disclosures that have surfaced since the Los Angeles Times first reported in February that Russia was providing missile technology and assistance to Iran. 
A bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives have been working on various legislative approaches to address the Iranian threat. For example, Representative Jane Harman and I introduced a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the administration should impose sanctions against Russian entities transferring ballistic missile technology to Iran. The annual foreign aid bill, currently in conference, contains a provision strictly conditioning the release of aid to Russia on certification by the President that Moscow has stopped the transfer of nuclear and missile technology to Iran. And, Senator Lott and Representative Gilman have also introduced legislation that would require that sanctions be imposed against any entity caught transferring goods to support Iran's ballistic missile program. 
In addition to the legislative approach, the administration has been engaged in a series of diplomatic exchanges with the Russians. According to press accounts, Vice President Gore has raised the issue with Prime Minister Chernomyrdin during their meetings in February and July. President Clinton has raised the matter with President Yeltsin at the Helsinki summit in March and the P-8 summit in June. The administration has also appointed Ambassador Frank Wisner as its special envoy to discuss with Russian officials the allegations made regarding transfers of technology to Iran. This is a very serious issue which the Clinton administration has clearly acknowledged. 
While we hope that the diplomatic efforts will bear fruit, it is entirely possible that it will not. In that event, the United States and our allies must be prepared to defend and protect ourselves from the possibility that Iran will use ballistic missiles armed with chemical, biological, or nuclear warheads. It is that possibility--some might say eventuality--that IMPACT 97 is intended to address. 
Neither the United States nor Israel will have missile defenses capable of countering the threat from the Shahab 3 or Shahab 4 missile before those systems are deployed. IMPACT 97 authorizes the accelerated development of some key theater defense systems, as well as the procurement of additional batteries of interceptors capable of providing protection against the Iranian missiles. 
Specifically, IMPACT 97 would authorize an additional: $65 million to accelerate development of Navy Upper Tier; $100 million to purchase a second THAAD UOES system; $15 million to improve interoperability of the THAAD radar with other missile defense systems; 110 million to purchase additional Arrow Missiles and for production enhancement to accelerate deployment; $15 million to accelerate development of a remote launch capability for PAC-3 using a THAAD radar to enlarge the area the system can defend; $25 million for PAC-3 production enhancements to accelerate deployment of the system; $35 million to purchase two Cobra Gemini radars to improve missile tracking; and $20 million for development of the Joint Composite Tracking Network to improve command and control and interoperability of missile defense systems. 
I believe that the potential threat from these Iranian ballistic missiles is so grave that we cannot afford to wait until they are deployed to respond with defenses. I have personally discussed this legislation with members of the Department of Defense, and my staff has been in regular contact with other officials there to help ensure that the best bill possible is presented for consideration. In the end, the Department has decided not to support this legislation, however, I have reasonable confidence that the programs identified, and the funding provided, is an accurate reflection of where BMDO would spend the additional funds, if provided. Secretary Cohen has indicated in a letter to me that he does not recommend that additional resources be applied to the theater missile defense programs. Unfortunately, the current deployment schedule for the TMD programs is inadequate, and I have to respectfully disagree with Secretary Cohen about his assessment that the programs are progressing as fast as they can. This legislation will ensure that the United States and its allies can counter the growing threat from Iran's ballistic missile program. 
I hope that the Armed Services Committee will be able to act on this legislation promptly and that the full Senate can debate IMPACT 97 early next year.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, a series of increasingly troubling reports have been published in the press indicating Iran has nearly completed development of two long-range missiles that will allow it to strike targets as far away as central Europe. According to these press reports, Russian missile assistance has been the critical factor that has enabled Tehran's missile program to make such rapid progress. 
In order to halt this dangerous trade, Representative Harman and I have introduced a bipartisan concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that proliferation of such technology and missile components by Russian governmental and nongovernmental entities must stop. Our resolution calls on the President to use all the tools at his disposal, including targeted sanctions, to end this proliferation threat, if these activities do not cease. 
I join with Representative Harman, in clarifying that this resolution is not intended to affect the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program or similar U.S. government projects and programs which seek to reduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, their materials, know-how, as well as associated means of delivery currently being conducted. But we need to be clear that those individuals who proliferate will be penalized with the tools the U.S. has available.

Mr. KYL. I appreciate that. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Wyoming taking this time to discuss what we think is one of the most important matters yet to be decided before the end of this legislative session. I know we have some appropriations bills to pass to ensure that the Federal Government is funded for next year, and perhaps a couple of other items, like the fast-track legislation. But in terms of important principles, I can't think of anything more important than ensuring that the American people have the right to go to the doctor of their choice. 
You heard me right. I said to ensure that the American people have the right to go to the doctor of their choice. You mean they don't have that right? Well, Mr. President, unless we fix a part of the balanced budget bill that we passed earlier in this session, as of January 1, senior citizens in this country will not be guaranteed the right to go to the physician of their choice. Here is the problem. 
The Clinton administration interprets the Medicare law to require that a Medicare patient be treated under Medicare; that that person cannot go to a doctor who may see some Medicare patients but is not taking anymore Medicare patients and, therefore, is unwilling to treat the patient as a Medicare patient. Here is the exact situation, a real-life story that happened to one of my constituents in the small town of Prescott, AZ. 
She just turned 65. She is diabetic. She was having complications. She wanted to see a physician who could take care of her, and there weren't very many specialists in that small town. She found one who could take care of her. She went to him and he said, `Now, you are 65.' 
She said, `Yes.' 
He said, `Then I don't think I can take care of you.' 
She said, `Why not?" 
He said, `I'm not taking anymore Medicare patients, you're Medicare eligible.' 
She said, `That is all right, send me the bill, I will pay you. We will save Medicare money.' 
He checked with HCFA, the entity that runs Medicare, and sure enough, he could be prosecuted for a Federal crime if he entered into what is called a private contract with her. 
That is the way the Clinton administration interprets the law and, in fact, Mr. President, that is the way they want the law to read because they don't want any competition for Medicare. Once you turn 65, it is their view that everybody should have Medicare and only Medicare. One of my colleagues said it is Medicare or no care. 
That is an unacceptable choice for senior citizens in this country. Why should you become second class when you turn 65 and not be able to contract privately with a physician of your choice? 
I am on a Federal health care plan. I happen to like Blue Cross, so I signed up with the Blue Cross plan. But I still go to 
a doctor that is outside of that plan and pay for it myself. I have that right. Why shouldn't a senior citizen have the same right that I do under my Federal health care plan? Why should someone, merely because they turn 65, be denied the right to privately contract with the physician of their choice? Maybe they have been seeing the same doctor for 40 years and they want to continue seeing that doctor but he is not taking anymore Medicare patients, why shouldn't they be able to go to him and why shouldn't he be able to contract directly with them? 
We passed it 64-35 in the Senate. It went into the balanced budget bill, but the administration said, no, they would veto the balanced budget bill unless we took that provision out or unless we changed it. How did they insist it be changed, without my approval by the way? They said, OK, the patient can have the choice but no doctor can serve such a patient unless in advance he opts out of Medicare for 2 years. 
Let's be realistic, only 4 percent of the nonpediatricians don't serve any Medicare patients. Most doctors have some Medicare patients. Do we want to literally force those doctors to dump all of their Medicare patients just so they can privately contract? That is not the way to encourage more doctors to see more Medicare patients. Why shouldn't a physician be able to both treat patients under Medicare and not treat patients under Medicare? 
There is only one argument, other than the fact this presents some competition to Medicare. In that regard, I don't see how it hurts Medicare, because to the extent that anybody would choose not to take advantage of Medicare, they are saving Medicare money. It doesn't hurt Medicare. It actually helps Medicare, they don't have to pay as much. 
There is some concern that some unscrupulous doctor somewhere might take advantage of a Medicare patient. `I'm not going to treat you under Medicare; you have to enter into a private contract with me, and I am going to gouge you.' I don't think that is going to happen. 
Just to be sure, we built into the bill which I introduced a provision against fraud. It requires a written contract, and the patient can get out of it at any time. HCFA gets information from the doctor which tells them exactly what is going on. So if there is any fraud, that doctor can be prosecuted. So we have taken care of the major problem that has been raised. 
I don't think there is any reason why our bill should not pass. I don't think this Congress should go on record as standing for the principle that when you turn 65 in the United States of America, you don't have the choice to go to the doctor of your choice, and that doctor doesn't have the choice to care for you if he wants to do that. It is wrong, it is un-American, it is a violation of fundamental rights, and before this Congress adjourns, Mr. President, we need to fix the law so that senior citizens in this country have a fundamental right to the medical care that they deserve. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his sponsorship of this time for us to discuss this issue. I hope we have a chance before this legislative session is over to act upon this bill to get it passed and that the President will sign it. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate will be in for a period of morning business until 12:30 p.m. At 12:30 p.m., we hope the Senate will be receiving the continuing resolution from the House. If that is the case, then debate will begin immediately in the Senate. As always, Members will be notified when the vote on the continuing resolution is scheduled. 
In addition, the Senate may turn to any appropriations conference reports that may become available. As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed last evening on the ISTEA legislation. Therefore, all second-degree amendments must be filed prior to the vote on Thursday. All Senators will be notified as to when that cloture vote will occur on Thursday. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for several days now the Senate has debated campaign finance reform legislation. Advocates of the so-called McCain-Feingold proposal deserve credit for advancing the issue. Unfortunately, in the view of a majority, they have been unable to construct a bill that does not violate the first amendment to the Constitution. There are other proposals for reform that I believe can address the problems without compromising the Constitution. Therefore, I will vote to bring at least one of those proposals--the Paycheck Protection Act--to a vote but not yet support consideration of McCain-Feingold. 
Some have argued that details are less important than the general principle of reform. But reform to one is not necessarily reform to another. For example, most Republicans believe that all contributions to politics should be voluntary. Most Democrats, on the other hand, say they agree but they are unwilling to give up compulsory union dues that are then contributed to candidates. Thus, reform to us is not reform to them. 
Recognizing that we approach the need for reform from different perspectives, I have tried to evaluate the issue by applying some basic principles that I think most of us would agree with. For example, our laws should be clear, simple, and enforceable. They should insist on full and timely disclosure. They should place constituent interest over special interest. They should ensure voluntary participation for all. And, they should protect our right to free speech--unregulated by the government. This last principle is significant because our constitutional rights to free speech, free assembly, and the right to petition our Government were specifically established to protect our political expression. The Supreme Court has confirmed this, declaring that political expression is `at the core of our electoral process and of the first amendment freedoms.' (Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 44 (citing Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23 (1968))). 
The McCain-Feingold proposal incorporates some of these important principles. For example, the bill requires more timely and detailed disclosure of campaign spending. This allows people to make more informed decisions regarding contributions made to their elected leaders. The bill calls for tougher penalties for campaign violations. This might make people think twice about breaking the law. The bill attempts to tighten the restrictions on fundraising on federal property and strengthen the restriction on foreign money ban. Both of these provisions would address some of the Clinton-Gore campaign finance improprieties. The bill prohibits those under 18 from contributing to campaigns, ensuring that only those who vote can contribute, again addressing a problem with the Clinton-Gore campaign. The bill also extends the ban on mass mailing by House and Senate Members from 60 days before an election to January 1 of an election year, thereby reducing an incumbent advantage. 
I support the intent, if not the exact language, of each of these provisions. I also believe that any reform legislation should include a requirement that candidates raise a majority of their campaign contributions from within their respective States and that all political activities be funded with voluntary contributions and not extracted in the form of compulsory union dues. The first of these proposals is not included in the McCain-Feingold legislation, and I believe it is necessary to meet the principles of putting constituent interest over special interest. The second proposal is 
not adequately dealt with because of opposition from Senator McCain's Democratic cosponsor. 
The most extensive provisions of the McCain-Feingold proposal address so-called soft money and issue/express advocacy. While these provisions are well intentioned, I believe they would dramatically restrict party building activities and free speech for individuals, associations, and citizens. 
The McCain-Feingold approach to so-called soft money contributions is to completely prohibit them. These are contributions of citizens and organizations to political parties and cannot be spent for individual candidates. Hard money, on the other hand, is contributed directly to candidates to be spent by them. 
Unlike hard money, soft money can be contributed in unlimited amounts to support political party organizations by helping them to engage in grassroots volunteer activities. The bill's total ban on soft money contributions would restrict State and local campaign committees from supporting the following election activity: voter registration activity within 120 days before a Federal election; voter identification, get-out-the-vote activity, or general campaign activity conducted in connection with any election that includes a candidate for Federal offices--generally referred to as party building activity; and a communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for Federal office and that is made for the purpose of influencing a Federal election. Thus, if the law were to completely ban soft money, it is not the candidates, but the political parties that would suffer the most. Is this the type of political activity we really want to get rid of? 
The McCain-Feingold proposal also explicitly forbids so-called issue ads, ads that mention a candidate's name within 60 days of a Federal election. Issue advocacy can best be defined as any speech relating to issues and the policy positions taken by candidates and elected officials. It can be as simple as a statement such as, `Senator Smith's position on school vouchers is dead wrong.' Or it can be as involved as a multimillion dollar campaign of broadcast and print advertisements that spreads the same message. The Constitution protects the right of any group or individual to engage in issue advocacy. It is the essence of free speech. 
Attempts to regulate and require disclosure of issue advocacy expenditure through statute and through FEC regulation have repeatedly been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and lower Federal courts. The Court has always viewed issue advocacy as a form of speech that deserves the highest degree of protection under the first amendment. Not only has the Court been supportive of issue advocacy, the justices have affirmatively stated that they are untroubled by the fact that issue advertisements may influence the outcome of an election. In fact, in Buckley versus Valeo, the court stated: 
The distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of the election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application. Candidates, especially incumbents, are often intimately tied to public issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on various public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S.1, 42 (1976). 
Moreover, defenders of the first amendment know that the freedom to engage in robust political debate in our democracy will be at risk if the Congress or the FEC is given the authority to ban issue ads close to an election, or evaluate the content of issue ads to determine if they are really a form of express advocacy. The Supreme Court recognized this danger long before Buckley versus Valeo. In 1945, in Thomas versus Collins, the Court states: 
. . . the supposedly clear-cut distinction between discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and meaning. Such a distinction offers no security for free discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and trim Thomas v. Collins 323 U.S. 516 (1945). 
McCain-Feingold would impose regulations on issue advocacy in violation of Court declarations. Advocacy groups such as the National Right to Life, Sierra Club, and National Taxpayers Union, to name just a few, would be severely circumscribed in the exercise of their first amendment rights. The FEC has a poor track record of trying to broadly interpret current election statues to encompass issue advocacy speech. 
In fact, as recently as October 6, 1997, the Supreme Court let stand a circuit court decision striking FEC regulations because they infringed upon a group's right to characterize a candidate's position on abortion rights. Maine Right to Life v, FEC (1997WL274826, 65USWL3783) (October 6, 1997) (Case number 96-1818). 
The result of the McCain-Feingold 60-day ban on issue advocacy before an election will be that associations or groups of citizens could not characterize a candidate's record on radio and television during that period. It would, thus, severely limit citizen involvement and speech. 
The only recourse would be for such associations--nonprofit 501(c)3 and 501(c)4 organizations--to create new institutional entities--political action committees [PAC's]--to legally speak within 60 days before an election. Such groups would, thereby, also be forced to disclose all contributors to the new PAC. 
Not all members of nonprofit organizations want to become members of PAC's. Separate accounting procedures, new legal costs, and separate administrative processes would be imposed on these groups, merely so that their members could preserve their first amendment rights. 
It is noteworthy that none of these proposals seek to regulate the ability of the media to exercise its enormous license to editorialize in favor or against candidates at any given time. 
Finally, as noted, McCain-Feingold does not ensure that American citizens have the right to voluntarily participate in the political process. I am specifically referring to the protection from mandatory withdrawals of dues from a worker's paycheck for political activities without prior approval. Contrary to the claims of its supporters, McCain-Feingold does not provide such protection. 
As written, the McCain-Feingold legislation applies only to nonunion member employees. These are workers who choose not to join a union, but who under a collective bargaining agreement must pay dues--that is, agency fees--to support the costs of union representation. McCain-Feingold covers only 10 percent of the roughly 18 million dues-paying employees nationwide. I support Senator Lott's Paycheck Protection Act, which covers all 18 million. 
McCain-Feingold also requires labor unions to notify these nonunion members that they are entitled to request a refund of the portion of their dues or agency fees used for political purposes. The effect of this proposal is to place the burden on the worker--after the fact--to petition for a refund of these automatically withdrawn dues. By contrast, Senator Lott's Paycheck Protection Act requires unions to obtain union and nonunion employee's written permission first before using any portion of his or her dues for political activities. 
Simply put, I believe all contributions to political activities should be voluntary. No one should have automatic political withdrawals from his or her paycheck unless consent is first given. The Paycheck Protection Act codifies this right. McCain-Feingold does not. 
To conclude, I strongly believe certain aspects of our campaign finance system need reform. But reform that is consistent with the principles I outlined earlier. Although well intentioned, McCain-Feingold layers more regulation on top of current regulation and also infringes upon the constitutional rights to free speech and association. And it does not guarantee voluntary participation in the political process. For these reasons I cannot support it in its current form.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Georgia for taking this time this morning to bring to the attention of our colleagues and the American people again the abuses of the Internal Revenue Service and the necessity for fundamental tax reform as one of the solutions to those abuses. 
I also want to commend the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for holding the hearings last week to expose the problems in the Internal Revenue Service's dealings with taxpayers and to thank the taxpayers and the IRS employees who had the courage to come forward and tell their stories. Although we all knew there were serious problems, I do not think that any of us realized the extent to which there are problems with the way that IRS does its business, as we learned those things from the hearings. 
As a matter of fact, as Senator Roth put it, we found that the IRS far too often targets vulnerable taxpayers, treats them with hostility and arrogance, uses unethical and even illegal tactics to collect money that sometimes is not even owed, and uses quotas to evaluate its employees. It is behavior that is clearly unacceptable. 
Obviously, I think we need to say at the outset that most IRS employees are law abiding and professional. We recognize that they have a very difficult and, indeed, thankless task of administering a Tax Code that is exceedingly complex, it is filled with contradictory provisions and open to differing interpretations. But the IRS has tremendous power, power that can bankrupt families, can put people out of their homes, literally ruin lives, and that makes abuse of that power intolerable. 
The Finance Committee has been fielding calls from thousands of taxpayers all across the country with horror stories about their encounters with the IRS. My office has been taking calls, too, most frequently from taxpayers who are so fearful of IRS retaliation that they are leery of leaving their names or addresses. 
We heard, for example, from a taxpayer who was hounded by the IRS for overpaying his taxes. The IRS put one constituent through the wringer of audits annually for 20 years and never found anything wrong. Another person received a tax refund in error from the IRS. Knowing that it was in error, the constituent never cashed the check, yet when the IRS discovered its own error later, it demanded the refunded check back with interest. One family had a lien placed on its house, worked out a payment plan with one of the IRS agents, only to have another IRS agent later institute foreclosure proceedings. 
What is most galling, I think, to the taxpayers is not that they have to pay taxes, clearly, but there is virtually no recourse when the IRS makes an error. The cost of setting things right, hiring attorneys, CPA's, and the like can be so high that people agree to pay the taxes and penalties that sometimes they do not even owe. In fact, reports are that the Clinton IRS has been boosting its efforts to catch people at the low end of the income scale. According to IRS data, the chance of an audit actually quadrupled between 1990 and 1996 for people reporting annual incomes of less than $25,000. By contrast, the odds of $100,000-plus filers being hit with an audit dropped 40 percent. 
The Clinton administration, which likes to portray itself as being on the side of the little guy, has been quick to discount all of this taxpayer angst. `We shouldn't politicize it,' the President said of the IRS, despite reports that the Clinton IRS itself has been singling out high-profile critics of the administration for audits. 
Legislation has been introduced in both the House and Senate to begin to rein in the IRS. For example, Senators Grassley and Kerrey introduced the IRS Reform and Restructuring Act here in the Senate. 
But I do not think we should be under any illusion that an IRS bill alone will solve the problem. Our Nation's Tax Code as currently written amounts to more than 17,000 pages of confusing, seemingly contradictory tax law provisions. We need to reform the IRS, but unless that reform is followed up with a more fundamental overhaul of the entire Internal Revenue Code, problems with collections and enforcement are likely to persist. If the Tax Code cannot be deciphered, it is going to invite different interpretations from different people, and that is where the problems with the IRS arise. 
Replacing the existing code with a simpler, fairer, flatter tax would facilitate compliance by taxpayers, offer fewer occasions for intrusive IRS investigations, and eliminate the need for special interests to lobby for complicated tax loopholes. 
There are a variety of approaches to fundamental reform that are pending before the Congress, including the Shelby-Armey flat-rate income tax, the Shaefer-Tauzin national sales tax and the Kemp Commission simpler, single-rate tax. Each has a passionate advocate in Congress and around the country. Any one of these options would be preferable to the existing income tax system. 
So why have we not settled on one of them and pressed on with the job of fundamental tax reform? The answer is that while there is overwhelming public consensus in favor of an overhaul of the Tax Code, a public consensus has yet to emerge in favor of a sales tax or a flat tax or some alternative. Given President Clinton's lack of support for any fundamental tax reform, it is likely to take a broad public consensus, the likes of which we haven't seen in recent years, to drive such a tax overhaul plan through the Congress and past the President's veto pen. 
Steve Forbes made tax reform the central theme of his campaign for the Presidency 1 1/2 years ago. In fact, he carried the Arizona primary in large part because his tax plan really resonated with the voters in my State. Yet he failed to win the nomination, and neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole pursued the issue with much passion or conviction. I think it will take a national campaign to build the kind of consensus 
that will be needed to move forward with fundamental tax reform, which is probably the most momentous undertaking of the century. 
The Finance Committee hearings about taxpayer abuse by the IRS, the Kemp Commission's recommendation in favor of fundamental tax reform last year, new proposals to sunset the IRS Code, and the debate that sponsors of the flat tax and sales tax are expected to take on the road across the country within the next few months, all will help to move the debate forward. 
In conclusion, we can pass an IRS reform bill to rein in the IRS and make sure that it treats taxpayers fairly and reasonably and respectfully. But let us not fool ourselves. The IRS cannot be faulted for a tax code that is too complex and filled with contradictory provisions. Until the Tax Code is simplified, problems in one form or another are likely to persist. We must use this opportunity to begin the debate about fundamental tax reform. 
Again, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Georgia for taking the leadership to engage in discussion today.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will not raise a point of order against Senator Mack's amendment. Though I continue to have numerous concerns about the proposed measure, it has been improved since the original Clinton administration proposal was offered. 
I am supportive of allowing those Central Americans who came to this country during the 1980's in order to flee persecution, and other forms of danger, to have the opportunity to apply for relief from deportation under the suspension of deportation application rules that existed prior to the passage of last year's immigration reform bill. 
During the 1980's thousands of our neighbors from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua came to this country to escape civil war. These individuals were granted temporary protected status [TPS], and were allowed to stay in the United States and work because of the foreign policy issues at hand. 
During such time, these Central Americans should have been afforded a proper opportunity to have asylum applications processed, but some were denied this opportunity. As a result, these individuals, made up of Salvadorans and Guatemalans who are sometimes referred to as the American Baptist Churches [ABC] case group, were given another opportunity to have their asylum cases heard. This group is also comprised of Nicaraguans who participated in the Nicaraguan Review Program. 
If such asylum applications were denied, the Central Americans were to be afforded the opportunity to apply for what is known as suspension of deportation. That means that, even if they were denied asylum, but could prove that they were persons of good moral character, had been living in the United States for 7 years, and could prove that deportation would cause extreme hardship to either the immigrant or a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant, the Attorney General could suspend the alien's deportation. 
However, in the ensuing years, the U.S. asylum system has become so backed-up that upward of 240,000 Central Americans' asylum cases have not been resolved. As a result, the process for applying for suspension of deportation has been delayed as well. 
Many of us argue that these Central Americans should be allowed to go through the suspension of deportation process that existed prior to the passage of the Immigraton Act of 1996 because most have lived here since the 1980's and were led to believe that their claims to asylum, or that their pleas to adjust to legal status, would be processed under pre-1996 rules. 
The Mack amendment will afford these Central Americans who fled here amid civil war and chaos in the 1970's and 1980's a fair chance to show that their deportation would cause extreme hardship. 
The Mack amendment has been improved substantially in one critical area. Initially, the proposal allowed any individual, not just Central Americans, in deportation proceedings as of April 1, 1997, to apply for suspension of deportation under the old rules--7 years in U.S., good moral character, extreme hardship--instead of the new tougher rules under the Immigration Act of 1996. The revised Mack amendment will allow those Central Americans, who came here to flee civil strife and war in the 1980's, to apply for suspension of deportation under the old rules. Individuals who have simply come here illegally will be required to apply for suspension of deportation under the new Immigration Act of 1996 rules. The new rules require such illegal immigrants to prove, like the old law, that they are of good moral character. But, in addition, they must prove that they have been in the United States continuously for 10 years and demonstrate that removal would cause extreme and unusual hardship to a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant, but not to the illegal immigrant himself. 
The fact that this amendment has been revised to include only Central Americans is important--during all of the meetings I have had on this issue, and of all of the correspondence I have received, none have suggested that any individuals other than those Central Americans who fled to the United States in the 1980's should be processed under old Immigration Act suspension standards. I am pleased that the Mack proposal limits the scope in this area. 
A provision of the Mack amendment that I continue to be concerned about concerns a numerical cap included in last year's Immigration Act. The Immigration Act of 1996 imposed a cap of 4,000 on the number of suspension of deportation cases that can be adjudicated in a given year. The Mack proposal removes the numerical cap of 4,000. 
Even though the necessary adjustments have been made to ensure that only a specific group of individuals will be allowed to have their suspension of deportation cases heard under the old rules, the fact is, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, approximately 150,000 Central Americans will actually be adjusting their status to permanent legal resident. These additional permanent resident numbers should be offset in other areas of legal immigration. During the negotiation on this amendment, many of us suggested that we increase the number of individuals who will be adjudicated per year from 4,000 to 14,000, but include these numbers in our annual count of legal immigration and ensure, as a result of the addition, that legal immigration does not increase. The Mack proposal should be modified to reinstate the cap, but at 14,000 annually, with an offset in legal immigration that ensures that legal immigration does not increase. 
Another concern I have about the Mack proposal is its silence about whether thousands of individuals who entered the country illegally, with no connection to any of these formerly war-torn countries, should be exempted from one of the new tougher standards against illegal immigration in the Immigration Act of 1996. Specifically, the Mack amendment is silent on the issue of the N-J-B case. The N-J-B case determined that section 309(C)5 of the Immigration Act of 1996 means that `period of continuous residence' stopped when an alien was served with an order to show cause before enactment of the Immigration Act of 1996, and that such time stops when an alien is, or was, served a notice to appear after enactment of the Immigration Act of 1996. In other words, the Bureau of Immigration Appeals has interpreted the provision to mean that those aliens applying for suspension of deportation cannot count as time spent here in the United States that time spent here after having received an order. If congressional intent is not clarifed in this area, it has been made clear that the Clinton administration will seek to administratively overturn the N-J-B decision. 
Legislation introduced by Representative Lamar Smith would clarify congressional intent. It provides that the period of time that an individual is considered to have been in the United States stops when an order to show cause was issued, except for those Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Nicaraguans who fled here during the 1970's and 1980's to escape civil strife and persecution. Under the Smith proposal, these Central Americans would be allowed to continue to count the time spent here in the United States after having received an order to show cause. 
Mr. President, many people are legitimately concerned about the effects of the removal of these Central Americans from the United States. It is my hope that, as we work toward a D.C. appropriations conference report, a modified version of this amendment can be achieved to the satisfaction of all interested parties.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to encourage the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Development to address the issue of occupancy standards when the public housing reform bill goes to conference committee. Earlier this year, Senator Faircloth and I introduced the State Housing Protection Act which transfers from HUD to the States, the authority to set occupancy standards. Yet, the committee did not address the matter when it considered its public housing reform bill. 
 Mr. President, Senator Faircloth and I have worked on this issue for 2 years. In the 104th Congress, Senator Faircloth and I blocked HUD from imposing national occupancy standards until it completed an official rule. Soon thereafter, we introduced a bill with Representative McCollum which prohibited HUD from setting a national occupancy standard. The House included that bill in its 1996 public housing reform bill, but it died in conference committee late last year. 
In May of this year, the House passed its public housing reform bill which included a section that prohibits the Secretary of HUD from establishing a national occupancy standard. Senator Faircloth and I have tried to change the current policy on occupancy standards because we believe that HUD generally has pursued an occupancy standard policy that encourages overcrowding, thereby depreciating housing stock that is scarce to begin with. We believe that HUD is poorly serving lower-income families and defeating its own purpose. Again, I encourage the members of the conference committee to seriously consider restricting HUD's ability to set a national occupancy standard.

Mr. KYL. As my colleagues can see from the reading of the amendment, it is a very short, very simple amendment, that simply takes $4,800,000 from one project and provides it to another for dealing with the problem of gang violence on our Indian reservations. I ask for my colleagues' support. 
The amendment is cosponsored by the distinguished chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. 
This amendment, as read, would provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement with $4.84 million for antigang activities, equipment, and personnel. The offset would be from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars fund. 
The Senate Judiciary and Indian Affairs Committees held a joint hearing yesterday, Mr. President, which examined the growing problem of gang violence in Indian country. Therefore, I think it propitious that we are able to offer the amendment today to help alleviate the problem that was identified in that hearing. 
We heard from representatives of several Indian tribes, as well as the Justice Department, about the problem of gang violence on our reservations. 
Here are some of what we found. 
According to the Justice Department, violent crime nationwide has declined significantly between 1992 and 1996. The overall violent crime rate has dropped about 17 percent, and homicides are down 22 percent. That is the good news. 
Here is the bad news. In the same period of time, homicides in Indian country rose an astonishing 87 percent, Mr. President. The Indian Health Service tells us that the homicide rate among Indians is the highest among any ethnic group in the country--2 1/2 times the rate among white Americans. Numerous tribes, including the Navajo Nation in my State of Arizona, record homicide rates that exceed those of notoriously violent urban areas in our country. 
The FBI reports a dramatic increase in violent crime attributable to gangs in Indian country, nearly doubling between 1994 and 1997. The BIA's law enforcement division identified 181 active gangs on or near Indian reservations in 1994. By 1997, that estimate had risen to 375 gangs with approximately 4,650 gang members. The Navajo Nation alone reports at least 75 active gangs. Think about that for a moment, Mr. President. Just one Indian tribe in the State of Arizona has 75 active gangs. 
There is a small reservation just east of the Phoenix area that has 19 active gangs on it. These are among Indian kids. 
On the Menominee reservation in Wisconsin, there was a 293 percent increase in the number of juveniles arrested between 1990 and 1994. And between 1995 and 1997, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of New Mexico has noted an evolution in juvenile killings from reckless manslaughters to vicious, intentional killings. 
The crimes can be heinous. On May 15, 1994, a 20-year-old Subway sandwich shop clerk was gunned down while on the job on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona. That is the reservation I just alluded to a moment ago. Shot six times, including once in the face, young Pat Lindsay later died. His attackers stole sandwiches, chips, and $100 from the sandwich shop. 
On South Dakota's Lower Brule Reservation in 1996, four gang members broke into a police officer's car and threw in a Molotov cocktail. 
Mr. President, why is it that Indian country is particularly susceptible to gang violence? Part of the answer lies in demographics. The American Indian population is fast growing and increasingly youthful. Based on the 1990 census, 33 percent of the Indian population was younger than 15-years-old versus 22 percent of the general population. 
On the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, about half of the reservation's population is expected to be under the age of 18 by the year 2000. 
Another reason for the growing problem is socioeconomic. American Indians lag in comparison to the general population, experiencing cultural disruption, poverty, chronic unemployment, and disproportionate rates of alcoholism and substance abuse. These create an environment in which gangs can flourish. 
Insufficient law enforcement and detention capability also contribute to the problem. Juveniles may be arrested, but tribes often lack the detention facilities, the probation officers, adequate social services, including substance abuse programs, creating a revolving door for these young people. 
So, Mr. President, the needs for this funding are apparent and urgent. 
I realize of course the need to offset the additional funding proposed in this amendment, this $4.8 million. The offset we are proposing comes from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Funding for the center would be set at the level recommended in the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill--$1 million. The reduction, I said, amounts to $4.8 million.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as reported in this Post article, the Wilson Center selects about 35 fellows each year who receive an average stipend of $43,000 to spend their time studying and writing. The only requirement of the fellows is that in addition to fulfilling their study objectives, they provide a 5-minute presentation on their project to their colleagues and staff. 
A review of the center's operations by the National Academy for Public Administration earlier this year portrays the center as a splintered operation, ineffective, and drifting. The House Appropriations Committee's report on the Interior bill notes that the only accomplishment the academy could cite for the center was obtaining new office space on Pennsylvania Avenue. 
The House committee concluded: 
[T]he Center has operated so long without a clear mission that it may be impossible to reestablish one within an organization that has no relevance to real world public policy issues. 
It seems to me that we could put this $4.8 million currently allocated to an operation that has been widely recognized as drifting and ineffective toward the real and growing problem of gang violence in Indian country. That is what this amendment is all about, Mr. President. 
I express my appreciation to Chairman Campbell and to Chairman Hatch for joining me in this amendment and for their leadership on this issue generally. I hope this amendment will be accepted and that we will begin putting the resources we need into fighting the growing problem of gang violence in Indian country. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KYL. That is fine. I will speak for a few minutes. I know Senator Bumpers is anxious to present another amendment, and I don't intend to take a lot more time. 
But I would like, Mr. President, to get to the essence of what we are trying to accomplish here because the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has made some constructive suggestions in the end, however, which do not capture the spirit of this amendment. 
The whole point of this amendment is to prioritize among scarce resources. 
It is true that we have funded Indian programs this year to the extent that we thought was possible, and that represents an increase over last year, and it represents an increase more than the other programs within this budget were increased. 
But, Mr. President, that is not to say much, because the needs of our Indian communities are so significantly greater than the amount of money that we can provide that this is a scant comfort, I think, to those in our Indian communities. 
I detailed, and my colleague Senator Campbell from Colorado detailed, some of the things which we learned in the hearings yesterday jointly held which discussed the dire situation on our Indian reservations today regarding gang violence and the need to, obviously, do much, much more in a concerted way to alleviate that problem now. 
So, while it is true that we could take money from some other Indian program and apply it to this program, I don't see that as a solution given all of the other needs that exist on our Indian reservations. 
While it is also true that we have allocated $13 million toward a very specific program--not to the BIA but the money goes to the BATF, a totally different program for training--while it is true that that money is in this budget, that is not an adequate substitute for what we are trying to provide for in terms of very special operations requirements to deal with the problems of gang violence. 
Just to reiterate a couple of things--I will not take long--but there are half as many law enforcement officers per capita in Indian country as there are in the small communities outside Indian country. 
We are not just talking about training people. We are talking about hiring people to be on the job and doing their job. In terms of the detention facilities and all of the other personnel that are required, in every category it is far less than needed in Indian country, and that is one of the reasons, as I pointed out from the testimony, that you have this difficult problem of gang violence. 
So when the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee says, well, one thing we could do is simply take money from another part of the Indian budget and put it into here, that is true, but that is really in a sense robbing Peter to pay Paul. 
What we are suggesting, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee and myself, is to prioritize in a larger sense from the entire budget that we have under consideration here, this Interior appropriations budget. 
What we are asking, Mr. President, is this question: As between the funding that is being provided by the Federal Government, the Federal component to the Woodrow Wilson Program and this particular need, which one is more important in today's America? Which one does the Senate justify better to the taxpayers of America? Both Senator Campbell and I have been very clear that we are not attempting to kill the Woodrow Wilson Center. As a matter of fact, it receives more in private funding than it does in Government funding. We are simply reducing the amount of Federal Government funding to the level recommended by the House of Representatives. 
Last year, its budget was something like $12.5 million, and, as I said, more than half of that was from the private sector rather than from this Interior appropriation. So this is not an effort to kill that center. But I do think that because of the criticisms leveled at the center, among others, from the National Academy of Public Administration, I think a study of significance and objectivity, because of some of those criticisms I think it is wise for us to ask whether or not a priority of spending taxpayer dollars should put those moneys into this program as opposed to the one which everyone here has said deserves support, our attempt to deal with Indian gang violence.

Mr. KYL. I just wanted to respond to Senator Moynihan, to the Senator's comment about the $43,000 stipends. According to the article in the Washington Post, which I submitted for the Record a moment ago, by Stephen Barr writing about the Woodrow Wilson Living Memorial--and I quote now: 
The Center annually selects about 35 fellows who receive an average stipend of $43,000 and spend their time studying and writing. 
Also if one does math of the $12,500,000 budget, roughly, of the program, I believe about $1.7 million of that is allocated for the stipend. And if you divide that number it averages out to something over $40,000 a year. So that is where I got my information that the average stipend is about $43,000.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just wanted to make one comment and then close the debate and ask for the yeas and nays. I want to reassure my colleague from Utah that our amendment does not eliminate the Woodrow Wilson Center. It is not our intention to eliminate the Woodrow Wilson Center. And nothing in it does eliminate the Woodrow Wilson Center. The majority of its funds come from the private sector. One could argue that removing this $4.8 million would have a significant impact upon the Woodrow Wilson Center, but several times in the presentation you talked about eliminating it. I just want the record to be clear that our amendment does not do that.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Forest and Public Lands of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on an issue related to the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. In the first year of operation of Fee Demonstration projects, flaws in the program's application are coming to light. These are flaws that I believe can be corrected through a clarification of the policy articulated by Congress in 1996. 
I am generally pleased with the overall results of the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. As various Fee Demo projects have been implemented, some problems have occurred. Public acceptance of new or higher fees has been enthusiastic in some quarters and hostile in others. However, the program has shown promise overall. 
Constituents have brought to my attention the threat of private sector displacement by recreation managers in some National Forests. As private permit terms expire, it appears at some Fee Demo sites there is an intent to discontinue reliance on the private sector for delivery of recreation goods and services. In other instances, the agencies are choosing to go into direct competition with the private sector. The Forest Service will now be offering so-called Heritage Expeditions, which may evolve as whitewater rafting expeditions, archaeological digs, or expeditions into Indian Country--activities offered in abundance by community recreation programs, outfitters and guides, environmental educators, lodges, marinas and dude ranches throughout rural America. 
If this type of activity is allowed under Fee Demo, more and more concessions may likely be taken from private sector operators and placed into the hands of federal employees to operate. At a time when federal employment rolls are being steadily trimmed, new employees will be required at recreation sites to collect fees, perform maintenance, plan and participate in interpretive and recreational activities. I do not believe this was the intent of the Fee Demonstration Program. 
This problem seems to be developing in other states. We need to send a clear message to the land management agencies involved in the Fee Demo project that Congress did not authorize this program to enable the agencies to displace or discourage existing and future investment by the private sector.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton amendment which would give the States more flexibility and resources to create quality education reform plans that address the specific needs of their particular students. 
As reported recently by the Heritage Foundation, the Federal Government annually spends $100 billion in direct and indirect education costs, of which only $13.1 billion makes it to local school districts. If the majority of these funds went to the States and local school districts, I believe the concerns of parents about the quality of their children's education would be more effectively addressed than by the faceless bureaucracy in the Department of Education. 
Polls taken in Arizona and across America consistently demonstrate that Americans consider the quality of education to be their most serious concern. Further, a survey reported in the Washington Post in September 1996 shows that Americans consider the decay of the public schools to be the country's most pressing problem. A surprising 62 percent of those surveyed felt that `the American educational system will get worse instead of better.' In my view, nothing is more important to the future of our country than whether our children are academically well-prepared. 
We fail the fundamental tests of parenthood and good citizenship if we let our children down by failing to impart to them the skills and values they need to govern themselves and this country, and to compete in the global marketplace of the 21st century. Yet, poll after poll shows that Arizonans and Americans alike are concerned about the dumbing down of the politically correct education their children are receiving, the safety of the schools they attend, the general lack of discipline meted out in those schools, and parents' inability to choose to send their children to the school that best fits their kid's individual needs. 
The State of Arizona has taken some important steps to address these concerns and to come up with solutions. For instance, Arizona, using a creative legislative approach, recently enacted a law creating an income-tax credit available for donations to private schools. The private schools will pool the tax credit money in a scholarship fund to be used to finance full or partial scholarships for any students on a first-come, first-served basis. 
The Gorton Amendment, by giving states even more control over their education resources, would allow States more latitude to implement creative education reform plans specifically tailored to their particular needs. 
What the Gorton Amendment would do, with some exceptions, would bundle all funds from the Federal Government which go to support K-12 education and send those funds directly to school districts. 
Why do we need the Gorton Amendment? There are too many Federal education programs. So many in fact, no one seems to be able to agree on exactly how many there are. One count discovered 760 education programs totaling several billion dollars. With such a large number of programs funded by the Federal Government, it's no wonder there is such a concern about undue Federal influence over the operation of local schools, or whether they are being administered in an efficient way. 
The people best equipped to make decisions regarding the education of our children are the parents, teachers, principles, school board members and administrators of our local schools. It's not that Members of Congress don't have an interest in the education of children. It's just that we don't have the best information upon which to base decisions. 
Congress is simply not close enough to the problems school districts face to be able to dictate through Federal mandates how they should address their concerns. This is not to say the Congress does not have a responsibility assisting in the education of America's children. However, we also must see to it that those who are closest to our students have the resources they need. 
Also, we must ensure that they are not hamstrung by the rules and regulations set by a group of individuals who have never set foot in their school. 
In sum, Mr. President, the Gorton amendment would empower States, school districts, and parents to take a more active role in the education of their children.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle amendment expressing the sense of the Senate in support of Pell grants. I would say to my colleagues, however, that I think we have already achieved what is intended here when the Senate considered my amendment last week. 
Even though my amendment to increase Pell grant funding was not adopted, the Senator from Pennsylvania, the distinguished chairman of the Labor-HHS appropriations subcommittee, assured the Senate that, to the extent the committee could yield to the Pell grant number in my amendment and the House bill--a figure that was $528 million higher than in the Senate's Labor-HHS bill--Senate conferees would do so. 
Let me read back Chairman Specter's remarks from the Record: 
I might say to my colleague from Arizona that with the additional arguments he has advanced today in a very cogent way, to the extent we can yield to the House figure, we will try to do so when we get to conference. 
Mr. President, in many ways, the vote on the Daschle amendment should be an easy vote for Members of the Senate. It expresses support for the very important Pell Grant Program, but does not say where the increased funding will come from. It is not binding on the Senate. 
By contrast, it was my amendment last week that expressed more than non-binding support. It would have provided the actual dollars to extend Pell grant eligibility to additional categories of needy students, including independent students without dependents. 
I am sure it is not the minority leader's intent to merely add the cost of that expansion to the budget deficit--to the debt that our children and grandchildren will ultimately have to repay. But if education is as high a priority as we all believe it is, we ought to be willing to put funding for Pell grants ahead of other programs. That is what I attempted to do last week with my amendment to fund Pell grants with offsets from the LIHEAP Program. 
I can understand that some people did not agree that LIHEAP should be cut. Those who believed LIHEAP was a higher priority than education and Pell grants voted against my amendment. But then why not identify some alternative source of funding?

Mr. KYL. As I noted before, Chairman Specter has already indicated that he will move toward the higher numbers for Pell grants in conference. And the Labor Committee has indicated that it will act on the necessary authorization. So I think we have already accomplished what is intended here in the Daschle amendment. Nevertheless, since this represents another opportunity to express support for Pell grants, I will support it. However, I do hope that the conference committee will offset the increase from savings in other programs, and not just add the cost to the deficit.

Mr. KYL. Let me ask this question of the Senator from Oklahoma. Since this is boiling down to a question of whether the taxpayers of the United States should pay for a union election or whether the union should pay for its own election, why was it that the consent decree that some of our colleagues seem to be focusing so much attention on was entered into in the first instance? Why was the U.S. Government involved in dealing with the Teamsters Union in the first instance? And why was it that a special officer to oversee the election had to be assigned for that, or the parties agreed to have that officer oversee the election to ensure that it would be a fair election? Why was the U.S. Government obligated to provide these funds for this labor union, for a private labor union election?

Mr. KYL. If I could ask this question. So the reason that my constituents in Arizona had to help pay for this union election is because of past fraud and alleged illegal conduct of the union. That is why they are having to pay for this union election, or why they paid for the last union election; is that correct?

Mr. KYL. Obviously. The last question I ask is, why, if it is the union's elected officials' fault that the taxpayers had to spend this money in the first instance because they had allowed the fraud and alleged corruption to come into the union and tossed out the ability of the union to conduct its own election on behalf of its members, why, once the taxpayers paid for an election, should they have to pay for it a second time? The taxpayers didn't do anything wrong; it was the union officials.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
At this time, let me explain the reasons for my amendment to increase Pell grant funding. I submitted a statement for the Record yesterday. But I would like to discuss it in a little bit more detail today. 
There is particular reason for us to take this action which would bring us closer to the administration's request and into line with the recommendation from the House of Representatives. It seems odd to me that the Senate would not be willing to support Pell grant funding at the same level as recommended by the Appropriations Committee in the House of Representatives. This amendment would conform the Senate funding level to the House funding level, and there is a particular reason for this amendment coming up. That is, a problem that was created in a previous law with respect to two different groups of students that are funded. I would like to discuss that in a little bit more detail. 
First, let me note the numbers. This amendment would provide an additional $528 million for the Pell Grant Program. It would boost funding to the level recommended by the House Appropriations Committee. The Pell grant funding would go from $6.91 billion to $7.438 billion. The offset is from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which I will discuss in just a moment. 
The Pell grant funding amendment, as I said, is intended to finance changes in eligibility--that is, to correct problems that have arisen as a result of the current law phaseout of certain independent students at income levels that are lower than those for dependent students. Like the House bill, this funding level is contingent upon the authorization committee providing authorization. 
We have letters from both the chairman and ranking members of the House and Senate authorizing committees indicating that should the additional funding be approved they would work for that authorization to be established. 
It is also my understanding that the administration is in agreement with the House of Representative numbers with respect to the Pell grant funding. 
So I think we ought to put at least as high a priority on Pell grants as the President and the House of Representatives in this version of the Labor-HHS bill. 
Here is the problem that was created. In the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 we established a separate allowance for independent students without dependents--independent students, not dependent students--independent students who do not themselves have dependents. 
The problem is, the separate allowance established under the 1992 act. It creates a substantial disparity among these groups of students very much to the disadvantage of the independent students without dependents. The proposed change in eligibility which the funding in my amendment is intended to finance would bring the proportion of students in this group who would be eligible for Pell grants closer to the proportion that existed prior to the establishment of the separate allowance in the 1992 act. Students, incidentally, in this group are typically older students with annual family incomes of between $10,000 and $20,000. 
I obtained from the Department of Education a statistical list for the States of the number of students who lost eligibility under the separate allowance that we created in the 1992 act. Just for the benefit of some of the Senators who are here, I might note some of the numbers with respect to the States involved here. 
In California, for example, 24,314 students lost eligibility as a result of what we did. My amendment would provide a way for these students to go to school. 
In Iowa, the State of the distinguished ranking Member, 4,247 students lost eligibility as a result of what we did. My amendment would reassert their eligibility to provide the funding for that. 
In the State of Michigan, the number of students who lost eligibility, according to the Department of Education, is 15,254; 
In the State of Minnesota, 7,432; 
In the State of Pennsylvania, the State of the distinguished chairman of the committee, 9,535 students lost eligibility as a result of what was done. 
My amendment will restore the funding so that these students will be eligible--will have the funding to get the Pell grants to get their education. 
So we are talking here about a significant number of students that will not be helped if our amendment is not adopted. 
The offset, as I said, is from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, the so-called LIHEAP Program. I know there are some Members who rather reflexably react to any reductions in this program because there is a contingent of their constituency that relies on this program and that reacts very badly if there is an attempt to cut it. But, Mr. President, I think in this case we have to balance the interests of those people with the people who have lost their eligibility under the Pell Grant Program. And, if we do not act, these students are not going to have the opportunity to advance their education. 
So let's talk for just a minute about this tradeoff and about the LIHEAP Program. 
The LIHEAP Program was set up 16 years ago as a temporary program for just a few months to help people get over the energy crisis. The energy crisis is long gone. This is a typical program of the liberal welfare state. It gets established, and then can never be disestablished notwithstanding the fact that the reason for it has long ago disappeared. 
The world is a very different place than it was in 1981. Gone are the long lines at the gas pumps and the skyrocketing energy prices. 
It seems to me, as we prepare for the 21st century, that we should look beyond programs designed to cope with an energy crisis of nearly 20 years ago--a crisis that has come and gone --and focus instead on how to prepare young people for the high-tech more competitive economy of the future. 
That is what this amendment does. 
Mr. President, fuel costs have not only stabilized since 1981, they have declined significantly in real terms; that is, in inflation-adjusted terms. 
For example, I would refer to figures from the Clinton 
administration itself. In its 1995 budget submission the Clinton administration recommended substantial reductions in the LIHEAP Program because it too recognized that the fuel costs had gone down significantly. As noted in the President's budget, `fuel prices have decreased by 40 percent in real terms; the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 percent in real terms; and the percent of income spent for home heating for households at or below 150 percent of poverty guidelines has dropped by about one-third.' The President's budget went on to propose a 50-percent reduction in funding for the program that year. 
Last year, President Clinton proposed outyear costs in LIHEAP--a $90 million reduction in 1999, and a $181 million reduction in the year 2000. The Office of Management and Budget advised my office that the declining figures were due to the standard percentage reductions applied to programs that were not considered a high priority--because of the statistics that I cited earlier from the Clinton administration. 
So, Mr. President, you have the Clinton administration recognizing that we need to increase the Pell grant funding, you have the Clinton administration recognizing that the LIHEAP Program can no longer be justified at its present level, you have the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee recommending that we end this disparity between the two different groups of students funded by Pell grants, and it seems to me that we have an opportunity here with very little detriment to increase the funding for these students. 
The States themselves as I have noted, have already shown a significant ability to meet the energy needs of those that require assistance. 
For example, many States refuse to allow public utilities to shut off power to delinquent customers. And they have set up payment plans and other options. So we do not need the old subsidy to deal with the problem that may exist for some people. 
It just seems to me given the States' track record, obviously, that they care as much about their low-income citizens as people here in Washington, DC, do. Given their track records and the stable or declining price of energy, this is a good time to begin, as the President recommended a couple of years ago, to begin cutting back on LIHEAP so that we can target these resources to other more pressing needs. 
In closing, Mr. President, the bipartisan budget agreement that we passed in July was intended to create new opportunities in education for middle- and upper-income families. It will through a variety of new tax breaks and tax credits. But we have the chance today to target additional Pell grant assistance to more lower- and middle-income people so that all American families will have the same opportunity to secure a brighter future. 
For those, as I said, who react somewhat automatically against this amendment because, as one friend put it, they come from a cold State, I simply think it is very hard to explain why you voted against the level of Pell grant funding recommended by the House of Representatives and the President of the United States simply because you wanted to preserve a 16-year-old temporary subsidy program, the justification for which has long since disappeared. 
This amendment literally represents a choice between an old welfare state subsidy and a brighter future for more young people through education that they might not otherwise receive. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment to add more money to the Pell Grant Program.

Mr. KYL. I certainly appreciate the comments of the Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the committee. I just wanted to comment on two of the points he made. 
It is, indeed, true that the total amount of money to be expended on Pell grants has been increased by about $1 billion. That goes to increase the maximum Pell grant to $3,000. It does not, as the Senator, of course, is well aware, fund this category of people who I contend have been disadvantaged as a result of the 1992 act, the independent students without dependents. So the increase in the funding in the bill has made it better for those who receive the grants, but it has not enabled us to cover the people that I am proposing to cover. 
Second, with respect to the LIHEAP Program, just to make it very clear, this offset does not eliminate the LIHEAP Program. It reduces by about one-half the funding for the LIHEAP Program, which, incidentally, is almost the same amount of reduction that was recommended by President Clinton in his 1995 budget submission.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine, who is going to speak next, but I ask if I can have just 1 minute to respond to one point the Senator from Iowa just made. I think it is important for me to respond to it. 
He said, first, that the inflation-adjusted prices are about the same and then challenged my assertion that the liberal welfare state program, as I described the LIHEAP Program, which I said the need for had largely been eliminated, is similar, in terms of welfare, to the Pell grant funding and suggested perhaps I was failing to appreciate the similarity in both programs being welfare programs. 
I simply wanted to respond to the Senator from Iowa in this fashion. What I said was that once a welfare state program is instituted, it is very difficult to get rid of it even if the need for it has been eliminated or reduced. That, in my opinion--and I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa disagrees with this opinion--but in my opinion, the LIHEAP Program is a program which was originally intended to be temporary. That is a fact. But it has now become permanent notwithstanding, in my opinion, the fact that the need for it has largely been eliminated or reduced, thus demonstrating a program instituted for very good reasons but, in my view, which no longer is justified--as distinguished from the Pell Grant Program. I think none of us would argue the need for that has been reduced or eliminated. 
So my point is not that one is welfare and one is not welfare in the broadest sense of the term, as the Senator from Iowa noted, but rather that the need for one has largely been eliminated, yet it is very difficult if not impossible for us to eliminate these programs once they have begun. 
To the point that the energy costs are about the same as they were, I can only cite the statistics from the Clinton administration budget submitted in 1995. And I am quoting now. 
[F]uel prices have decreased by 40 percent in real terms; the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 percent in real terms; and the percent of income spent for home heating for households at or below 150 percent of poverty guidelines has dropped by about one-third. 
That is the reason for my assertion that the energy costs have indeed gone down dramatically.

Mr. KYL. Relatively speaking, the Senator from Iowa is certainly correct. We would simply then engage in a philosophical debate as to whether or not, if that number continued to drop to one-third and one-tenth and so on, whether the program should continue. My view would be this was a temporary program designed to meet a temporary need, that it was never designed to pay for 100 percent of the bill for heating, and therefore there is a point at which the need for the program should go away, when the prices have been reduced to a certain point. He and I obviously simply disagree about what that point would be.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me simply indicate generally what this amendment does. 
This amendment will provide an additional $528 million for the Pell Grant Program, boosting that level to the amount recommended by the Appropriations Committee. And that money will come from the LIHEAP program. It would be a direct offset. So that the $528 million would come from LIHEAP and would go to fund Pell grants. 
Madam President, this amendment is very simple. It will provide an additional $528 million for the Pell Grant Program, boosting the amount in the bill to the level recommended by the House of Representatives. Pell grant funding would go from $6.910 billion to $7.438 billion. The offset is from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. 
The additional Pell grant funding is intended to finance changes in eligibility--that is, to correct problems that have arisen as a result of the current law phaseout of certain independent students at income levels that are lower than those for dependent students. Like the House bill, the funding is contingent upon the authorizing committees acting on the proposal. I am not attempting an end run around the normal committee process, just attempting to ensure that the funds will be available should the Education Committee concur in the change. 
The Clinton administration originally estimated the cost of the proposal at $725 million in fiscal year 1998, but it is my understanding that administration officials are now satisfied with the House numbers. In any event, I believe we ought to put as high a priority on Pell grants as the House did in its version of the Labor-HHS bill. 
Madam President, it was the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 that established a separate allowance for independent students without dependents. The income protection allowance, which is a fixed amount of a family's income that is excluded from need determination, is based on the family's household size and the number in the household attending college. The problem is that the separate allowance established by the 1992 act creates a substantial disparity among groups of students. 
For example, when compared with other students with the same number of family members in the household and one member in college, the allowance for 1997-1998 is $5,750 less in the case of married students without dependents. It is $5,940 less in the case of single students without dependents, according to the Department of Education. And because the income protection allowance for independent students without dependents is not indexed for inflation, the gap can only be expected to widen each year. 
The proposed change in eligibility, which the funding in my amendment is intended to finance, would bring the proportion of students in this group who would be eligible for Pell grants closer to the proportion that existed prior to the establishment of the separate allowance in the 1992 act. Students in this group are typically older students with annual family incomes of between $10,000 and $20,000. 
Madam President, here is a State-by-State breakdown of the number of students who lost eligibility under the separate allowance. The numbers, which were supplied by the Education Department, compare the period 1992-1993 before the 1992 reauthorization with the period 1993-1994 after reauthorization:

The figures I just cited will give Senators a rough idea of the number of additional students that would benefit from the added funding in my amendment. 
Madam President, Professor David Breneman, the dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia, testified before the Senate Finance Committee back in April about the effectiveness of various forms of Federal aid. He concluded that `the Pell Grant program has the merit of targeting aid to students who would be unable to attend college without the grant.' In other words, Pell grants are probably the most efficient and effective way of targeting Federal aid to those students who need it most. And unlike other forms of assistance, which might reach those who have the means and determination to attend college with or without the Government's help, it does less to fuel tuition inflation. 
Now I know the offset for the additional Pell grant funding will be controversial for some. It would come from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP], a program that was set up nearly 16 years ago to temporarily--temporarily--supplement existing cash assistance programs and help low-income individuals pay for home fuel costs that were escalating at the time. 
But the world is a very different place than it was in 1981. Gone are the long lines at the gas pumps and skyrocketing energy prices. As we prepare to cross a bridge to the 21st century, we should look beyond programs designed to cope with an energy crisis of 20 years ago--a crisis that has come and gone--and focus instead on how to prepare young people for the high technology, more competitive economy of the future. 
Madam President, fuel costs have not only stabilized since 1981, they have declined significantly in real terms. Figures provided to me by one of Arizona's majority utilities, Arizona Public Service, indicate that average residential rates for electricity have declined 15 percent in real terms since 1980. And that does not take into account a 1.2-percent rate decrease that just became effective on July 1. 
It is no secret that I have been skeptical of the continued need for LIHEAP. I have offered amendments on the subject several times in recent years. But I would point out that in its fiscal year 1995 budget submission, the Clinton administration, too, recommended substantial reductions in the program. 
As noted in the President's fiscal year 95 budget,  
 * * * fuel prices have decreased by 40 percent in real terms; the cost of electricity has dropped by about 13 percent in real terms; and the percent of income spent for home heating for households at or below 150 percent of poverty guidelines has dropped by about one-third. 
He went on to propose a 50-percent reduction in funding for the program that year. 
Last year, President Clinton proposed outyear cuts in LIHEAP--a $90 million reduction in 1999, and a $181 million reduction in 2000. The Office of Management and Budget advised my office that the declining figures were due to standard percentage reductions applied to programs that were not considered a top priority. 
Last December, it was widely reported that the Clinton administration would recommend a 25-percent reduction in the program this year. So there has been skepticism about the continuing need for the program, even at the White House. 
Madam President, the States themselves have already shown remarkable ability to meet the energy needs of those requiring assistance, refusing to allow public utilities to shut off power to delinquent customers and setting up payment plans and other options. It seems to me that, given the States' track records and the stable or declining price of energy, this is a good time to begin cutting back on LIHEAP spending so that we can target the resources to other pressing needs. 
In closing, the bipartisan budget agreement that we passed in July was intended to extend new opportunities in education to middle- and upper middle-income families, and it will through a variety of new tax credits. But we have the chance today to target additional Pell grant assistance to more lower- and middle-income people, so that all American families have the same opportunity to secure a brighter future. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment to put more money into the Pell Grant Program.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when the budget agreement was announced in May, I expressed a great deal of skepticism about whether it would provide adequate tax relief to hard-working American families, whether Medicare's solvency would be assured, and whether the savings necessary to achieve a balanced federal budget would really be obtained. 
After reviewing the two bills that are before the Senate today--bills intended to implement the budget agreement--I must still conclude that they are, by themselves, inadequate. Too little tax relief is provided to Americans--with or without children--who go to work every day, play by the rules, and struggle to make ends meet. Too little is invested in creating jobs and making our country more competitive. 
The legislation does extend Medicare solvency, but only for a decade. It is disappointing, to say the least, that President Clinton failed to step up to the plate and fight for the significant reforms that an overwhelming, bipartisan majority of the Senate supported to put Medicare on a more stable footing for our children and grandchildren in the decades to come. 
Nevertheless, Mr. President, the bills represent steps in the right direction. They provide at least some tax relief to millions of families who are trying to do right by their children, to young Americans who are striving to get a higher education and make our communities better and more productive places for us to live, and for seniors who need relief from capital gains or estate taxes to make ends meet in their retirement years. 
They will extend Medicare solvency, while expanding the health-care choices available to seniors. There are tough, new antifraud provisions designed to weed out and punish those who would steal Medicare dollars from older Americans. Hundreds of thousands of Americans will be able to save money tax-free to pay for health care in new medical savings accounts, and seniors will no longer be denied the right to purchase health services from a doctor of their choosing. 
In addition to Medicare reform, the bill reforms Medicaid, and achieves savings in the Student Loan Program, Federal retirement, and housing. It raises money from the auctioning of broadcast spectrum. In all, the legislation achieves about $130 billion in savings over a 5-year period. 
Should we have done more? Yes. While many people will benefit from the tax-relief bill, many others will be left out. But with President Clinton opposed to a broader tax-relief package, and without the votes to pass a bill over his objection, it is clear that a more far-reaching measure has no chance of passage in the near term. So we are faced with the choice of either providing at least a limited amount of tax relief this year, or denying relief to everyone. 
For me, that is an easy choice. We ought to do what we can now and keep fighting for more. This is by no means the end of the fight. Just as the tax relief provided to small businesses last year was not the end of the road, this is not the end, either. It is one more step in the direction of providing the tax relief that the American people so badly need and deserve. 
The amendment I offered to the budget agreement back in May makes clear that the door is open for additional tax relief next year, and I intend to be back fighting for more. And in any event, interim tax relief, which really adds a great deal of complexity to the Tax Code, is no substitute for permanent structural reforms that will move us toward a fairer, flatter tax that will provide relief for everyone. 
Mr. President, the cornerstone of the tax bill before the Senate today is the $500-per-child tax credit that Senators Grams, Coats, Hutchinson, Nickles, and I introduced on the day Congress reconvened this year. It is an idea that many of us have pursued for a number of years, and it has been a top goal of the Republican Congress since 1994. With the idea finally on the verge of becoming law, others are now claiming credit. As President Kennedy put it, `victory has a thousand fathers.' So be it. 
Mr. President, just think what $500 per child will mean to a married couple with two children and an income of $35,000 a year. That family will see a 40 percent reduction in its tax bill. Think what that will mean in terms of helping to pay for child care, health or dental care, clothes, or a trip to summer camp. Obviously, $500 is no panacea--anyone who has raised a child knows how expensive a proposition that can be--but it will help. 
Think what a single mom in the inner city could do with an extra $500 per child. It might help provide after-school care to keep a son or daughter off the streets, safe, and out of trouble. Maybe it would help her send her child to a better, safer school, or just put food on the table. 
We are talking here about letting hard-working, tax-paying families keep more of what they earn to do what they know is best for themselves and their children. We put our faith and trust in families. 
We also create new opportunities in this bill for people to save for their retirement in enhanced individual retirement accounts. Nonworking spouses will be able to save a full $2,000 annually in an IRA regardless of the working spouses' access to a pension plan. Penalty-free early withdrawals would be allowed for first-time home purchases to make the dream of home ownership a reality for more Americans. For those trying to sell their homes, we provide a meaningful capital-gains exclusion. 
This legislation provides significant new incentives to help people save for a college education. And what better way to ensure that the next generation is prepared to lead us to a brighter future than to ensure greater access to higher learning: new opportunities to save tax-free in education savings accounts, an extension of the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance, and a $2,500-per-year student-loan interest deduction. 
Mr. President, the family and education credits are probably the most popular parts of this tax-relief package, but there are other important provisions included as well. 
I know that not as many people are concerned about capital-gains and estate-tax relief compared to the education tax credits in particular, but I would suggest that unless good paying jobs are available for young people when they graduate, education tax credits will amount to little more than empty promises. We need to do more, and that is why the capital-gains and estate-tax provisions are in this bill. 
Three decades ago, the Nation's bipartisan leadership joined together in calling for a deep reduction in the capital-gains tax rate. In fact, it was President John F. Kennedy who recommended a plan that would have taxed only 30 percent of long-term gains. In other words, President Kennedy would have excluded 70 percent of gains--a far greater reduction than is contained here. 
There was a reason that he called for a significant cut in the capital-gains tax. `The present tax treatment of capital gains and losses is both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth,' the President said. `The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the economy.' 
In other words, if we are concerned about whether new jobs are being created, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the tools they need to do a more efficient job, we should support measures that reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all of these things. Remember, for every employee, there was an employer who took risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer needed capital to start. 
President Kennedy recognized that. He recognized that our country is stronger and more prosperous when our people are united in support of a common goal--and alternatively, that we are weaker and more vulnerable when Americans are divided among lines of race, gender, and income. 
While some politicians may employ divisive class warfare to their political advantage today, President Kennedy simply put good policy ahead of good politics. And I am with him. 
The capital-gains reductions in this bill will help keep the economy on track, producing new jobs and new opportunities for all Americans to get ahead. It will free up resources locked up in old technology and old investments, and make them available to update equipment and factories, and put Americans in a more competitive position in the global marketplace. 
The estate-tax reductions, too, will help create new jobs. According to the Heritage Foundation, outright repeal would create as many as 150,000 new jobs a year. But this bill does not repeal the death tax. It effectively adjusts the tax for inflation over a 9-year period, and that is all it does. While it provides an additional exemption for family owned businesses and farms, the rules are so complex that I predict few, if any, will actually benefit from them. 
There is something unseemly, though, about a tax that forces grieving families to visit the funeral home and the tax collector at the same time. There is something wrong with a tax that takes more than half of whatever someone has managed to acquire over his or her lifetime with after-tax dollars. The death tax ought to be repealed outright, and I intend to continue to fight for that objective. 
Mr. President, what a difference a Republican majority in Congress has made. In 1993, President Clinton and the Democrat-controlled Congress passed the largest tax increase in history, increased spending and left a budget in deficit for as far as the eye could see. 
This week, Congress will send to the President a budget that aims for balance, limits government spending, extends the solvency of Medicare, and provides badly needed tax relief to millions of Americans. It is safe to say that none of these things could have been achieved without a Republican majority. 
These bills will not accomplish everything we set out to do, but with President Clinton in office, it is unlikely that we can do much more right now. 
I intend to support these bills as steps in the right direction, but I intend to keep pushing next year for the kinds of entitlement reforms that will protect the next generation, and expand on the tax relief that today's generation needs and deserves.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Concurrent Resolution which expresses the sense of the Congress that Russia should refrain from providing additional missile assistance to Iran, and calls for the imposition of sanctions should Russia fail to stop. 
A broad, bipartisan consensus exists among leaders in the Congress and the administration that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and ballistic missiles used to deliver them is one of the key national security challenges facing the United States today. In fact, in 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938 declaring that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them constitutes `an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,' and that he had therefore decided to `declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.' The President reaffirmed this Executive Order in 1995 and 1996. 
The Concurrent Resolution that I have submitted today has bipartisan, bicameral support. Over the past few weeks I have enjoyed working with Representative Jane Harman, the principal sponsor of the resolution in the House of Representatives, and I am pleased to announce that Senators Feinstein, D'Amato, Inhofe, Allard, and Burns are original cosponsors of the legislation. 
This resolution is important because Iran's ballistic missile program--in concert with its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons programs--poses a grave threat to the United States and our allies in the region. 
Iran is a state-sponsor of terrorism led by a regime which is hostile to the United States. 
Its chemical and biological weapons programs, which began in the early 1980's, are now capable of producing a wide variety of highly lethal chemical and biological agents, and Tehran has an aggressive program to develop nuclear weapons. 
In addition, Iran currently possesses Scud-B and Scud-C ballistic missiles, and with Russian assistance, is working to develop longer-range missiles. 
Russia has stated that it recognizes the danger posed by Iran's missile program. At the Helsinki summit in March 1997, President Yeltsin reaffirmed that it was not Moscow's policy to assist Iran's missile program, since such missiles could be used to threaten Russia in the future. In addition, Russia is a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime [MTCR], which regulates the sale of missile technology to non-member nations, and has signed a bilateral agreement with the United States pledging not to conclude additional arms contracts with Iran. 
Despite Russia's assurances and bilateral and international commitments, recent press articles indicate Russian entities have engaged in missile cooperation with Iran. On February 12, 1997, the Los Angeles Times reported that Russia had recently transferred SS-4 missile technology to Iran. The transfer reportedly involved detailed instructions on how to build the missile and some unspecified components. This transfer is of particular concern since the SS-4 has a range of 2,000 km--more than three times greater than any missile currently in Iran's arsenal. 
In addition to the transfer of SS-4 technology, Russia appears to be selling Iran a wide variety of other equipment and material useful in the design and manufacture of ballistic missiles. According to a Washington Times article published on May 22, 1997, Russian entities signed numerous missile-related contracts with Iran's Defense Industries Organization in 1996. The contracts reportedly included deals worth over $100,000 for projects such as the construction of a wind tunnel for missile design, manufacture of missile models, and the sale of missile design software. Construction of the wind tunnel alone is expected to cost several million dollars. 
These press reports are corroborated by an unclassified report to Congress, prepared by the CIA and coordinated throughout the Intelligence Community, that was released in June. The report titled, `The Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions,' states that, `Russia supplied a variety of ballistic missile-related goods to foreign countries [in 1996], especially Iran.' The report also noted that Russia and China continued to be the primary suppliers of missile technology and were `key to any future efforts to stem the flow of dual-use goods and modern weapons to countries of concern.' 
This Concurrent Resolution expresses the sense of the Congress that the President should demand that the Russian government take concrete actions to stop governmental and nongovernmental entities from providing missile assistance to Iran. If Russia fails to respond to United States concerns, the Resolution calls on the President to impose sanctions on the responsible Russian entities in accordance with existing United States law. This resolution is a reasonable response to an important problem. 
I am pleased that Russian President Yeltsin has clearly stated that it is not Russia's policy to assist Iran's missile program. But unfortunately, there continue to be discrepancies between Russian words and deeds. The time has come for Russia's leaders to halt this dangerous missile cooperation with a dangerous regime in Tehran. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to comment on the resolution now before the Senate. It is clear from the number of Members who are signatories to this resolution that the majority of this Chamber has significant reservations, as it should, about the ratification of any international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. I intend to vote for the resolution, but I must say I believe it does not go far enough in bringing to light the faults of the convention. I'd like to amplify some points that are touched upon only briefly in the resolution. 
I am very concerned about the call to move away from voluntary goals, as framed in the original convention, toward legally binding emissions-limitation targets and timetables for the United States, as well as the other developed, or annex I, countries that are party to the convention. The 1992 treaty, ratified by the Senate, called for the economically developed countries to undertake voluntary actions to aim to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, the only major developed nations that will meet this voluntary target of 1990 levels by 2000 are Britain--because it switched its fuel for electricity production from heavily subsidized coal to North Sea natural gas--and Germany--because it is able to count efficiency gains from replacing its ancient East German powerplants. Despite the fact that the United States is expected to miss its own target by about 10 percent, the administration, by signing the Berlin mandate in March of 1995, now believes it is a good idea to pursue additional emissions reduction targets after the year 2000. The Berlin mandate, which was not presented to the Senate for approval, sets up a process to negotiate a new treaty that will: First, commit the United States, and other developed countries to a legally binding agreement--contrary to the earlier approved agreement; and second, specifically exempt the 130 developing countries, including the emerging economies of China, Mexico, and Korea, from any additional commitments. 
It does not make sense, either environmentally or economically, to focus on the nations which are already spending billions on pollution control and making substantial progress, while ignoring the so-called developing countries. U.S. companies, using the best available technology, are able to eliminate a great deal of pollution from their emissions. To achieve an additional increment of pollution reduction requires a much larger amount of money to be spent. Because of the law of diminishing returns, the costs will heavily outweigh any benefits. However, in developing countries, where the pollution control technology is not be as advanced or widespread as it is here in the United States, a dollar spent on pollution control will stretch much further and achieve far more significant reductions in overall pollution. Thus, the cost/benefit ratio favors significant pollution reduction in developing, not developed, countries. 
In addition to the simple cost/benefit analysis, many scientists predict the greatest increase of future greenhouse emissions will come from developing countries like China, Mexico, Brazil, and Korea. As much as 60 percent of global carbon emissions are expected to 
come from such countries in the next few decades, with China becoming the single-largest emitter in the near future. Since these countries are expected to produce the bulk of future greenhouse emissions, exempting them will not reduce net global emissions. Both cost-benefit analysis and common sense say that the most effective way to reduce net global pollution is to reduce emissions in the developing nations. 
While I presume many supporters of this resolution agree that under no circumstances should the United States be subjected to legally binding emissions limitations, I believe the resolution is somewhat unclear. As I read it, it says the United States will agree to legally binding emissions if `the protocol or other agreements also mandates new specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for developing country parties within the same compliance period.' Unfortunately, I believe this condition is not sufficient. As many of you know, it has been interpreted by different people in different ways. Some read it to mean that the Senate will not approve a treaty that does not include identical emissions level and target date requirements. Others, however, have read the same language and determined that it means any treaty must have equal commitments when it comes to setting time tables but not emissions levels. Unfortunately, it is easy to set developing countries on a time table and allow then to continue to pollute in any amount they desire. The emissions levels can be easily set so that the developed countries have very stringent, and perhaps unattainable levels, while the developing countries have very lax, easily reached goals--all the while, all countries are operating within the same time table. The time table alone does not determine the amount of pollution emitted; the emission level is more important. Setting the developing countries to the same timetables without meaningful emissions limitations will not preclude them from emitting larger amounts of greenhouse gases. This approach, I believe, defeats the purpose of the treaty ratified by the Senate, which is to voluntarily reduce greenhouse-gas emissions on a global scale. The original intent was not to legally bind the annex I countries to set timetables and emissions levels while only requiring the developing countries to comply with parallel timetables but not the same emissions standards. 
Also of concern is the fact that the administration is basing its climate-change policy on questionable science. The science on climate change is very much an open inquiry into an as-yet-unconfirmed phenomenon over which the scientific community remains sharply divided. Discrepancies exist in the evidence now being considered. So, before the administration binds the United States legally to costly, and possibly unnecessary, standards and goals, shouldn't we allow for the science on this matter to first evolve and, in turn, allow for us to base our decision on facts? 
Finally, there is the question of why the United States would embark on a course of action that many scientists say would do little environmental good. A report released in January of this year, January 10, 1997, by the Congressional Research Service poses the question: `Given the scientific uncertainties regarding the magnitude, timing, rate, and regional consequences of the potential climatic change, what are the appropriate policy responses?' I believe the appropriate response is to wait for the science to evolve; not to leap into legally binding emission limits that, if developed, would not necessarily improve the environment and would cost American citizens billions of dollars. 
Confirming this approach, Dr. Robert C. Balling, Jr. of Arizona State University issued a report entitled `Global Warming: Messy Models, Decent Data, Pointless Policy.' In it he states, `Global warming is presented as a crisis that can be stopped or minimized with appropriate policy actions. However, the evidence suggests that realistic policies are likely to have minimal climatic impact. Recent research also suggests that a delay in implementing policy responses will have little effect on the efficacy of global warming mitigation strategies.' He continues: `It is absolutely imperative that the policies developed for the global warming issue be built on the best science.' Mr. President, I could not agree more. 
This December in Kyoto, Japan, the administration will further commit itself to the convention; it will be offering protocols to that instrument that lack the necessary support of the scientific community. Because we do not know enough to support these terms and allow for the administration to exploit the ends to justify the means for climate-change policy, the responsibility to ensure that the United States is not legally committed to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions will be placed in the hands of the U.S. Senate. We must preserve the right to question the validity of these protocols. Congressional oversight of the negotiations is crucial and any agreement reached in Kyoto must be brought before us for advice and consent. Once the science on this issue has evolved, we will then be able to base our laws on the science and avoid the costly mistake of basing the science on the laws.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last year, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously passed an amendment I sponsored to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act that requires incoming immigrants to be immunized before they enter the United States. 
The amendment makes public health sense. Between 800,000 and 1 million individuals emigrate from their home country to the United States every year. And, the Department of Health and Human Services has made immunization of the U.S. population against vaccine-preventable diseases one of its top health priorities. But before the passage of last year's Immigration Act, there was no Federal policy with regard to the immunization of foreign nationals seeking permanent residency in the United States. With passage of the Immigration Reform Act, we can be assured that incoming immigrants will be immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases. 
There are special circumstances, however, when requiring an immigrant to be immunized in his or her home country before traveling to the United States doesn't make sense. The law allows the Attorney General the authority to waive the immunization requirement whenever the requirement `would not be medically appropriate' or when such immunizations `would be contrary to the alien's religious or moral convictions.' 
So, the Attorney General has complete authority to waive the immunization requirement. Some House and Senate offices, however, including mine, have heard from representatives of the international adoption community about the difficulties this requirement has caused for such parents and their children. 
To address this issue, Senator McCain and I offer this amendment to instruct the Attorney General `to exercise the waiver authority provided for in subsection (g)(2)(B) for any alien applying for an IR3 or IR4 category visa.' That is, for any orphan in another country who is to be adopted by a U.S. citizen. 
I have heard from adoptive parents and agencies in Arizona about the unique difficulties the immunization requirement is creating for some adoptive parents and their babies and young children. Their unique concerns focus on a number of issues, including: 
Unavailable background Records: Children from orphanages, which comprise over 50 percent of international adoptions, often do not have health records on which to base recommendations for vaccinations. 
Immunocompromised children: According to medical professionals, many children who have lived in orphanages exhibit significant immune defects. These immunocompromised children should not receive certain immunizations. Requiring such immunizations could cause the child to acquire the very disease the immunization is supposed to prevent. 
The exact age of the child is unknown and, therefore, some children could be forced to receive age-inappropriate immunizations. 
The adoptive parents often have limited time and resources to travel to the adoptee's home country. Forcing the child to undergo as many as five immunizations at one time, in order to reduce the amount of time and money a parent must spend in the child's home country, will drive up the cost of the adoption. 
There is a danger that unsterile or reconstituted needles, or substandard immunizations, may be used to vaccinate children in some orphanages in some countries. 
It is also important to ensure that any immigrant who has received a waiver be immunized once he or she has arrived in the United States. The McCain/Kyl amendment requires the Attorney General and Secretaries of HHS and State to report back in 6 months on how to establish an enforcement program to ensure that immigrants who receive waivers be immunized once they arrive in the United States. The enforcement program would not apply to immunizations that would not be medically appropriate in the foreign country or the United States or would be contrary to the alien's religious or moral convictions. 
On July 22, 23 of my colleagues, including Senators Abraham, Kennedy, Allard, Ashcroft, Coats, Conrad, Craig, D'Amato, DeWine, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Frist, Grassley, Hutchinson, Inouye, Kohl, Landrieu, McCain, Moynihan, Robb, Gordon Smith, and Snowe joined me in sending a letter to Attorney General Reno urging her to generously use her authority to provide waivers from the immunization requirement for these babies and children awaiting adoption. I am pleased that the Senate has adopted this timely amendment.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
As I said, this provision in the bill to divide the ninth circuit is very important to the State of Arizona because Arizona is the second largest State in the existing ninth circuit, both in terms of population and caseload. It, California, and Nevada are all three very fast growing. And there is no question that the caseload will continue to grow at least in proportion to the population. 
Phoenix, AZ, is now the sixth largest city in the country. Arizona is, I believe, the fastest growing State in the country. So not only do we have a situation in which we are growing very rapidly, along with Nevada and California, but the proposed amendment would result in a division of the circuit which would affect my own State of Arizona. So I speak to that issue. 
Now, it is not my suggestion, Mr. President, that the circuit be divided. There is a division of opinion in Arizona on that that suggests that the bench and bar are split. I do not think there is a clear consensus in my State as to whether the circuit should be divided, but I think there is a pretty clear recognition that it will be. It will happen sooner or later. It is inevitable, as several of my colleagues have already pointed out here. There is no question, because of its size and other factors, the circuit is going to be divided one way or another. 
The question is how will it be divided? On that question I think we have to look at this question of size, population, growth, caseload growth, and so on. Because if, for example, you divided the circuit the way it calls for in the bill, the caseload division would be as follows: The circuit comprised of California and Nevada would have 63 percent of the cases, and the remainder of the circuit would have 37 percent of the cases. That is about a 2-to-1 division, showing just how big California is. Probably in terms of caseload, the sounder way to do it would be just to have California. It would still be about 60-40 in favor of California versus all of the rest of the States in the circuit. 
But I gather that the proponents of this have decided to accommodate States who have expressed a willingness, through their Senators, to be added to California or to remain with California, and that Nevada has done that, as a result of which, to accommodate Nevada, it has been put with California. 
Now, if Arizona were to be added to that circuit, as some people suggest--again, there is division of view on this--the caseload would be 73 percent for the Arizona, Nevada, California circuit; 27 percent for the rest of the circuit. Obviously, that is not a good division for the circuits. So I have had to consider it from both a perspective of my State and what makes sense how to approach this issue. It clearly does not make sense, from a caseload division, to divide the circuit in a way that would add the three fastest growing States--Arizona, Nevada and California--together. I think it is bad enough to add Nevada and California together, though I do not deny that Nevada has a right to be with California if they desire. But it will soon be unbalanced and soon be the largest circuit in the country. 
Mr. President, in the end, I conclude I will not oppose this proposal. I would like to add two comments to those that have been made by my colleagues. First, there has been a suggestion that this circuit would be gerrymandered. I do want to suggest that that is not true. It is not true politically. The division of Democrat and Republican nominees would be exactly the same with the new division as it would be under the existing circuit. So I do not think that anybody believes this is about gerrymandering in a political sense. The percentage of Democrats and Republicans would be the same. Moreover, it is not a geographical gerrymandering. It simply takes two of the States of the circuit and leaves the remaining circuit as it is. 
Again, I would prefer that Nevada remain with the rest of the circuit to have a more evenly balanced caseload. Nevada wants to go with California--fine. That creates the anomaly that Arizona is divided from the rest of the circuit. But in the day of air 
travel, I do not think that is a particularly difficult problem for us, particularly since the committee has seen fit to designate both Seattle and Phoenix administrative sites of the circuit. So you have both a northern and southern administrative site. I know in the existing ninth circuit, cases are argued in Phoenix, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and so on. Because of its size, you have to accommodate the travel needs of the parties, the litigants. So there is an accommodation to that. And it would exist in this new circuit as well. 
But at least the people in the new circuit would not have to travel to California. So it seems to me that, on balance, maybe the best of a difficult situation has been made. I should say, the best has been made of a difficult situation. That is how to make a division that results in a fairly even distribution of cases, No. 1, and that does not divide the State of California, which I objected to along with Senator Feinstein. So in the end, Mr. President, conceding that division is ultimately going to occur, it seems to me that this is a division that makes sense. Therefore I will not oppose it.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. I want to say, we discussed the allocation of judges before. The Senator is exactly correct. I totally agree with you there should be a fair allocation, meaning that it should be in rough proportion to the caseload, and the projected caseload, not just the existing caseload. Therefore, if that means that there should be a different division of the judges vis-a-vis the States in the new circuit, I would not only have no objection to that, but I would join the Senator from California in assuring that that is the case. 
This was not my proposal, as the Senator from California knows. But I would suspect that the proponents of this amendment would be very happy to ensure that that distribution of judges is made a part of the legislation. At least, I would work with the Senator from California to assure that that would be the case.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday I voted against H.R. 2158, the bill providing fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and various independent agencies. Funding provided by that measure totaled nearly $9 billion more than the comparable amount provided last year--about a 10-percent increase. 
It would be one thing if the increase were devoted to improved services for our Nation's veterans. After all, they put their lives on the line in defense of our country and all of the rights and liberties we enjoy. We owe them a debt of gratitude--and the obligation to fulfill the promises our Nation made to them when they were called to serve. 
Yet the spending increase in this bill is not targeted to veterans. The VA sees only a 0.5 percent increase in its budget. Medical care is increased only 1 percent. But presumably, these increases were sufficient to fulfill our obligations to veterans, exceeding President Clinton's request by nearly $93 million. I support them, and I stand ready to do more if that is necessary. 
Mr. President, compare the virtual spending freeze that our Nation's veteran population is able to bear with what happens to HUD's budget. Last year, HUD received a total of $16.3 billion. H.R. 2158 proposes to take that figure to $25.4 billion--a $9 billion increase. An increase of nearly 56 percent. That is a huge increase, even by Washington standards. 
Now I know that part of the reason for the added funding is the need to renew expiring section 8 housing contracts. But I believe we have a responsibility to try to offset the extra spending with reductions in lower priority HUD programs, rather than just add to the total. I see little evidence of attempting to prioritize HUD and other programs in this bill. 
It seems to me that the opportunity to find offsets was certainly there. The AmeriCorps Program, for example, was funded at $405 million. Remember, this is a program that pays volunteers to work. In most parts of the country, paying someone to work constitutes employment. Volunteers provide their time and energy out of their own good will. But here we have a government program--a Clinton administration priority--that actually pays volunteers to work. 
AmeriCorps committed last year to try to reduce its cost per participant to $17,000 this year and to $15,000 in 1999. Yet that is how much a lot of people around the country earn from their jobs. This is an unnecessary expenditure of taxpayer funds, and we would do well to eliminate it. Yet I know that President Clinton would probably veto the bill--veterans funding and all--just to preserve it. So there seems to be little incentive to do the right thing and trim expenditures. 
The Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program is another case in point. The bill provides $1.4 billion for the program, with funding earmarked for a variety of projects, including library expansion in West Virginia, the Paramount Theater in Vermont, the Bushnell Theater in Connecticut, and economic development in downtown Ogden, Utah, to name just a few. If we had to set priorities, just like any family back home, we would probably conclude that section 8 renewals might be a little more important than some of these CDBG grants. 
But when the sky is the limit, we do not have to prioritize. We simply add more spending on top of everything else. And that is how we get a deficit problem. 
Mr. President, we need a new way of conducting business. We need to get back to a politics of principle, and of being honest with the American people about whether we are serious about seeking more responsible use of hard-earned tax dollars and reducing the deficit. This bill represents the old way of doing things, and exemplifies the politics of pork. 
I voted against the budget agreement last month, in large part because it allowed too much new spending. And the HUD and independent agencies portion of this bill is evidence of what we can expect as the agreement is fully implemented. That is why next year's budget deficit is projected to rise--and not fall --as a result of the agreement. 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that we do not have an opportunity to consider the various components of this bill on their own merits--veterans, HUD, EPA, NASA, AmeriCorps, and the like. I would have supported the veterans budget, the NASA budget, and environmental spending in the bill. But as a package, with the very large increase in HUD spending and a lack of sufficient offsets for it, I concluded that it was necessary to register concern about the process and our country's future, and to vote `no' on the bill.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the confidence of the American people in the American political system, in our Government here in Washington has been eroding in recent months, a subject that numerous pollsters and pundits have been writing about. One of the reasons that I believe this exists is that they believe people in high places can get away with things and they are, in effect, above the law, unlike the average American citizen, and that neither the Congress nor the administration has the ability, under that circumstance, to adequately track down perpetrators of crimes and pursue them to appropriate conclusion. 
One of the aspects of this that is most troubling to me right now has to do with the Justice Department's purported investigation of people and events surrounding various contributions, allegedly illegal contributions, to the Democratic National Committee, to the Presidential and Vice Presidential campaigns. Attorney General Reno has, after numerous requests, steadfastly refused to appoint an independent counsel to look into these matters, and I had literally hundreds of requests from constituents to make the point to Attorney General Reno that they think this is wrong, or questions asked by constituents as to how this could be when there is such an obvious conflict of interest, at least to the average American citizen. 
As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I joined in an effort with other members of the committee to follow a statutory procedure of writing to the Attorney General, asking her to either appoint an independent counsel or explain to us the reasons why she could not do so. She refused to make the appointment and gave her reasons. At the time, I thought they were relatively unconvincing. But since that time, irrespective of whether it has been appropriate up to now, Mr. President, a couple of events have occurred that I think has made it crystal clear that the time has come for the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel, because the integrity of her office is literally in question as a result of actions taken in connection with the Congress' investigation of these same matters. 
In June, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee announced its intention to grant immunity to 18 witnesses. They are very low-level witnesses against whom no prosecution is believed ever to be pursued or will be pursued. They were the straw donors who contributed money to the Democratic National Committee and were reimbursed by others, including one Charlie Trie, who apparently has fled the country and is currently hiding in China. Charlie Trie is a very close friend and fundraiser for President Clinton, who appointed Trie to membership on a governmental commission on U.S. Pacific trade and investment policy. 
Fifteen of these eighteen witnesses that the Governmental Affairs Committee wanted to grant immunity to were Buddhist clerics who have taken vows of poverty and yet contributed funds to the Democratic National Committee at fundraisers in substantial amounts. 
One was a Buddhist fundraiser in Los Angeles attended by Vice President Gore, who, of course, is a covered person under the independent counsel law; in other words, one of the people with whom there may be a conflict of interest as a result of which the Attorney General is supposed to appoint an independent counsel. 
Since June, the committee has announced its intention to immunize two additional witnesses in connection with these Buddhist fundraisers. Most of the 17 Buddhist witnesses have had immunity requests pending with the Justice Department since March of this year, and yet the Justice Department has not been able to visit with these people--most of them--or to take proffers of evidence from them or declare them for immunity for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. 
The Justice Department's policy on this is clear. Their policy is not to prosecute low-level people such as this, low-level straw donors or conduits who merely launder campaign contributions at the requests of others. So the Justice Department should have had no problem in quickly clearing immunity for these witnesses, the 18 original witnesses and the 2 additional ones. 
On Wednesday, June 11, the day before the markup at which the committee was to vote on this immunity request, both the minority and the majority counsel on the committee spoke with Justice Department officials who were conducting this probe, and 
these officials expressed no objection to granting immunity for 17 of the 18 witnesses. But the next morning, June 12, the New York Times had a front-page story declaring that Vice President Gore had knowledge about this temple fundraiser. 
Just a little bit later that morning, at about 10:30, the Senate minority leader held a press briefing in which he said all of the minority members on the committee would oppose the granting of immunity during the markup later in the day. Of course, since it takes two-thirds of the committee to grant immunity, without some Democratic support, at least two Democrats on the committee, the Republican majority would never be able to get immunity for a witness. 
Shortly after the minority leader made his statement, the committee minority counsel informed the majority counsel that he, the minority counsel, had spoken with the Justice Department and it now objected to immunizing 15 Buddhist clerics. You had a direct connection here between the minority counsel on the committee and the Justice Department as a result of which the Justice Department flip-flopped.

Mr. KYL. Well, Mr. President, if I can say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, there is an old Latin phrase that is used in law, `post hoc, ergo propter hoc,' meaning `after this, therefore because of this.' 
It seems fairly obvious that if, on June 11, the Justice Department has no objection to granting of immunity, and then there is a big headline in the newspaper on the following morning, and immediately after that the minority leader announces that all of the Democrats will oppose immunity--now, there obviously had to be some kind of a meeting at which this was discussed or he could not have confidently spoken of how the minority members would react--and then a minority counsel talks to the Justice Department and announces that their position has been changed, the only conclusion that one, I think, can legitimately draw from this is that the intervening events caused the change of policy at the Justice Department. If that is true--and, of course, none of us know whether it is true--but if that is true, that clearly injects politics into this investigation in a way which makes it crystal clear that the Attorney General does not have the credibility to continue the investigation of this matter and must appoint an independent counsel. The law requires in a conflict of interest that that be done. 
What I am saying here this morning is that this chain of events clearly suggests that result. There is no other explanation that has been proffered. To the Senator from Pennsylvania, I say your questions are right on the mark in trying to get to the bottom of this entire matter. 
Mr. President, I know time is short. Might I ask how much of the remaining time I have?

Mr. KYL. Fine. Let me then continue with another aspect of this that is important. Again, just to summarize this, it is not at all uncommon in law enforcement in order to be able to make the case against the people who are masterminding a crime, for example, to get the little fish to talk. And the way you do that is to say, `We will not prosecute you if you will tell us under oath everything you know and that information is useful in our ability to make a case against the bigger fish.' That is the way it works in law enforcement. 
With respect to these Buddhist nuns and monks who have taken vows of poverty, it is clear that nobody wants to prosecute them. They were used. They were abused in this process. I don't think anybody thinks they were criminals or that they had criminal intent. But what is alleged to have occurred is that somebody brought a lot of money in and gave it to them and said, `Now, tomorrow, when the Vice President is here, we want you to write a check in this same amount to the Vice President or to his campaign.' That is called laundering money. 
The way you make the case against the people who were behind that is to get the people who were the conduits to talk. That is why the Governmental Affairs Committee wants to grant immunity to these people, to bring them forward so that the American people can see what has happened here, and the law enforcement people can get on with their job about getting these prosecutions completed. 
So far we hear nothing from the Justice Department. Mr. President, none of us want to jeopardize prosecutions, and when the Attorney General came before the Judiciary Committee, I accepted her explanation that, in effect, she was saying, `Trust me, we have professional investigators pursuing criminal prosecutions and we will do that to the appropriate end.' 
I can do nothing but trust the Attorney General when she makes that kind of statement, and none of us want to jeopardize prosecutions. But what I am saying this morning is that the chain of events now appears to be raising questions that are so serious that unless they are adequately publicly answered by the Attorney General, her credibility to continue this investigation on her own without the appointment of a special counsel is called into such serious question that I believe that the Senate of the United States could not adequately continue its public investigation and the American people would rightly question whether or not the administrative branch of Government, the embodiment of the Attorney General and the Justice Department, is not improperly involved in the investigation and hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee of the U.S. Senate. I think that conclusion is inevitable. 
It would be a shame for that conclusion to be reached, and, as a result, Mr. President, to clear it all up, to get to the bottom of everything and to avoid the conclusion that the Justice Department is improperly involving politics in this matter, once again, we call upon the Attorney General of the United States to call for the appointment of an independent counsel in these fundraising matters.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could respond then to the Senator from Pennsylvania, he is absolutely correct. There is a second event which again calls into question the objectivity of the Justice Department and I think requires us to add a second element to this request for the appointment of a special counsel. 
On July 11, Assistant Attorney General Andrew Fois, who is a political appointee running the Office of Legislative Affairs, and who frankly is very unlikely to have access to the classified information, the sensitive information on which Chairman Thompson based his opening statement about the influence of Chinese money in American Government on, this individual, this Assistant Attorney General, sent a letter asserting that the chairman's statement did not represent the views of the executive branch. 
Now, this is important for the following reason. Recall that when Chairman Thompson began the Governmental Affairs hearings, he announced that the committee had sensitive information implicating the Chinese Government for its efforts to involve itself illegally and improperly in American political campaigns. 
Some people in the media and in the minority questioned whether Chairman Thompson could legitimately make that claim. His response could only be that it had been cleared with the FBI, of the Department of Justice, and the CIA. He could not go any further because information was classified and highly sensitive. So he was in effect defenseless, Mr. President, to further explain his position. But he had to rely upon people's reliance upon his statements. 
Then comes this letter from the Justice Department casting doubt on Chairman Thompson's assertions saying, no, they had not cleared the content of his statement. That is the Department of Justice, that is supposed to be engaged in an independent investigation of these matters, clearly undercutting the chairman of the committee.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 agriculture spending bill that comes before us today totals $3.2 billion less than was spent on agriculture-related programs last year, and $12.6 billion less than was spent the prior year. That is an actual reduction in spending, from $63.3 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $50.7 billion this year--an astounding 20 percent cut. 
Mr. President, the savings are due in large part to the more market-oriented farm policies that Congress approved in 1996--policies that I supported. The Freedom to Farm Act did away with the decades-old policy of providing subsidies to farmers when market prices dropped. It did away with the policy of requiring farmers to plant the same crops every year and instead established a system of fixed, declining payments on the way to a farm policy free of Government intervention. 
The substantial savings in farm programs will allow us to target more funding to high-priority domestic programs, like the Women, Infants, and Children [WIC] nutrition program and the Food and Drug Administration's food safety initiative. WIC alone would receive an additional $121 million in the upcoming fiscal year. And without price supports and other subsidies to artificially boost the cost of food, every family's food budget will eventually go farther. WIC recipients will get more for their food dollar. Taxpayers will save. Every family will save. 
Given that spending is better prioritized, and given the substantial savings achieved in this bill, I intend to vote for it. Nevertheless, I believe we have the opportunity to do even better. Corporate welfare programs, like the Market Access Program, which subsidizes the advertising budgets of U.S. companies overseas, is still funded by this bill. It should be cut or eliminated. Spending on the tobacco, sugar, and peanut programs could also be reduced. These programs were largely preserved, notwithstanding other reforms in the 1996 farm bill. We ought to phase them out as well. 
There are a variety of special funding earmarks in this bill that could be the subject of the President's new line-item veto authority. The veto could be applied, for example, to almost all of the nearly 100 special research grants earmarked within the Cooperate State Research, Education, and Extension Service budget. The Committee report identifies grants totalling $47.5 million for such activities as maple research, alternative salmon products, goat research, and potato research, to name just a few. Most of these grants were not requested by the President. 
It may well be that some of these research activities have merit and should proceed, but I would ask why taxpayers should be obligated, particularly to fund those projects that specifically benefit targeted industries? More money could always be spent to find ways of enhancing productivity, improving flavor or appearance, or increasing resistance to disease or drought. It seems to me, however, that producers--whether they grow potatoes, blueberries, cranberries, or goats--have every reason and incentive to bear the costs of research that leads to better crops or improved sales. That is, after all, a fundamental cost of doing business. At the very least, we ought to ensure that such grants are awarded on a competitive basis after adequate peer review. 
Mr. President, there is similar earmarking in the Agricultural Research Service budget--set-asides for improving postharvest technologies for apples, for hops research, and the enhancement of peanut flavor quality. The list goes on and on. I would not be surprised if any of these projects was to be among the first that the President strikes with the line-item veto. 
Since a reduction of 20 percent in the overall budget should be recognized, I intend to support the bill. But I will also be inclined to support vetoes of some items in the legislation.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support an amendment I have offered to the national Defense authorization for fiscal year 1998 that sets conditions for continued United States assistance to Russia for the purpose of chemical weapons [CW] dismantlement and destruction. I offer this amendment because I am disturbed that--despite the fact that the United States has already provided $150 million in CW destruction aid to Russia through the Cooperative Threat Reduction [CTR] Program--we appear no closer today than when we started this endeavor to meeting our core objective of eliminating Russia's offensive chemical weapons capability. 
Instead, Russia has to date failed to demonstrate a commitment--either political or financial--to destroying its chemical weapons capability. Russia has not lived up to CW agreements it has signed. It has failed to implement obligations undertaken in the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA], which calls for United States verification of the destruction of Russian chemical stocks. And Russia is not working with us to resolve outstanding compliance issues associated with the 1989 bilateral Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding, which requires both sides to fully and accurately account for their respective chemical weapons stockpile. Moreover, Russian ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] remains a distant prospect, despite the fact that one of the principal arguments made in favor of United States ratification was that it would induce the Russians to do the same. 
In the meantime, Mr. President, as we continue to pour into Russia more and more chemical weapons destruction aid, the Russians continue to pour more and more rubles into developing ever more deadly chemical weapons. According to press reports, Russia has developed three new nerve agents made from chemicals--used for industrial and agricultural purposes--which are not covered by the CWC. This development program has been confirmed by a prominent Russian scientist who was jailed for revealing Moscow's continuation of covert chemical weapons production. In addition, Russia continues to modernize its strategic offensive forces. According to a recent Hoover Institution study, Russian spending on research and development for strategic weapons has increased sixfold in the last 3 years. They are developing an upgraded mobile ICBM; working on miniaturized nuclear warheads; building a new class of SLBM-carrying submarines; and constructing enormous underground command and control bunkers to protect against a nuclear attack by the United States. 
In light of these ongoing strategic and chemical modernization efforts, it is more than reasonable, Mr. President, to question seriously Russian claims that they do not have the financial wherewithal to destroy their chemical weapons stockpile. It seems to me that United States assistance to Russia for CW destruction has, in fact, had the perverse effect of underwriting Russia's offensive chemical program. Moreover, the practice of providing unconditioned funding reduces, if not eliminates, any incentive for Russia to set aside its own resources for matching United States funds. I would note that, while the United States has authorized $150 million for the purpose of destroying Russian chemical weapons and nearly half of that has been obligated, Russia has committed only $24 million for destruction of its own CW stocks, but has failed to obligate or spend any of this money. 
My proposed amendment conditions fiscal year 1998 United States assistance to Russia for CW destruction--totaling $55 million--to Russia's living up to existing agreements concerning destruction and dismantlement of its chemical weapons capability. The amendment closely parallels the approach taken in the fiscal year 1996 National Defense Authorization, when both Houses of Congress agreed to fence--but not cut--Nunn-Lugar funds for CW-related activities until the President certified certain conditions were met. It is also very similar to a provision contained in the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997, S. 495, which the Senate approved in April of this year. The intent is to reassure the Russians that--if they are serious about getting rid of their chemical weapons--we are fully prepared to offer them financial assistance to do so. However, the amendment is intended to make equally clear that the United States Congress does not intend for the American taxpayer to subsidize a continuing Russian offensive chemical weapons capability. 
Specifically, the amendment requires the President to certify that three conditions are met before Cooperative Threat Reduction funds for CW destruction may be released: 
First, that the Russians are making reasonable progress toward implementation of the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA]; 
Second, that the United States has made substantial progress toward resolution, to its satisfaction, of outstanding compliance issues related to the Wyoming MOU and BDA; and 
Third, that Russia has fully and accurately declared all information regarding its chemical weapons programs. 
If the President cannot certify that these conditions are met, the proposed amendment does provide an alternative for releasing funds. In such a case, the President must however certify that `the national security interests of the United States could be undermined' by not carrying out the CW destruction activities provided for in the CTR Program. 
Mr. President, it was my original hope to go beyond what we agreed in S. 495, and to send an even stronger message to the Russians that a mutually beneficial bilateral relationship requires both parties to demonstrate a firm commitment to live up to agreements already undertaken and to work together toward common goals. I am disturbed that, since enactment of S. 495, the CWC has entered into force without Russian participation, Russia has failed to renounce its offensive chemical warfare program, the Russian Duma has refused to allocate any new funds for CW destruction, and we have not reached any agreement under the CTR Program to cap our own contribution to this endeavor. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that this amendment sends a signal to the Russians and, if enacted into law, I encourage the President and senior administration officials to use this amendment for maximum leverage to induce the Russians to once and for all forswear a offensive chemical weapons capability.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment does. Then I will discuss it in further detail later. 
In summary, this amendment establishes five conditions for the assistance that is to be provided to Russia for destruction of its chemical weapons, the so-called Nunn-Lugar funding. Very briefly, this resolution is called for because the funding that we have provided to Russia to date does not appear to be adequately supported by the Government of Russia for its part of its own chemical weapons destruction program. If one could view this in the nature of matching funds, I think it is easy to understand. We have provided a great deal of money, of Nunn-Lugar funding, to Russia, much of it for destruction of their chemical weapons. They have not reciprocated by allocating or spending any of their own money for the destruction of their chemical weapons. 
In addition, they have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. They have not complied with the terms of the so-called Wyoming Memoranda, which is one of the methods by which we exchange information about our chemical stocks in furtherance of an agreement to destroy them. They have backed out of the bilateral destruction agreement, which was our bilateral agreement to destroy our mutual stocks of chemical weapons. They have not advanced a penny toward the development of the facilities for the destruction of their weapons that are currently being designed with U.S. Government money. In effect, they have not shown any willingness to join us in the destruction of those weapons which pose the most threat to the United States and other people around the world. 
As a result, partially in conformance with the terms of the chemical weapons treaty, which was earlier adopted, and in conformance with S. 495, which had other specific requirements, and consistent with requirements that the House of Representatives placed on the House-passed version of the defense authorization bill, we provide five specific requirements that the Russian Government will have to meet in order to receive this funding. 
First, that they show reasonable progress toward implementation of the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement; second, that resolution of outstanding compliance issues related to the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the BDA, that be resolved--at least that there be progress toward that; third, a full and accurate Russian accounting of its own CW program, as required by those previously mentioned agreements; fourth, Russian ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention; and, fifth, bilateral agreement to cap the United States CW destruction assistance and Russian commitment to pay for a portion of their part of their own CW destruction costs. 
As I said, these are reasonable requirements to be attached to U.S. taxpayer dollars going to the country of Russia for the destruction of their chemical weapons. I will discuss it in further detail later, but it seems to me to be more than reasonable for us to attach these conditions. If we do not, then additional taxpayer money is going to be sent to Russia with no indication whatsoever that Russia will ever support the program funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars to support their chemical weapons destruction program. 
Perhaps most important, the most that it appears right now that Russia is inclined to do is to destroy those old chemical weapons that pose an environmental concern to Russia with United States dollars at the same time that they are using Russian dollars to continue a covert development and production program of new chemical weapons. So it makes no sense for us to be spending U.S. taxpayer dollars to help them destroy the stocks of the old environmentally unsafe weapons that they would like to get rid of anyway, at the same time they are using their money to develop new chemical weapons and produce those new chemical weapons that could someday be used against the United States--all in violation of the chemical weapons treaty, I might add. 
So that is the nature of the first amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment--and this is really a very simple amendment that I think specific language will be worked out on with members of the committee and hopefully could be included as part of the managers' amendment--is simply to ensure that the President of the United States receives direct and objective and unencumbered advice regarding the safety and reliability and security of the U.S. nuclear force from the directors of the national laboratories and the members of the Nuclear Weapons Council. 
Just one bit of background here. Both the national laboratories and the Nuclear Weapons Council are supposed to give the President advice about the safety, reliability, and security of our nuclear force. For them to be able to do that in an objective way, they obviously need to tell it as it is, `tell it like it is,' without any fear that they are not adhering to any party line with respect to those issues. 
This, in effect, extends the Goldwater-Nichols-like protection that has previously been provided to members of the armed services, the Joint Chiefs, for example, to the lab directors and the members of the Nuclear Weapons Council so they can give the President unvarnished, objective, accurate information, and that information can also come to the Congress, all for the purpose of enabling us to set proper national policy with respect to our nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, I will have more to say about this later. As I said, I hope the amendment can be worked on and included as part of the managers' amendment. We will discuss this amendment further later. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, hard-working American families have not seen significant net tax relief since Ronald Reagan's first year in office as President. That was 16 years ago, in 1981. Since then, their tax burden has gone in just one direction--up. Higher payroll taxes, higher taxes on gasoline and Social Security, higher taxes on capital gains and air travel. If you manage to save something for your child's education, the earnings are even taxed. 
It is no wonder, then, that the typical American family feels overwhelmed: it now pays more in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and shelter combined. That is wrong, and it has got to change. It is about to change. 
Mr. President, there has really been a sea of change in Washington's approach to taxing in recent years. Remember that it was not so long ago, in 1993 to be exact, that President Clinton pushed through the largest tax increase in the Nation's history. Everyone in the country felt the bite of the Clinton gas-tax increase. Retirees even saw their Social Security benefits taxed more. The debate back then was not whether to raise taxes, but how much to raise them. 
Two years ago, after Republicans gained control of both Houses of Congress, the debate changed dramatically. The question no longer was whether to raise taxes, or even whether to cut taxes. The question was how much to cut them. The debate has changed so much that President Clinton, who initiated that record-setting tax increase 4 years ago, and who vetoed tax relief just 2 years ago, now tries to claim the tax-cutting mantra as his own. 
We began last year to make some incremental progress in offering tax relief. The adoption tax credit, for example, was enacted, as was an increase in the Social Security earnings limitation and new tax incentives for the purchase of long-term health insurance. That was after President Clinton vetoed a far more substantial tax-cut package in December 1995. 
The bill before us today takes yet another step in the right direction. When signed into law, it will provide more tax relief than any other bill in 16 years. And three-quarters of the total relief provided by the bill will go to families with annual income of less than $75,000. Again, that is families with income under $75,000 a year that would benefit most. 
Make no mistake, it provides nowhere near the level of relief that American families need. The net tax cut of between $77 billion and $85 billion over 5 years represents just 1 percent of the amount that the Treasury would otherwise collect over that period. But given the constraints on tax relief that President Clinton imposed in this year's budget agreement, it is probably the most we can do. It is, in my view, merely a downpayment on the amount of tax relief that we will continue to seek next year and the years after that. 
Mr. President, I opposed the budget agreement a few weeks ago, in large part because it so severely restricted the amount of tax relief that we could provide this year. I believed that we should have held out for a better deal for the taxpayers, but a majority of both Houses disagreed, and therefore we have to find a way to live within the constraints the deal imposed. I must say, however, that I believe the Finance Committee has done a good job with the 
limited resources it had to work with. 
The bill includes a $500-per-child tax credit for families with children under the age of 17. The credit would become fully effective next year; it would be limited this year to $250 for every child under the age of 13. 
The bill also provides important help to parents who are struggling to find a way to pay for their children's college education. It offers a new $1,500 HOPE tax credit, new tax-preferred Education Savings Accounts, and something that the budget agreement did not contemplate, a new deduction for student-loan interest payments. 
These provisions alone--the education-related and child tax credits--make up 82 percent of the tax relief provided by this bill--82 percent. An analysis by the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche estimates that a married couple with two children and a household income of $35,000 a year would see its tax bill slashed by 40 percent--to $1,573 a year, down from $2,625 now. If one child were in college, the tax relief would rise to 78 percent. 
The bill does some other good things as well. It reduces the capital-gains tax rate to 10 percent for individuals in the 15 percent income-tax bracket, and 20 percent for other taxpayers. It provides a capital-gains exclusion for homeowners--up to $250,000 for single taxpayers, $500,000 for married couples. Given that more than half of all taxpayers reporting capital gains have incomes under $50,000--including many seniors who depend upon income from their life-long investments to support them in their golden years--we can be sure that the benefits of these capital-gains reductions will flow to middle America. 
And with history as a guide, we know that the Treasury will benefit from a capital-gains tax cut as well. Between 1978 and 1985, for example, the top marginal tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost 45 percent--from 35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual capital-gains tax receipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 to $26.5 billion annually. 
When capital-gains tax rates are too high, people need only hold onto their assets to avoid the tax indefinitely. No sale, no tax. But that means less investment, fewer new businesses, and new jobs, and--as historical records show--far less revenue to the Treasury than if capital-gains taxes were set at a lower level. Just as the Target store down the street does not lose money on weekend sales--because volume more than makes up for lower prices--lower capital-gains tax rates can encourage more economic activity, and in turn, produce more revenue for the Government. 
With that in mind, many of us believe that the capital-gains tax rate should have been cut deeper--some wanted an earlier effective date, too--but the die was cast against more capital-gains relief when the budget agreement passed earlier this month. Still, even the modest reduction in this bill will begin to unlock the sizable amount of assets currently locked up in the economy because of high tax rates. The American Council for Capital Formation estimates that it will lead to the creation of as many as 150,000 new jobs a year. 
The bill also enhances the ability of individuals to save for retirement in IRA accounts. More Americans would be allowed to save in traditional IRA's, including homemakers who have been precluded from participating merely because their spouses are active participants in employer-sponsored plans. Non-deductible contributions of up to $2,000 to new IRA plus accounts would be allowed for anyone; distributions from the accounts would occur on a tax-free basis.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as he has done numerous times over the past 10 years, Senator Bumpers again attacked the hardrock mining industry in the United States. This time, he chose to introduce an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation Bill to repeal the percentage depletion allowance. This allowance has been in the tax code for over 60 years and repeal would be an arbitrary tax increase on the industry. 
Repeal of the allowance is a tax increase. Mining companies cannot recover higher costs, including higher taxes, by raising prices because mineral prices are set by international commodity market. It should be noted that the mining industry already pays high average federal tax rates--32 percent per a GAO study--because of the corporate alternative minimum tax. 
In addition to the damage that would be done by this arbitrary tax increase, I would emphasize that this is not the way to reform the mining law. Although Senator Bumpers and I may not agree on the specific reforms necessary, we do both agree that a comprehensive, responsible reform is necessary. Along with my other Western colleagues, I would like to see reform that is environmentally sound and allows industry to thrive in a healthy and supportive atmosphere. A one-shot tax increase on the Senate floor is neither comprehensive nor responsible. Any reform of such an economically significant domestic industry should be done through the committee process where all parties have a chance to be heard and the issues can be dealt with in a thoughtful and meaningful manner. 
I voted against the Bumpers amendment today and I am pleased that it was defeated.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention, this is amendment No. 468, designed to correct a technical corrections problem which ironically arose out of the Medicare Technical Act of 1994. 
To describe it, you have been going to your doctor for 50 years. He says you need something done. 
You say, `OK, do it.' 
He says, `Wait a minute, aren't you 65 years old now?' 
You say, `Yes.' 
And he says, `I am sorry, I cannot treat you anymore.' 
`Why not?' 
`Well, I don't treat Medicare patients.' 
`You do not have to submit the bill to Medicare. I will not submit the bill to Medicare. Let me pay you like I always have.' 
Sorry, HCFA says we cannot do that. 
Mr. President, this is very simple. It allows for those 9 percent of the physicians who do not treat Medicare patients to continue to treat their patients as they always have. Those parties do not make a claim to Medicare, Medicare does not pay it, they simply go ahead and pay the doctor like they always have. This is not what was intended in the 1994 act, but because of the way HCFA's regulations have interpreted it, we need to make this technical correction. 
I urge my colleagues to support the change.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise as the sponsor of the Senior Citizens Medicare Freedom to Contract Act. The act would provide a technical correction in the Medicare Technical Corrections Act of 1994 (42 USCS section 1395, et. seq.), which was signed into law in November 1995. 
The Medicare Technical Corrections Act of 1994 contained a subtle--and, based on the Congressional Record, clearly unintended--change in statutory language. 
The Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] interprets this change as expanding existing restrictions on private payments in Medicare cases in which claims are filed, to all cases involving Medicare enrolled individuals, regardless of whether a claim is filed. 
If HCFA imposes this interpretation through regulations reportedly now being drafted, HCFA would have the authority to completely prohibit Medicare enrolled who do not submit reimbursement claims to HCFA, and who do not have claims submitted on their behalf, and who are willing to pay their own bills in full--from paying non-Medicare physicians out of pocket for needed Medicare-covered services. 
Even without the regulations, the view of HCFA is clear.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for organizing this session this morning for us to talk about the importance of tax cuts and the activity that the Senate is about to engage in finally providing the tax cuts to the American people. 
Throughout my campaign in 1994, that was one of the central features of every meeting that I attended--people calling for 
tax cuts. I will get back to that in a moment. 
I was reminded, when the Senator from Nebraska was talking about being in North Platte, NE, this weekend and hearing from his constituents there, that I flew over North Platte, NE yesterday. That is what the pilot of the airplane said, and it reminded me that I had just been to a meeting in Colorado where people from all over the country were saying the same thing. Nebraska is my State of birth, and I literally flew right over the area where I was born. It does not matter whether you are from Kansas, Nebraska, or Wyoming, people around this country have galvanized around a couple of central thoughts these days, one of which is that the Government is taking too much of their money and they would like a little bit more freedom as to how they spend their own money. 
It is interesting that the announcement last week by the American Taxpayers Union, a group that identifies a day called Tax Freedom Day, the day that we finally begin working for ourselves and our families rather than the Government, that day has now been moved back. It was April 29 back when I entered the Congress. It is now May 9. What that means is that the average family has to work until May 9 to pay the Federal Government everything it owes, and after that it can begin paying the State governments and other governments and eventually begin working for itself. 
It is high time, Mr. President, that the Congress initiate the action and that the President support the action to reduce taxes for hard-working American families. I think we find that throughout the country, whatever State we are from, that is what our constituents are telling us. 
Now, we had tax cuts in 1981 and in 1986, but we had big tax increases in 1990 and 1993. Those two tax increases were ostensibly for the purpose of balancing the Federal budget. What we found is that the tax increases did not help to balance the Federal budget at all. What has really helped to move us toward a balanced budget are two things. One, a robust economy producing wealth, producing jobs, and producing revenues to the Treasury, and also a Congress that has been more willing to hold the line on spending. Through a combination of those two things we can achieve a balanced budget, and that is what the budget agreement was all about. 
Unfortunately, we are not spending enough of that revenue generated by a robust economy on the tax relief that should be provided to American families. As a result, the budget agreement only provides for $85 billion over a period of 5 years in tax relief to American families, not nearly enough to do the job we should be doing. That represents about 1 percent of the $8.6 trillion that will be coming into the Federal Treasury during this 5-year period. So, clearly, we could use more of the increase in revenues to offset the tax burden on the American family. 
But at least the negotiators who put this together in the Finance Committee, which has put together a good package of tax relief for American families, has recognized that a thriving economy is one of the keys to not only continued economic growth but also getting rid of the deficit, that the economy producing wealth also translates in revenues to the Treasury that will enable us to achieve a balanced budget. What they have also recognized is it will enable us to provide tax relief. 
Now, there is another aspect of good news in this, Mr. President. Not only does a thriving economy bring in more revenue and therefore enable us to balance the budget and provide tax relief, but that very tax relief helps to fuel the economy to grow even more, produce even more jobs, produce even more wealth, and therefore more revenues to the Treasury. So, it is a very positive and constructive cycle--tax relief can assist the economy to continue to thrive to produce more wealth to produce more revenue to the Treasury. 
Therefore, we ought to consider that this is just the beginning of tax relief. For those of us who have been preaching this for a long time, I think we should at least get a little bit of credit for the theory that has resulted in the good situation that we are in right now, and that perhaps those who said no, the only way you can have a balanced budget is by raising taxes, will now acknowledge that those of us who have been proposing cutting taxes have had something to say for these last several years. 
The original budget agreement here that we are trying to implement calls for $85 billion in tax relief over a 5-year period. That is not enough to do everything that everyone would like. As a matter of fact, the original Republican plan called for a reduction in capital gains taxes, estate tax relief, $500 per child tax credit, and some educational and IRA benefits to American taxpayers. That would cost about $188 billion over the 5-year period if you do not count increased revenues that would be produced as a result of capital gains reductions. So you can see from a program that would theoretically cost the Treasury $188 billion, trying to squeeze all of that into $85 billion is going to mean that this tax relief is not as robust as we would like it to be, and that is a fact. 
But I do compliment the Finance Committee for making the 
most out of the $85 billion it was provided. I think, as we will see as this is debated on the floor this week, the benefits to the American taxpayers, as the Senator from Nebraska has pointed out, are significant. Most of them go to working families. There are some that go to the risk-takers in our society, but after all, if there is not some reward for risk-taking in our economy, people are not going to take risks, they will not make those investments that eventually produce the great companies that hire the people that produce the wealth and end up creating revenues for the Treasury. 
So it is a combination of providing most of the tax relief for American working families and, in addition to that, some reward for the risk-takers in our society. 
The American Council for Capital Formation has estimated that the capital gains relief that is provided for in our bill would reduce the cost of capital by at least 8 percent. What that would do is permit the creation of 150,000 new jobs each and every year. So that is one of the benefits of this capital gains reduction we are talking about, Mr. President. It is to enable capital to be more efficiently used in our economy. Instead of having $7 trillion in pent-up assets that nobody wants to sell or dispose of because they will have to pay a big tax on it of 28 percent, if we reduce that to 20 percent for higher bracket taxpayers and 10 percent for lower bracket taxpayers, that is an incentive for them to finally sell that asset that they have been holding on to, and by that sale we actually not only help to put the money into more productive enterprises but also eventually create more revenue to the Treasury as a result of the tax that is paid every time one of those assets sells. 
A lot of economists today will criticize the current capital gains policy because what it has done is to tie up capital in older industries, in businesses that were created a long time ago. People do not want to sell when they have to pay the capital gains tax on it and invest it in a more contemporary kind of business. But America has led the world in enterprise, in new businesses--in our high tech computer industry, for example--and if we are going to continue to maintain that lead, we need to have the capital to invest in these new and emerging industries. The only way that will be possible is if there is an incentive for people to get rid of the investment in the older industry or business and invest that in one of the new emerging businesses. 
Interestingly enough, this American Council for Capital Formation notes that the cost of capital would be reduced by 8 percent, which would create new jobs. It will also help the Treasury. It should be noted, between 1978 and 1985, the top margin of tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost 45 percent--it went from 35 percent down to 20 percent--but total individual capital gains receipts tripled, from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion annually. 
Obviously, a capital gains tax cut is a winner for investors, for job seekers, as well as for the U.S. Treasury. That is why we believe that the capital gains components of tax relief, as the Senator from Nebraska pointed out, has to be one of the critical components and will benefit all American families as well as the U.S. Treasury. 
We have talked about the other aspects of this tax proposal, my colleagues have, but I wanted to specifically single out the capital gains tax because it does not help just the wealthy, as some folks say, 
but will provide benefits to all taxpayers in this country and all workers. 
One last word, Mr. President. I have sponsored the bill to repeal the estate tax, or the so-called death tax. My bill has more cosponsors than any of the other bills relating to the estate tax in the Senate and, likewise, the corresponding bill in the House. The Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Kansas, and the Senator from Wyoming have all been very supportive because of the impact on farms and small businesses in their States. It is the same throughout the country. We need to do something about this. 
Unfortunately, because of the original budget agreement limiting the tax cuts to only $85 billion over the 5-year period, or 1 percent of tax revenues, the administration made sure that there wasn't too much tax relief in the agreement. The Senate leaders were trying to push for more, but because there was an agreement we are not going to be able to do everything we should. All we are going to be able to do on estate tax relief is very, very modest relief. I regret that. All of us do. 
Basically, what we are doing is raising the exemption from $600,000 up to a million dollars over a 10- or 11-year period. Inflation alone will mean that not even this legislation will keep pace with inflation. So that is totally inadequate. In order for us to do what we do in the other areas, I guess we are going to have to be willing to accept that. What it means, Mr. President, is that there is still going to be a big incentive for those people concerned about the estate tax to come in with a second round of reforms, beginning next year. 
As a result of an amendment I was able to get passed in the budget, and which stayed in the budget, we are not precluded from offering additional tax relief beginning next year. One of the first things I am going to do--and I think my colleagues will support me on this--is get additional estate tax relief beyond that which is agreed to in this bill. We all recognize that it is totally inadequate in this bill. We support the tax relief, but we don't, for a minute, contend that it is adequate. 
So those are the two points I wanted to make--first, that the capital gains relief in this legislation will be enormously beneficial to working families, to the risk-takers in our society, and even to the Treasury, which will enable us to continue to be on a track to balance the Federal budget. 
Second, this whole package is just the beginning. We begin the process of reducing the tax burden on working Americans, but even beginning next year we will have proposals to continue that process. It is the right thing to do. It is what our constituents asked us to do, and for future generations it is the only thing we can do to fully comply with our obligation to leave this country a better place than we found it. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for the time.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to the Torricelli amendment. My grandmother used to say there are some things that are better not to know, and that is the case with certain highly classified information that is important to the national security of American citizens. One of those things is how much money is spent on our intelligence activities, information which is very useful to our opponents, and not particularly useful to the average American taxpayer. 
The public's right to know, as has been pointed out by the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is adequately protected by our elected representatives. That is why we have special provisions of law, Mr. President, that call for certain Members of Congress only--not every Member of Congress, but only certain Members of Congress--to be apprised of certain operations and certain details of our intelligence operations. 
For example, in an operation such as that which nabbed the terrorist Mir Aimal Kansi just last Saturday, it was known to only a handful of our elected representatives because that is what the law provides. The American people did not need to know that, and, indeed, it would have jeopardized American lives, the people who were involved in this operation, had there been more widespread knowledge. There is a reason why this information is not public. 
The irony is, Mr. President, that revealing the top-line number, the aggregate amount we spend on intelligence, would be of very little use to the average American debating whether or not it is the proper number, but it means a great deal to clever potential adversaries who do trend analysis and extrapolation from year to year to see whether or not there are changes and who try to determine whether or not we have, therefore, made certain commitments to our intelligence that would be of interest to. 
So on the one hand it doesn't help the average American much. On the other hand, it could easily help opponents a great deal. Unfortunately, there is no way for us to defend that budget. If the top line is $10 billion, or $100 billion, or $50 billion, just hypothetically, whatever number, somebody might say, `I don't think that is a good number.' How do you defend that number without getting into all of the sensitive, classified information that comprises the budget? So it is not a good idea. 
No other friend or ally of the United States reveals the amount that it spends on intelligence. It would set a terrible, terrible precedent, Mr. President, because right after the aggregate budget was revealed, everybody would realize that, to the average American, that doesn't say much and so the calls would be very quick for more information. `You gave us the top line; how about the categories on which it is spent?" 
This is a slippery slope, Mr. President. Reveal the first number and it will be just a matter of minutes before there will be a call to reveal more information. As a matter of fact, our colleague from New Jersey, in effect, just did that by saying that `in the area of defense spending we have determined that we need complete access to information,' to use his quotation. And the defense budget is known. Yes, the defense budget is known, but there is still much about defense that is highly classified. That is the way it needs to be. 
Another argument of our friend from New Jersey is that there have been leaks and there is no reason to continue to withhold the information. Of course, the proper policy when there are leaks is to find them. They can be very damaging to our national security. The answer is not to, therefore, let all the information out. The object is to try to prevent those leaks from causing more harm. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, if this is such a good idea, one wonders why previous Presidents haven't done it. They have the authority and power to do it, and they have not done it because they know full well that it is not the right thing to do. I just suggest that it would be highly, highly dangerous to the national security interests of the United States, to the lives of Americans who literally put their lives on the line to work operations that are very dangerous that the public never hears about, because, obviously, they can't, or it would compromise the sources and methods by which we obtain information. It would be very dangerous to these people if our potential adversaries could soon begin to pick apart the budget and learn what kind of capabilities we have to use against them. 
I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that we vote against the Torricelli amendment and urge my colleagues, when we have that vote, to do so.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the recent Senate debate over the Chemical Weapons Convention, a great deal of discussion centered on the proper role of arms control agreements. I recommend the Washington Times op-ed by Sven Kraemer, who served as Director of Arms Control at the National Security Council during the Reagan administration to anyone interested in the subject. I ask that it be printed in the Record. 
The op-ed follows: 
From the Washington Times, May 11, 1997  
Illusory Game of Arms Control  
`They cry `peace,' but there is no peace.' Jeremiah's lament about the false prophets of peace applies tragically to the false prophets of arms control who won Senate ratification of the proposed Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) recently. They cry `arms control,' but there is no arms control. 
CWC supporters saw the CWC as an `arms control' talisman to ward off evil powers and `to ban forever the scourge of chemical weapons from the face of the globe.' They proclaimed it a global ban although the CWC is far from global in its list of banned chemical precursors and in the number of states likely to sign or to ratify it. They proclaimed it as `arms control' while admitting it cannot be effectively verified or enforced and it cannot stop, and even risks abetting, proliferation. 
Such false prophets and fatal flaws are tragically common to other `arms control' items on President Clinton's radical agenda headed for Senate review. These include proposed `bans' on nuclear testing, biological weapons, fissile materials and land mines, a START III `framework' that vitiates START II, and a Helsinki summit agreement setting new limits on missile defenses. They don't build foundations or bridges for arms control in the 21st century, but are more like bungee jumps. Counting on miracles, spectacle and concessions rather than effective measures to control and protect against arms, they miss both the opportunities and the obligations of serious arms control and responsible leadership. 
CWC supporters claimed years of political legitimacy for the CWC and declared that a `no' vote would destroy U.S. leadership, wrecking a long effort to establish high international arms control norms and placing the United States on the side of pariah states. But it is a `yes' vote that puts the United States on the side of pariahs. A `no' vote would have embarrassed a few officials, but would have marked a principled U.S. stand, supported by American public opinion, against a fatally flawed arms control approach that rewards pariahs and rogues, lowers already low arms control standards and seriously endangers our own security.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on some comments that my colleague from Colorado made. First, however, I should like to address a subject briefly which has relevance to one of the bills we will be taking up, if not today, then later this week, and that is the intelligence authorization bill. 
This is a bill which should not have a great deal of controversy surrounding it. It provides for the funding of the intelligence agencies of the United States and the substantive policy that governs our intelligence activities, but it is especially relevant and propitious, I think, that we take up that bill this week following the news accounts of the arrest and incarceration of a man whose name is Kanzi, ostensibly from Pakistan, who is the alleged perpetrator of a violent crime against employees of the CIA a few years ago here in the Washington, DC, area. 
The reason I bring this up now is to make two points. One, we frequently hear the stories when things go wrong in law enforcement and in particular in operations involving our intelligence agencies. We try to learn from those lessons, but there have been bitter experiences with which we have had to deal. What we do not hear so much about are the many, many successes that go unreported, frequently because they involve law enforcement or intelligence activities that simply cannot be disclosed publicly. They involve classified material, sources, and methods of collection of information which we simply cannot discuss or we would be compromising those sources and methods. 
So these stories are not told, and it is too bad because I think the American people, in order to support our law enforcement and intelligence agencies, need to appreciate the work that they do and the danger that they frequently face and the many times in which by their actions American lives are saved and yet we do not even know about it. 
In this case, the details will have to come out later. We have been briefed, and certainly there is a very fine story to be told here. But the details will have to come out later. What we can say at this point is that this will be found to be yet another example of where American law enforcement officials played a key role in bringing to justice a terrorist, a person who at least allegedly has committed a heinous crime and hopefully, as a result of that information coming out, we will be supportive of agencies such as the FBI, such as the CIA, the DIA, and the other agencies, some of which we will be discussing in the intelligence authorization bill a little bit later. 
The second point is that we will find, track down, take into our jurisdiction, and prosecute terrorists. They can run, but they cannot hide. And they should note that we do not rest until we bring these people to justice. If you look at the number of terrorist incidents over the last several years, in many, many cases we have found and we have gained jurisdiction over and in some cases already prosecuted the people who have perpetrated heinous crimes against society in general and frequently against Americans. We will continue to be successful in doing that and in protecting American people if we are able to adequately fund and provide proper policies to guide our law enforcement agencies. 
So when we take that bill up later, I hope that my colleagues will be supportive and the American people will appreciate the continued necessity of providing that kind of support. In the end it is what will preserve our democracy as well as peace around the world.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator Bennett, which urges the administration to enforce the Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act of 1992. 
There is wide agreement among leaders in the Congress and the administration that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction [WMD] and advanced conventional weapons is one of the key national security threats facing the United States today. In fact, in 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12938 declaring that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them constitutes `an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,' and that he had therefore decided to `declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.' The President reaffirmed this Executive order in 1995 and 1996. 
But despite declaring a national emergency, the administration has been unwilling to take actions which would reduce the threat we face, such as enforcement of the nonproliferation laws passed by the Congress and signed by the President. For example, the administration has refused to invoke sanctions on China for the transfer of advanced C-802 antiship cruise missiles to Iran as required by the Gore-McCain Nonproliferation Act of 1992. This act requires the United States to impose sanctions on any entity that transfers `goods or technology so as to contribute knowingly and materially to the efforts by Iran or Iraq (or any agency or instrumentality of either such country) to acquire chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or to acquire destabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons.' 
The administration's failure to invoke sanctions as required by law is particularly disappointing in light of the statement then-Senator Al Gore made on the Senate floor on October 17, 1991, about the need for strong actions to combat proliferation. Mr. Gore urged governments around the world to make sales of sensitive technologies `high crimes under each country's legal system; to devote the resources necessary to find those who have violated those laws or who are conspiring to violate them, and to punish the violators so heavily as to guarantee the personal ruin of those who are responsible, and to easily threaten the destruction of any enterprise so engaged.' 
In 1996, China sold C-802 antiship cruise missiles and fast-attack patrol boats to Tehran. The C-802 has a range of 120 km with a 165 kg warhead and is especially lethal due to its `over-the-horizon' capability. In an interview last year, Vice Adm. Scott Redd, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet expressed concern that the C-802 gave the Iranian military increased firepower and represented a new dimension to the threat faced by the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf. 
On April 10, 1997, former U.S. Ambassador to China, James Lilley, testified to the Senate that Iran planned to increase the survivability and mobility of its force of C-802's, by mounting some of the missiles on trucks, which could use numerous caves along the gulf coast for concealment. And just this morning, Secretary of Defense Cohen announced that Iran had successfully tested an air-launched version of the missile earlier this month. 
Yet despite these facts, the administration has narrowly interpreted its legal obligations and has not invoked sanctions on China for the sale of these missiles to Iran. The administration concedes that the missiles are advanced, but claims the sale was not destabilizing, thereby dodging the requirement to impose sanctions. 
As we saw in 1987, when 37 sailors died from the impact of one missile on the U.S.S. Stark, cruise missiles like the C-802 pose a dangerous threat to U.S. forces and our allies in the gulf. The presence of the U.S. Navy in and around the Persian Gulf is critical to the fragile equilibrium of that region. Iran's possession of C-802 cruise missiles threatens this equilibrium and is clearly destabilizing. As Secretary Cohen said this morning, `Iran's word and action suggests that it wants to be able to intimidate neighbors and interrupt commerce in the Gulf.' 
Mr. President, the time has come for us to back up our words about the terrible threat we face from weapons of mass destruction and advanced conventional arms with actions. Actions that will reduce the threat we face by punishing those countries that supply these dangerous weapons to irresponsible regimes like the one in Iran. We should begin by enforcing the nonproliferation laws currently in place. The amendment sponsored by Senator Bennett is a meaningful step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to briefly address the same subject my colleague from Colorado addressed, and that is the proposition that Americans are finally going to get some tax relief. The biggest tax relief, as a matter of fact, in 16 years is about to be brought to the Senate floor for debate. It is uncertain yet precisely what some of the details are, but the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives has put a plan on the table, the Finance Committee in the Senate has put a plan on the table, and the members of that committee are working through the details of that bill. 
We do know the general outline so far, and I think we can talk about that and begin to lay the groundwork for debate in this Chamber on that historic tax cut for American working families. I think that is the first lesson to be learned here. I really deeply regret that some people at the White House are already beginning to take political pot shots at this very worthwhile, bipartisan tax relief to be provided to American families. It is the same old political rhetoric that it is a tax cut for the rich. That just does not fit this proposed tax cut. Most of the tax cuts are for average working families, and all of the tax cuts are good for the economy of this country. As a matter of fact, under the proposal that the Senate Finance Committee began considering yesterday, three-fourths of all of the tax relief goes to families making less than $75,000 a year and that is not an atypical, two-parent working family in America today. So with three-fourths of the benefits going to that income level, it is hardly to be characterized as a tax cut for the rich. 
As a matter of fact, 83 percent of this proposed tax relief is in the form of relief to families with children, the $500 per child tax credit and the educational tax credit and other relief for families struggling to send their kids to school; 83 percent of the relief is of those two components. 
So let us not begin this important debate with some political demagoguery about tax cuts for the rich, especially, Mr. President, since the relief here, though historic, is quite modest in total amount--less than 1 percent of the budget--because the negotiators, under pressure from the White House to keep the tax cut small, agreed to a net of only $85 billion in tax cuts over a 5-year period. 
Now, the Republican plan that was introduced at the beginning of this year provided for $188 billion in relief and, frankly, that was not enough for many of us who felt it should have gone further, but at least it was enough to provide meaningful relief in terms of the $500 per child tax credit, meaningful IRA relief, some capital gains relief, estate tax relief, and education relief. These are critical to the American economy and to American families. 
The $85 billion that is available to accommodate these five areas is not going to provide adequate relief in any of them but at least it will provide a start. I am a little disappointed in those who are already attacking it as if it is too much for us to afford. It was negotiated and agreed to by the White House. Therefore, I hope that we will get some support because here in this body there is already bipartisan support for it. 
It involves, as I said, a phased-in $500-per-child tax credit for families with kids. It involves two different kinds of IRA tax relief. There is the $2,000 homemaker IRA relief for families which do not have a pension for the homemaker. My wife always wondered why she could not fund an IRA the same way that I could fund an IRA. She worked just as hard as I did, even though she did not have a wage-paying job. And we also have a backloaded IRA relief provided in this package, so even in families where there is a pension, that doesn't preclude them from the spouse having an IRA and being able to save for future years. 
We also provide capital gains tax relief, not as much as we would like, but it ought to be enough to at least stimulate key parts of our economy so we can continue to grow and provide jobs for all Americans families. And, as I mentioned before, the educational component of this as well rounds out the relief. 
The one area where we did not get very much relief is in the death tax that my colleague from Colorado talked about. I think the answer there is simply this is not enough. Phasing in an exemption up to $1 million over an 11-year period is totally inadequate. But I think what this will do is simply sharpen our interest in continuing to engage in that debate and ensure that there will be greater relief from the death tax in future years. Obviously, it simply cannot all be accommodated within the $85 billion that was agreed to. 
So I think as we begin this debate we should do so on a positive note, on a constructive note, determining how we can work together to provide meaningful tax relief to American families. If we do that, we will succeed in helping the very people who need help in our society by ensuring continued economic growth and by making good on our promise to the American people for historic tax relief, the first in 16 years. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. Byrd addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
It is an honor to be a cosponsor of this resolution, as it was to be a cosponsor of the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act. The 1995 act declared that the holy city should remain `undivided' and be `recognized as the capital of the State of Israel.' 
Mr. President, for 3,000 years there has been a continuous Jewish presence in the city of Jerusalem. No other city on Earth is the capital of the same country, inhabited by the same people, speaking the same language and worshipping the same God, for a span of three centuries as has been the case with Jerusalem. 
In 1948, the Arab legion conquered East Jerusalem, including the Old City, as part of the general Arab military offensive to prevent Israel from coming into being. Israel retained control over West Jerusalem. It is important to note, Mr. President, that when East Jerusalem was under Arab or Muslim rule, it never served as a capital city for the rulers. Between 1948 and 1967, when East Jerusalem was under Jordanian control, Jordan's capital remained in Amman. I would also note that during this time, the holy city was closed to other religions. Jews were prevented from visiting their holy places, all the synagogues in the Old City were razed and Jewish burial places were desecrated. 
In 1967, as Egypt and Syria moved again toward war against Israel, the Israeli Government urged King Hussein of Jordan to sit out the fighting and promised that the territories he controlled would be left alone if he did so. The King failed to heed the warning. He attacked Israel, and in the ensuing fighting lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 
When the holy city was reunified after the war, Israel, under Labor Party leadership at the time, declared that Jerusalem will remain undivided forever as Israel's capital and that all people will have free access to their holy places. All people of all faiths are welcome to worship in the holy city. Former Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said it this way: `Jerusalem is closed politically and open religiously. This mean that it will remain unified, and only as Israel's capital, not two capitals. It will remain under Israeli sovereignty.' 
I agree with Shimon Peres. Jerusalem is, and should remain, a united city--the capital of Israel. I urge the immediate adoption of this resolution. As the 1995 act did before, Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 will send a principled and constructive signal to all the parties in the Arab-Israeli negotiations that the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to have my colleague, Senator Phil Gramm, join me as an original cosponsor of the Senior Citizens Income Tax Relief Act. This legislation would give seniors relief from the Clinton Social Security tax increase of 1993. 
The recently passed Federal budget deal provides target levels for new spending and for modest tax relief. As Congress begins to write the bills to implement this budget blueprint, attention turns to the details. One of them is whether there will be sufficient room for tax relief for senior citizens. 
Millions of America's senior citizens depend on Social Security as a critical part of their retirement income. Having paid into the program throughout their working lives, retirees count on the Government to meet its obligations under the Social Security contract. For many, the security provided by this supplemental pension plan is the difference between a happy and healthy retirement and one marked by uncertainty and apprehension, particularly for the vast majority of seniors on fixed incomes. 
As part of his massive 1993 tax hike, President Clinton imposed a tax increase on senior citizens, subjecting to taxation up to 85 percent of the Social Security received by seniors with annual incomes of over $34,000 and couples with over $44,000 in annual income. 
This represents a 70-percent increase in the marginal tax rate for these seniors. Factor in the Government's Social Security earnings limitation, and a senior's marginal tax rate can reach 88 percent--twice the rate paid by millionaires. 
An analysis of Government-provided figures on the 1993 Social Security tax increase finds that, by next year, America's seniors will have paid an extra $25 billion because of this tax hike, including $380 million from senior citizens in Arizona alone. 
Mr. President, I want to make an additional important point. Despite all the partisan demagoguery, the only attack on Social Security in recent years has come from the administration and the other party in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Not one Republican supported this tax increase on Social Security benefits. 
At the Clinton administration's insistence, the amount of tax relief we will be able to provide will be severely limited. It will be difficult, then, to repeal the Social Security tax increase. This is why I offered an amendment to ensure that we are able to expand tax relief in the future, and why the first tax relief proposal I am introducing will repeal President Clinton's 1993 Social Security tax increase.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say, as I did when this legislation originally came before the Senate a month ago, that I fully support the disaster relief that is being provided here. My heart goes not to the families that have lost their homes, their businesses, and their schools in the recent floods and snows. We have all seen the devastation on the evening news, in the newspapers. It is tragic, and we owe it to the people in the Midwest and elsewhere to put the full resources of the Federal Government behind the relief effort to help them get on their feet as soon as possible and restore some sense of normality to their lives. 
Mr. President, the relief in this bill is urgently needed. So are the provisions that would prevent another shutdown of the Federal Government this fall. It seems to me that we are taking the very responsible step of acting now to prevent another shutdown of the Government--something President Clinton says he, too, wants to prevent. Yet the President is threatening to veto the disaster relief, of all things, on account of the antishutdown provisions. 
Why would a President who says he opposes Government shutdowns threaten to veto a bill that would prevent Government shutdowns? 
I will tell you why. Recognizing how anxious Members of Congress were about being perceived as responsible for another Government shutdown last fall--recognizing that Congress would do just about anything to avoid another shutdown--the President was able to demand and win an additional $6.5 billion for his favorite programs. Majorities in the House and Senate went along. I did not. The threat of a shutdown proved to be a valuable part of the President's arsenal then, and it will be again unless we put a mechanism in place to keep the Government open while we continue to negotiate acceptable spending levels. 
There are other good things in this bill as well, including provisions to extend the expiration date of the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992, and to ratify the agreement between the tribe, Phelps Dodge Corp., and the Secretary of the Interior for long-term water use. 
Yet, Mr. President, I find myself in the position of having to vote against this bill for the very same reason I did when it first came before this body last month: it is yet another in a long line of spending bills that merely add to the deficit. It is business as usual, and it comes at a time when we supposedly have reached agreement on a plan to eliminate deficits by the year 2002. 
It would be one thing if there were no other way to get aid to the flood victims except to borrow. But it is quite another thing when we ignore other options in order to keep spending on other programs. 
The Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, offered an amendment that would have reduced spending across the board by a grand total of 1.9 percent. One point nine percent. That is less than 2 cents on the dollar in other programs to pay for this disaster relief and other spending. That is all it would have taken, yet there were only 38 of us in the Senate who voted for that amendment. 
Later today, we will be asked to vote on the so-called balanced budget agreement that our leadership struck with the White House. The ink on the budget agreement is not even 
dry. Yet the supplemental appropriations bill we are about to vote on would add $6.6 billion to the deficit over the next few years. It busts the budget agreement before the final vote is even taken. 
What does that say about the budget agreement, which does not even begin to reduce the deficit until the year 2001? Consider the deficits that are projected under that plan. The deficit this year is expected to total $67 billion. We are trying to get to a zero deficit--to balance--by the year 2002. But under the budget agreement, the deficit goes up, not down. It climbs 34 percent--to $90 billion next year--and then remains in that range for 2 more years. Only in the final 2 years of the 5-year plan--in 2001 and 2002--would the deficit drop dramatically. 
If anyone thinks that we are really going to be able to eliminate a $90 billion deficit in those final 2 years--when we cannot even find a way to pay for less than $7 billion in disaster relief in the bill before us today--they are mistaken. 
Mr. President, we all know that disasters can and will occur on a regular basis. Unfortunately, they will happen--floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and the like. We know it, and we should plan for it. 
The Appropriations Committee acknowledged in its own report that the number of major disaster declarations in the 1992-1996 period has increased 54 percent. In other words, we had ample warning that something would occur somewhere. 
Had we prepared for the need for disaster assistance last fall, instead of using every extra dollar to meet President Clinton's demands for new spending, we would already have been able to respond to the emergency in the Midwest and elsewhere around the country. But by ignoring the potential for disasters last fall, we merely paved the way for adding to the deficit now when the need for relief takes precedence over budget concerns. 
Mr. President, this bill is more expensive than when it left the Senate a month ago. It is still not paid for. It busts the budget agreement that we will vote on this evening. We can and we must do better.

Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Senate once again has the opportunity to move beyond rhetoric and pass a bill that will really help working parents and their families. 
This afternoon's cloture motion represents the second time those of us who support the Family Friendly Workplace Act, S. 4, have worked to invoke cloture--to move this issue to a vote. And yet, the minority has blocked consideration of this measure despite S. 4's wide public support and bipartisan support here and in the House. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act will help working parents balance the demands of having a family and holding down a job. Working parents, particularly women, are looking for more flexibility in their schedules and more time with their children. In fact, according to a recent Labor Department report, `the number one issue women want to bring to the President's attention is the difficulty of balancing work and family obligations.' And, according to Lynn Hayes, author of `The Best Jobs in America for Parents,' when working parents are asked what they desire most in a job, a majority answer `flexibility in scheduling.' Similarly, according to a study commissioned a few years ago by Arizona's Salt River project of the Southwest region, a majority of parents with children under 13 are willing to trade salary increases for flexible time, leave, and dependent-care benefits. 
There are other studies showing that Americans want flexibility in the workplace. In a work/family study conducted by Johnson & Johnson, for example, the company expected a need for child care to surface. Instead, `the big issue that popped out was that of all the things that we would do as a corporation in support of parents, the biggest factor was that they wanted a flexible work schedule.' And Federal employees, who already have this flexibility, support it in large numbers. 
As the parent of two children and grandparent of four, I have seen first hand how difficult it can be to effectively balance work and family responsibilities today. Parents are working just as hard or harder than ever before just to make ends meet without gaining additional time or money for their families. That's because our tax laws take too much of working parents' hard-earned dollars. It is also because our outdated labor laws make it impossible for many employees to work together with their employers to develop schedules that better respond to the demands of work and family. 
The problem was highlighted in a recent Newsweek cover story on the problem parents and their children encounter when parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. In the article, Kevin Dwyer, assistant director of the National Association of School Psychologists, cites research showing that, when parents do not have enough time to spend with their children, it leads to kids being `more aggressive, more deviant and more oppositional.' 
That brings us back to why passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, is so important. S. 4 will give millions of working parents, and in particular an estimated 28.8 million women paid by the hour in the private sector, the flexibility to better juggle their responsibilities both as parents and employees. 
By updating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Family Friendly Workplace Act will allow hourly wage workers and their employees to develop flexible work schedules. Under the FLSA, hourly workers in the private sector are not allowed to develop flexible work arrangements with their employers, even though public sector employees and salaried private sector employees can. 
In fact, as noted, Federal employees have been allowed to participate in flexible scheduling programs since 1978. It has worked well, and fully three-quarters of these employees report more time for their families and higher morale. Eight out of ten Federal workers surveyed by the General Accounting Office are pleased with the flexible scheduling option and want the program continued. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act will extend such opportunities to the private sector by guaranteeing, upon agreement between employer and employee, specific flexible work options. 
First, it will allow hourly wage employees and their employers together to choose whether the employee will be compensated with time-and-a-half pay or, compensatory time-and-a-half time. Some families need additional income; some families need more 
time to juggle the demands of parenthood. Whereas current law provides many working parents with the opportunity only for extra pay, S. 4 provides a choice between increased pay or time. 
The Family Friendly Workplace Act also provides, if agreed to by both employer and employee, a way for employees to bank overtime hours (up to six weeks of paid time) so that, when needed, employees will have a way to take extended leave and still receive a paycheck. Allowing employees to bank overtime hours, and be paid for those hours, is preferable for most workers, since many employees cannot afford to take extended unpaid time off to take care of a sick child or other dependent. 
Moreover, under S. 4, at the end of the year, employers must cash out by paying the employee for the unused accumulated hours. The employee must also be able to cash out his or her accumulated leave within 30 days.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a great American and Senator, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. The occasion for this tribute is Strom Thurmond's remarkable achievement of becoming the longest serving Member of Congress in history, surpassing the record held by Carl Hayden of Arizona. 
This historical milestone gives each of us an opportunity to publicly applaud Senator Thurmond, but it is not the reason for our praise today. The reason I am pleased and honored to pay tribute to Senator Thurmond is that he is a great man and patriot who has served his State and his country faithfully in times of war and in times of peace. 
Senator Thurmond has had a remarkable life. When I reflect on some of the positions he has held in his career, including: attorney, superintendent of education, State senator, judge, Governor, Army officer, Presidential candidate, and U.S. Senator, I marvel at the skill, determination and dedication that was required to achieve each of these goals. Most men would be satisfied with just one of these many careers. Not Strom Thurmond. He was on a mission to serve the American people. That mission kept pushing him to strive higher and farther in his lifetime of public service. 
I came to know Strom Thurmond through my work on the defense committee in the House of Representatives. I know Senator Thurmond is a very capable legislator in many issue areas. I now serve with him on the Judiciary Committee, for example, and can attest that he is a most capable attorney. I also know that the people of South Carolina are enormously proud of him for all the good work he has done for their fine State. From my perspective, there is one area in which I believe Senator Thurmond has stood out and has made the greatest contribution-- as an active member of the Armed Services Committee. 
Strom Thurmond deeply loves his country. This is apparent in even little things such as the American flag lapel pin he often wears. Or in vivid examples like volunteering for service in World War II when he was in his forties. Today, Senator Thurmond demonstrates his strong affection for America and the men and women in uniform by having the courage to take unpopular positions to protect the defense budget and to ensure adequate training and equipment for the Armed Forces. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee he has presided over tumultuous times in the military. The end of the cold war and the social reengineering of the military have made it a challenge to preserve military readiness. But, Senator Thurmond has tried. He deserves much of the credit for preventing our Armed Forces from becoming a hollow Army. As Adlai Stevenson once said, he did this `Not [through] a short and frenzied outburst of emotion, but with the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.' 
Upon his retirement, Carl Hayden said `I have always dreamed of power and the good I could do.' Strom Thurmond, I believe, has the same motivation. He has not wanted material things or glory, but has simply done the best he could to help those who needed help. Carl Hayden could not lose his longevity record to a finer man. 
I remember a recent visit to Senator Thurmond's office where I was greeted by an impressive gallery of presidential pictures, beginning with Franklin Roosevelt. He told me that these pictures are of Presidents with whom he has served. It was then that I absorbed the magnitude of the impact of the Thurmond legacy on history. Strom Thurmond has been involved in every significant event that touched Congress or the Presidency in the second half of the 20th century. Very few people can say that, Mr President. 
Strom Thurmond was a good soldier and good citizen. His high standard of allegiance has enriched our national consciousness and has sustained a sense of purpose and patriotism all across America. I believe history will remember him not for his age or longevity in the Senate, but for his contributions to improve the well-being of his beloved America.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes today about the budget that passed the Senate a week-and-a-half ago--a budget that I opposed. In particular, I want to discuss what appears to have made it possible for congressional leaders and the White House to bridge their differences and produce a budget agreement that allegedly leads to balance by the year 2002. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that it was a projected $225 billion surge of revenue from a strong and growing economy--an extra $45 billion in each of the next 5 years--that helped bridge the gap. Without that additional revenue, which was identified by the Congressional Budget Office the night before the agreement was reached, no deal would have been possible. 
Of course, the negotiators did not reach balance by applying that revenue windfall to deficit reduction or tax relief, as you might expect. Most of it was used instead to accommodate higher levels of spending demanded by President Clinton and even some in Congress. In other words, balance would be achieved, but at a level of spending $45 billion higher per year than if all the additional revenue were applied to deficit reduction or tax relief alone. The fact that the budget deal enlarges Government is one reason why I voted against it. 
Still, the budget negotiators rightly identified a thriving economy as one of the keys to solving our Nation's chronic deficit problem. And unlike previous budget agreements, they looked to economic growth to provide the additional revenue, avoiding the trap of tax increases, which limit the economy's potential and, in turn, make it harder to eliminate the red ink. They even found a way to provide a limited amount of tax relief. 
But with the deal so dependent upon economic growth, and no significant changes in policy to prevent the already lengthy expansion from running its course within the next few years, many of us believe that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to ever realize the extra revenues that the budget agreement depends on to bring the budget into balance. 
As you know, Mr. President, the agreement itself provides no tax cuts--no family tax credit, capital gains relief, death-tax relief, or education tax credit. It merely establishes the overall size of the tax cut that Congress will begin writing in a few weeks. It permits a net tax cut of $85 billion over the next 5 years--a minuscule amount considering that the Treasury will collect an estimated $8.6 trillion over that time period. 
Considering that even the modest tax-cut package congressional leaders proposed earlier this year--a $500-per-child tax credit, a 50-percent cut in the capital-gains tax, estate-tax relief, and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts--will cost an estimated $188 billion, it is doubtful that Congress will be able to provide even that level of relief. It is more than twice the net tax cut allowed by the agreement. The limited amount of tax relief is another reason that I voted against the budget agreement. 
Rather than spread tax relief so thin that it does no one much good, some of us are now suggesting that we focus relief on just a few things that will do the most good for the economy overall--that is, on capital formation. After all, not one business can begin, not one company can expand, not one new job can be created, not one wage can be increased without the capital to start. 
With that in mind, the single best thing we could do would be to provide a deep 
reduction in the tax on capital gains. Ideally, the reduction should match that which was recommended by Democratic President John F. Kennedy as part of his economic growth plan in 1963--a 70-percent exclusion for gains earned by individuals, and an alternative tax rate of 22 percent for corporations. Ironically, President Kennedy's plan, which I introduced this year as the Capital Gains Reform Act, S. 72, proposed even deeper capital-gains cuts than the Republican Congress passed a year-and-a-half ago. 
Capital-gains reform will help employers and employees. The American Council for Capital Formation estimates that a Kennedy-like plan would reduce the cost of capital by at least 8 percent, leading to as many as 150,000 new jobs a year. 
It will also help the Treasury. Between 1978 and 1985, the top marginal tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost 45 percent--from 35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual capital gains tax receipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion annually. That may come as a surprise to some people, but the fact is that when tax rates are too high, people merely hold on to their assets to avoid the tax altogether. No sale, no tax. But that means less investment, fewer new businesses and new jobs, and--as historical records show--far less revenue to the Treasury than if capital-gains taxes were set at a lower level. 
Research by experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research actually indicates that the maximizing capital-gains tax rate--that is, the rate that would bring in the most revenue to the Treasury--is somewhere between nine and 21 percent. The Capital Gains Reform Act, by virtue of the 70 percent exclusion, would set an effective top rate on capital gains earned by individuals at about 12 percent. 
President Clinton recognized the importance of lessening the capital-gains tax burden by proposing to eliminate the tax on most gains earned on the sale of a home. That is a step in the right direction, but if a capital-gains tax cut is good for homeowners, it should be good for others who save and invest as well. I believe we ought to follow the Kennedy model and provide a permanent, broad-based capital-gains tax cut. 
Mr. President, estate-tax relief is the second item that should be accommodated within the limited amount of tax relief available under the budget agreement. I have proposed that such death taxes be repealed outright, as recommended by both the Clinton-sponsored White House Conference on Small Business in 1995 and the Kemp tax-reform commission in 1996. 
The respected liberal Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, recently observed that polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes. `The estate tax,' he went on to say, `is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings.' The estate or death tax thus discourages the very activity that is necessary to help our economy grow and prosper. 
The tax is particularly harmful to small businesses, including those owned by women and minorities. It is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business's operations. It should come as no surprise then that a 1993 study by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, CT consulting firm--found that 9 out of 10 family businesses that failed within 3 years of the principal owner's death attributed their companies' demise to trouble paying death taxes. 
In other words, instead of passing a hard-earned and successful business on to the next generation, many families have to sell the company in order to pay the death tax. The upward mobility of such families is stopped in its tracks. The proponents of this tax say they want to hinder concentrations of wealth. What the tax really hinders is new American success stories. 
The Heritage Foundation estimates that repeal will, over the next 9 years, spur $11 billion per year in extra output, lead to the creation of an average of 145,000 additional jobs, and increase personal income $8 billion a year over current projections. 
Mr. President, I know that my two bills--one providing a deep reduction in the capital gains tax, and the other eliminating death taxes--will probably not pass in their current form. The small amount of tax relief allowed by the budget agreement will not permit it if we are to provide child-tax credits, education credits, and other tax relief as well. But it is capital-gains and estate-tax reform that could help keep the economy on track, producing the revenues needed to bring the budget into balance. 
As President Kennedy put it, `An economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget, just as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.' Capital-gains and estate-tax relief should be at the top of the list when it comes time for Congress to write a tax bill in the coming weeks.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Gen. George S. Patton once said, `if everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.' 
Mr. President, I have no doubt that this budget is going to pass. There appears to be a lot of sentiment on both sides of the aisle that the deal must be approved even though it is flawed in many respects. But, like General Patton, I hope each of us and every American will actually evaluate the budget agreement on its merits before deciding whether or not to go along. I, for one, have concluded that the deal--on its merits--should not be supported, and there are several reasons why. 
First, consider the deficits that are projected under the budget agreement. The deficit this year is expected to total $67 billion. We are trying to get a zero deficit--to balance--by the year 2002. But under this budget, the deficit goes up, not down. It climbs 34 percent--to $90 billion next year--and then remains in that range for 2 more years. Only in the final 2 years of the 5-year plan--in 2001 and 2002--would the deficit drop dramatically. 
Think about that. We are at a $67 billion deficit now, and we are trying to get to balance in 5 years. This budget lets Congress and the President go on a spending binge for 3 years, and then requires us to eliminate a $90 billion deficit in just 2 years. It cannot be done. 
It is as if you decided to go on a diet and lose 20 pounds by the Fourth of July. But instead of losing the weight gradually, you decided to put on 10 more pounds and then started the diet in earnest on July 1. You would fail to achieve your goal. The same is the case regarding deficit reduction. If it is going to take 5 years to eliminate a $67 billion deficit, how can we possibly eliminate a $90 billion deficit in just 2 years? The answer is that we will not. 
Second, consider tax relief. Of course, the budget itself does not include a family tax credit, capital gains relief, relief from death taxes, on an education tax credit. It merely establishes the overall size of the tax cut that will be written later. But the amount of tax relief we will be able to provide is very small: a net total of $85 billion over 5 years--about 1 percent of the $8.6 trillion in tax revenue that will be collected over that time period. A tax cut of 1 percent. It is minuscule. 
It is going to be impossible to provide all of the tax cuts that we have promised within that small amount. 
Mr. President, the tax relief we promised to working families--to help small businesses create jobs and provide better wages--will total $188 billion alone. President Clinton's education credit will cost another $35 billion. And there are a variety of other tax cuts as well. 
What that means is that a single mother probably cannot count on a full $500-per-child tax credit. It probably will be something less, phased in over a period of time. And maybe only some parents will qualify. 
It means that small businesses, including those started by women and minorities, 
 cannot count on the tax relief that would enable them to expand, hire new people, pay better wages, and do the things necessary to become more competitive. 
It certainly will not be significant enough to prolong the economic expansion, which is already reaching historic lengths. That means the economy will probably slow, and people would be hurt be recession. We can prevent that by providing the economy with the shot in the arm that it needs to keep on growing. But that will require a larger, more meaningful tax cut. 
Third, consider whether or not this budget preserves Medicare for our seniors today and for those who will count on it in the future. Instead of going bankrupt in 2 years, this budget lets Medicare go bankrupt in less than 10 years. We need to make sure Medicare is safe and solvent for the long haul, particularly when the first wave of the Baby Boom generations begins to retire in 2010. This budget does nothing to protect Medicare for the next generation. 
It merely delays insolvency, mainly by reducing provider reimbursements, which will either diminish the quality of care provided to today's generation of older Americans or drive more doctors and hospitals out of the Medicare Program altogether, leaving seniors with limited health-care choices. 
It shifts the costs of home health care from part A to part B--a gimmick that we roundly denounced when the President proposed it before. 
Fourth, consider whether or not this budget makes good on the President's pledge that `the era of big government is over.' It does not. In fact, there are 13 new mandatory and entitlement programs in this agreement. And their costs will explode early in the next century. 
Fifth, and this may be the most telling of all, to pass this budget agreement we will first have to waive the discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 1998 that were established by the Democrat Congress and the Democrat President in 1993. Outlays will actually exceed the statutory cap by about $7 billion. In other words, the Republican majority, which was sent to Washington to try to curb spending, will allow spending to grow even more than the free-spending Congress of the early 1990's. 
Mr. President, this budget will not produce the intended results. It merely postpones all of the tough decisions until a new President and a new Congress are elected early in the next century. It is, as Yogi Beara once said, deja vu all over again--a remake of the 1990 and 1993 budget deals that simply yielded more spending, bigger government, and more taxes. 
I intend to vote `no.'

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest that before we begin thinking about patting ourselves on the back for the budget agreement that was finalized last week, we consider the hard work ahead. The agreement is merely a broad outline--a blueprint--for the spending and tax bills yet to come. We still need to consider how it is supposed to be implemented before claiming any sort of victory. 
We need to consider, for example, whether it will actually lead to a balanced budget by the year 2002. Is it good for families? Will it ensure that the Medicare Program is protected for today's generation of retirees and for our children and grandchildren? Will it help the economy produce the jobs needed for those trying to get off welfare, or those entering the work force for the first time? Will it help more young people get a college education? Will it provide the resources needed to safeguard our country from immediate and future threats from abroad? 
Mr. President, as the broad outline of the budget agreement with the White House has been filtering out over the last 2 weeks, I could not help but think of the budget deal that was brokered by President Bush and congressional Democrats 7 years ago. 
Here is what President Bush said when he announced that agreement in a broadcast on October 2, 1990: 
It is the biggest deficit-reduction agreement ever; half a trillion dollars. It's the toughest deficit-reduction package ever, with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed. And it has the largest spending savings ever, more than $300 billion. 
Of course, the agreement produced no such thing. Looking back, it produced bigger deficits, not smaller deficits--221 billion dollars' worth of red ink in 1990, rising to $290 billion in 1993. Federal spending increased from $1.2 to $1.4 trillion--up nearly 17 percent in just 3 years. So the mere fact that there is an agreement with the President is not reason enough to believe that the problem has been solved. As Gen. George S. Patton once said, `if everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.' We need to look objectively at the details, and whether the plan is reflective of values that our constituents sent us here to uphold. 
Right now, people are not sure. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll released on May 8 indicated that an overwhelming majority of Americans--roughly 8 in 10--do not believe the deal will actually result in a balanced budget by 2002. Obviously, we need to take a careful look at what is being proposed here before deciding whether or not to support it. 
Mr. President, let me quote some of the words President Clinton used on May 2 when he announced the latest budget agreement. I think they will show why people have reason to be skeptical. While suggesting that `it will be the first balanced budget in three decades,' the President went on to note that it would `continue to increase our investments,' `expand coverage,' `restore cuts,' `extend new benefits,' and `increase' spending, while `moderating excessive cuts.' My friends, we cannot balance the budget by increasing spending and funding a whole host of new programs and benefits. Let us be honest about that. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
As I recall, the goal in 1990, as it was again in 1997, was to devise a plan to balance the budget, while providing long-term Federal spending constraints and incentives for economic growth. I opposed the 1990 agreement, believing it was seriously flawed on all those counts, and I see similar problems looming in the latest agreement. 
Let me focus first on the issue of taxes. The deal with the Clinton White House is different from the 1990 plan in that it includes some very modest tax cuts. But because the amount of tax reductions President Clinton would agree to is so small--less than 2 percent of the revenue that the Federal Government expects to raise over the next 5 years--it remains to be seen whether there is any tax relief here worthy of the name. 
I know that some might ask why we even need a tax cut when the economy continues to grow at a relatively healthy clip. There are two reasons. First, think of families. A $500-per-child tax credit can make a world of difference to a mom and dad sitting around the kitchen table trying to find a way to pay for their daughter's education, to pay for summer camp or braces for the kids. What single mom could not use a $500-per-child credit to help make ends meet? 
Yes, the Federal Government could keep the money and try to provide some kind of aid to these families. But if families could keep more of their hard-earned money to do for themselves, we probably would not need government to do so many things. It seems to me that we ought to put our trust in families to do what is right by their own children. And unfortunately, it is not clear we can accommodate the full $500-per-child credit under this plan. 
What about tax relief for small businesses, including the new businesses started by women and minorities? After all, that is where most of the new jobs around the country are 
created. Provide a meaningful tax cut, and small businesses and family farms could expand, hire new people, pay better wages, and do the things necessary to become more competitive. 
Alternatively, Government can keep the taxes. But remember, it then turns around and provides a whole host of subsidies to businesses because they do not have the resources to do for themselves. 
It is an endless cycle. When people are not left with enough to care for themselves, the Government tries to do more. When it does more, it taxes more, and people are left with even less. It has to stop somewhere. Americans need some relief. 
Mr. President, it is also important to understand how important a healthy and growing economy is to balancing the budget. We just received word from the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] that this year's deficit is expected to decline to $70 billion. That is $55 billion less than President Clinton's budget assumed as recently as February. And it is largely the result of two things: robust economic growth during the last few months, and Congress finally beginning to restrain spending growth during the last 2 1/2 years. 
Limiting spending just takes some discipline, but how can tax policy help the economy to grow and prosper? It may come as a surprise to some, but lower tax rates not only help make people better off, but can produce more tax revenue for the Treasury as well. Just think what has happened during the last few months. The growing economy helped reduce the deficit $55 billion just since the President's February projections. CBO estimates that economic growth will produce an extra $45 billion a year for the next few years. So it is important to sustain that growth into the future. 
The economy grows like any prudent business enterprise grows. It is like a weekend sale at the Target store. When prices are slashed, people buy more goods, and the increased 
volume of sales more than makes up for the price reduction. The converse is also true--higher prices cause people to shop elsewhere. Higher taxes cause people to shelter income, or make less, to avoid paying more taxes. 
Mr. President, based upon what we know about the current agreement, it does not seem to me that we will be able to achieve either of these goals: providing families and small businesses with tax relief, or keeping the economy growing at a healthy rate. But what about spending? Does it do anything to constrain Federal spending--since it was excessive spending that caused the 1990 budget agreement to fail? 
Well, here is how domestic spending totes up compared to the levels Congress approved a year ago in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. These are figures developed by our colleague, Senator Phil Gramm, a member of the Budget Committee. And I will note that the Budget Committee will not begin marking up the budget resolution until this afternoon, so these numbers may change. But they suggest an alarming trend in any event. 
According to Senator Gramm's figures, domestic spending in this deal will amount to $193 billion more over 5 years than we were willing to approve just 1 year ago. It is $79 billion more than President Clinton himself asked for just a year ago, and $5 billion more than he asked for in February. 
Mr. President, the budget agreement with the White House would provide an additional $16 billion for new Government-provided health insurance, and another $18 billion to repeal parts of welfare reform and expand the Food Stamp Program. It puts more money into education, but because of the way this is done, the extra resources are likely to be eaten up by tuition increases. Or they will simply help those who had the means to go to college anyway. 
Medicare savings in the plan come largely from reductions in provider reimbursements, which either will diminish the quality of care provided to older Americans or drive more doctors and hospitals out of the Medicare Program altogether, leaving seniors with limited health-care choices. Medicare solvency occurs as a result of shifting the costs of home health care from part A to part B--a gimmick that we roundly denounced when the President proposed it before. 
The Medicare savings are enough to forestall the bankruptcy of the program for a few years, but they are not enough to ensure that Medicare remains safe and sound to take care of Americans in the baby-boom generation who will begin retiring within the next decade. The Medicare features of this agreement certainly will not protect the system for young people who are just entering the work force today. 
Defense spending in this agreement is also insufficient to protect future generations. We have cashed in on the much-heralded peace dividend so many times that our military service chiefs have been warning about increased risks due to budget cuts. 
I know that many believe this is a time when the United States can cut back its defense budget. But history teaches us the opposite. We have always enjoyed a period of calm before a storm. With the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction that is occurring today, and the emergence of movements hostile to the West, we do not have the luxury of waiting until after we have been threatened to invest in our military. We must remain ready and fully capable, both to deter and to defeat any aggression against American citizens. 
Mr. President, it is instructive that the first piece of legislation on the Senate floor after this deal was struck was the supplemental appropriations bill, which will add $6.6 billion to the deficit over the next few years. In other words, we have already added to the deficit 
before the ink on the budget agreement is even dry. 
We had the chance to change that with the amendment that Senator Gramm offered--an amendment which I supported. But it did not pass, and so for all practical purposes the budget agreement will have to be modified to account for this extra spending. At least that part of it will need to be fixed. 
I think we need to learn a lot more about the agreement this week before signing off on it. Unless parts of it can be modified down the line as the House and Senate begin writing the tax and spending bills to implement it, I believe it will not lead to balance. It will certainly not lead to balance after the $6.6 billion that was added to the deficit by the supplemental spending bill. 
Mr. President, it may even usher in a bigger, more powerful Federal Government, as happened in 1990. And that is not what many of us came here to do.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to announce for the information of the Senate and the public that the Subcommittee on Water and Power of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a hearing to receive testimony concerning several pending measures. The measures are:

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when President Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act a year ago, he said there are `rare and tragic situations that can occur in a woman's pregnancy in which, in a doctor's medical judgment, the use of this procedure may be necessary to save a woman's life or to protect her against serious injury to her health.' 
I do not doubt that the President made that statement about the rarity of the procedure and its utility, relying in good faith on information provided at the time by certain organizations involved in this debate. We now know, however, that the information given the President was of questionable value, if not downright inaccurate. 
A number of pro-abortion organizations, for example, had suggested that partial-birth abortions totaled only about 500 a year and that they were limited to very serious and tragic cases where there was no alternative. 
This is how the Planned Parenthood Federation of America characterized partial-birth abortion in a November 1, 1995, news release: `The procedure, dilation and extraction (D&X), is extremely rare and done only in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality.' Let me quote that again, done only--only--in cases when the woman's life is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal abnormality. 
The organization repeated this several times. In a press release issued on March 26, 1996, Planned Parenthood said, `The truth is that the D&X procedure is only used when the woman's life or health is in danger or in cases of extreme fetal anomaly.' The statement is absolute: the procedure is only used under these conditions, said the organization. 
In fairness, I will point out that Planned Parenthood was not the only group to make such sweeping statements at that time. 
Within the last few months, however, the story has started to unravel. On February 26, the New York Times reported that Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted he `lied in earlier statements when he said [partial-birth abortion] is rare and performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of women bearing severely malformed babies.' According to the Times, `He now says the procedure is performed far more often than his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy fetuses.' 
Mr. Fitzsimmons told American Medical News the same thing--that is, the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. He said, `The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.'

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Ron Fitzsimmons' admission is really not all that surprising. Even at the time of the debate in the Senate last year, the preponderance of evidence suggested that the procedure was more common than some of its defenders wanted the public and Congress to believe. Consider, for example, that Dr. Martin Haskell, who authored a paper on the subject for the National Abortion Federation, said in a 1993 interview 
with American Medical News, `in my particular case, probably 20 percent--of the instances of this procedure--are for genetic reasons. And the other 80 percent are purely elective.' He suggested at the time that an estimate of about 4,000 partial-birth abortions a year was probably accurate. 
Another doctor, Dr. James McMahon, who acknowledged that he performed at least 2,000 of the procedures, told American Medical News before he died that he used the method to perform elective abortions up to 26 weeks and nonelective abortions up to 40 weeks. His definition of `non-elective' was expansive, including `depression' as a maternal indication for the procedure. More than half of the partial-birth abortions he performed were on healthy babies. 
The Record of Bergen County, NJ published an investigative report on the issue last year and reported that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions are performed annually, far more than the 450 to 500 such abortions that the National Abortion Federation said were occurring across the entire country. 
According to the Record, doctors it interviewed said that only a `minuscule' number of these abortions are performed for medical reasons. 
Mr. President, evidence overwhelmingly indicates that partial-birth abortions are performed far more often than President Clinton suggested when he vetoed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act last year. But what about his comments about the need to protect the life and health of the mother? 
Here is what the former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop--a man who President Clinton singled out for praise as someone trying `to bring some sanity into the health policy of this country'--had to say on the subject. He said that `partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.' 
That is consistent with testimony that the Judiciary Committee received in late 1995 from other medical experts. Dr. Nancy Romer, a practicing ob-gyn from Ohio, testified that in her 13 years of experience, she never felt compelled to recommend this procedure to save a woman's life. `In fact,' she said, `if a woman has a serious, life threatening, medical condition this procedure has a significant disadvantage in that it takes three days.' 
Even Dr. Warren Hern, the author of the Nation's most widely used textbook on abortion standards and procedures, is quoted in the November 20, 1995 edition of American Medical News as saying that he would `dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.' He called it `potentially dangerous' to a woman to turn a fetus to a breech position, as occurs during a partial-birth abortion. 
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which, many will recall, supported the President's veto last year, was quoted by columnist Charles Krauthammer on March 14 as conceding that there are `no circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to save the life of the mother and preserve the health of the woman.' I would point out that, in the event that a doctor determined that a partial-birth abortion was the only procedure available to save a woman's life, he should or could proceed since the legislation includes a life-of-the-mother exception. 
Mr. President, I know that there are several other concerns that have been expressed about the legislation. For example, some have questioned its constitutionality, and that is a legitimate question. Of course, we all can speculate about how the U.S. Supreme Court might rule on the matter. But as Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Tribe noted in a 
November 6, 1995 letter to Senator Boxer, there are various reasons `why one cannot predict with confidence how the Supreme Court as currently composed would rule if confronted with [the bill].' He noted that the Court has not had any such law before it. And he noted that `although the Court did grapple in 1986 with the question of a State's power to put the health and survival of a viable fetus above the medical needs of the mother, it has never directly addressed a law quite like [the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act].' 
Mr. President, neither Roe versus Wade nor any subsequent Supreme Court case has ever held that taking the life of a child during the birth process is a constitutionally protected practice. In fact, the Court specifically noted in Roe that a Texas statute that--making killing a child during the birth process a felony--had not been challenged. That portion of the law is still on the books in Texas today. 
Remember what we are talking about here: `an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and completing the delivery.' That is the definition of a partial-birth abortion in the pending legislation. 
So we are talking about a child whose body, save for his or her head, has been delivered from the mother--that is, only the head remains inside. No matter what legal issues are involved, I hope no one will forget that we are talking about a live child who is already in the birth canal and indeed has been partially delivered. 
Even if the Court did somehow find that a partially delivered child is not constitutionally protected, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act could still be upheld under Roe and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania versus Casey. Under both Roe and Casey, the Government may prohibit abortion after viability, except when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. As I indicated earlier in my remarks, medical experts, including the former Surgeon General, Dr. C. Everett Koop, have said that this procedure is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. Others have even questioned its safety, calling it `potentially dangerous.' 
By contrast, in cases prior to viability, Casey allows regulation of abortion that is reasonably related to a legitimate State interest, unless the regulation places an `undue burden' on a woman's right to choose an abortion. But as I just indicated, the pending bill would only ban one type of procedure, involving the partial delivery of a child before it is killed. Other procedures would still be available if a woman's health were threatened. And the bill would allow a doctor to proceed with a partial-birth abortion if the woman's life were threatened. 
Mr. President, Notre Dame's Professor of Constitutional Law, Douglas W. Kmiec, made the point in testimony before the Judiciary Committee on November 17, 1995, that `even in Roe the Court explicitly rejected the argument that a woman `is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses' [410 U.S. at 153].' Professor Kmiec went on to note that under Casey, there is an elementary difference between banning all abortions and banning one procedure that medical testimony indicates is not at all necessary to save a mother's life. 
Mr. President, although I believe the law would be upheld by the Court, I will concede that no one can say with certainty how the Supreme Court will rule until it has ruled. Until then, I suggest that we not use that as an excuse to avoid doing what we believe is right. 
Mr. President, the other issue I want to address briefly before closing involves the question of when this procedure is performed. Some people, suggesting a way to compromise on the legislation, are now focusing on the third trimester, proposing that limitations on the procedure be restricted to that time period. Of course, all of the evidence suggests that the vast majority of partial-birth abortions--some 90 percent--occur during the second trimester of pregnancy. And as Ron Fitzsimmons put it, they are performed for the most part on healthy women and healthy babies. 
A third-trimester partial-birth abortion ban would be a hollow gesture at best, and at worst, a cynical hoax on an American public that is outraged at the barbarity of this procedure. 
It seems to me that a third-trimester limitation is merely a way for defenders of the status quo to make it appear that they are doing something to end this horrifying procedure without doing anything at all. 
Mr. President, the spotlight is on this body. The facts are on the table. Let us do what is right and put a stop to what our colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, has appropriately characterized as infanticide. Let us pass this bill.  
Exhibit I 
From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1997  
An Abortion Rights Advocate Says He Lied About Procedure  
Washington.--A prominent member of the abortion rights movement said today that he lied in earlier statements when he said a controversial form of late-term abortion is rare and performed primarily to save the lives or fertility of women bearing severely malformed babies. 
He now says the procedure is performed far more often than his colleagues have acknowledged, and on healthy women bearing healthy fetuses. 
Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he intentionally misled in previous remarks about the procedure, called intact dilation and evacuation by those who believe it should remain legal and `partial-birth abortion' by those who believe it should be outlawed, because he feared that the truth would damage the cause of abortion rights. 
But he is now convinced, he said, that the issue of whether the procedure remains legal, like the overall debate about abortion, must be based on the truth. 
In an article in American Medical News, to be published March 3, and an interview today, Mr. Fitzsimmons recalled the night in November 1995, when he appeared on `Nightline' on ABC and `lied through my teeth' when he said the procedure was used rarely and only on women whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged. 
`It made me physically ill,' Mr. Fitzsimmons said in an interview. `I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' 
Mr. Fitzsimmons said that after that interview he stayed on the sidelines of the debate for a while, but with growing unease. As much as he disagreed with the National Right to Life Committee and others who oppose abortion under any circumstances, he said he knew they were accurate when they said the procedure was common. 
In the procedure, a fetus is partly extracted from the birth canal, feel first, and the brain is then suctioned out. 
Last fall, Congress failed to override a Presidential veto of a law that would have banned the procedure, which abortion opponents insist borders on infanticide and some abortion rights advocates also believe should be outlawed as particularly gruesome. Polls have shown that such a ban has popular support. 
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, has suggested a compromise that would prohibit all third-trimester abortions, except in cases involving the `life of the mother and severe impairment of her health.' 
The Right to Life Committee and its allies have complained repeatedly that abortion-rights supporters have misled politicians, journalists and the general public about the frequency and the usual circumstances of the procedure. 
`The abortion lobby manufactures disinformation,' Douglas Johnson, the committee's legislative director, said today. He said Mr. Fitzsimmon's account would clarify the debate on this procedure, which is expected to be renewed in Congress. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons predicted today that the controversial procedure would be considered by the courts no matter what lawmakers decide. 
Last April, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have outlawed the controversial procedure. There were enough opponents in the House to override his veto but not in the Senate. In explaining the veto, Mr. Clinton echoed the argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons and his colleagues. 
`There are a few hundred women every year who have personally agonizing situations where their children are born or are about to be born with terrible deformities, which will cause them to die either just before, during or just after childbirth,' the President said. `And these women, among other things, cannot preserve the ability to have further children unless the enormity--the enormous size of the baby's head--is reduced before being extracted from their bodies.' A spokeswoman for Mr. Clinton said tonight that the White House knew nothing of Mr. Fitzsimmons's announcement and would not comment further. 
In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. `The abortion-rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else,' he said in the article in the Medical News, an American Medical Association publication. 
Mr. Fitzsimmons, whose Alexandria, Va., coalition represents about 200 independently owned clinics, said coalition members were being notified of his announcement. 
One of the facts of abortion, he said, is that women enter abortion clinics to kill their fetuses. `It is a form of killing,' he said. `You're ending a life.' 
And while he said that troubled him, Mr. Fitzsimmons said he continues to support this procedure and abortion rights in general.    
From the American Medical News, Mar. 3, 1997  
Medicine Adds to Debate on Late-term Abortion--Abortion Rights Leader Urges End to `Half Truths'  
Washington--Breaking ranks with his colleagues in the abortion rights movement, the leader of one prominent abortion provider group is calling for a more truthful debate in the ongoing battle over whether to ban a controversial late-term abortion procedure. 
In fact, Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he would rather not spend his political capital defending the procedure at all. There is precious little popular support for it, he says, and a federal ban would have almost no real-world impact on the physicians who perform late-term abortions or patients who seek them. 
`The pro-choice movement has lost a lot of credibility during this debate, not just with the general public, but with our pro-choice friends in Congress,' Fitzsimmons said. `Even the White House is now questioning the accuracy of some of the information given to it on this issue.' 
He cited prominent abortion rights supporters such as the Washington Post's Richard Cohen, who took the movement to task for providing inaccurate information on the procedure. Those pressing to ban the method call it `partial birth' abortion, while those who perform it refer to it as `intact' dilation and extraction (D&X) or dilation and evacuation (D&E). 
What abortion rights supporters failed to acknowledge, Fitzsimmons said, is that the vast majority of these abortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses and healthy mothers. `The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else,' he said. 
He knows it, he says, because when the bill to ban it came down the pike, he called around until he found doctors who did them. 
`I learned right away that this was being done for the most part in cases that did not involve those extreme circumstances,' he said. 
The National Abortion Federation's Vicki Saporta acknowledged that `the numbers are greater than we initially estimated.' 
As for the reasons, Saporta said, `Women have abortions pre-viability for reasons that they deem appropriate. And Congress should not be determining what are appropriate reasons in that period of time. Those decisions can only be made by women in consultation with their doctors.' 
BILL'S REINTRODUCTION EXPECTED 
Rep. Charles Canady (R. Fla.) is expected to reintroduce legislation this month to ban the procedure. 
Those supporting the bill, which was also introduced in the Senate, inevitably evoke winces by graphically describing the procedure, which usually involves the extraction of an intact fetus, feet first, through the birth canal, with all but the head delivered. The physician then forces a sharp instrument into the base of the skull and uses suction to remove the brain. The procedure is usually done in the 20- to 24-week range, though some providers do them at later gestations. 
Abortion rights activists tried to combat the images with those of their own, showing the faces and telling the stories of particularly vulnerable women who have had the procedure. They have consistently claimed it is done only when the woman's life is at risk or the fetus has a condition incompatible with life. And the numbers are small, they said, only 500 to 600 a year. 
Furthermore, they said, the fetus doesn't die violently from the trauma to the skull or the suctioning of the brain, but peacefully from the anesthesia given to the mother before the extraction even begins. 
The American Society of Anesthesiologists debunked the latter claim, calling it `entirely inaccurate.' And activists' claims about the numbers and reasons have been discredited by the very doctors who do the procedures. In published interviews with such newspapers as American Medical News, The Washington Post and The Record, a Bergen County, N.J., newspaper, doctors who use the technique acknowledged doing thousands of such procedures a year. They also said the majority are done on healthy fetuses and healthy women. 
The New Jersey paper reported last fall that physicians at one facility perform an estimated 3,000 abortions a year on fetuses between 20 and 24 weeks, of which at least half are by intact D&E. One of the doctors was quoted as saying, `we have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a minuscule amount. Most are Medicaid patients . . . and most are for elective, not medical reasons: people who didn't realize, or didn't care, how far along they were.'

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Article II of the Constitution gave the President and the Senate equal treaty making powers, stating that the President `shall have the power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.' Substantive changes to treaties also require the advice and consent of the Senate. John Jay made one of the most persuasive arguments about this point, noting that, `of course, treaties could be amended, but let us not forget that treaties are made not by only one of the contracting parties, but by both, and consequently that as the consent of both was essential to their formation at first, so must it ever afterwards be to alter . . . them.' 
Condition 9 of the resolution of ratification for the CFE Flank Agreement protects the Senate's constitutional role by requiring that any agreement to multilateralize the 1972 ABM Treaty be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, since any such agreement would substantively alter the rights and obligations of the United States and others under the treaty. This condition is not the first expression of the Senate's view on this issue, and would merely be the latest addition to a clear legislative history. 
Section 232 of the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995 clearly states that any agreement that substantively modifies the ABM treaty must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. 
The conference report accompanying the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act built on the language in the 1995 Authorization Act stating that, `the accord on ABM Treaty succession, tentatively agreed to by the administration would constitute a substantive change to the ABM Treaty, which may only be entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution.' 
The conversion of the ABM Treaty from a bilateral to a multilateral agreement represents a substantive modification of the treaty. First of all, multilateralization changes the agreement by altering the definition of territory, which is at the heart of the treaty. Article I of the 1972 ABM Treaty states, `Each Party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems for a defense of the territory of its country.' 
Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding on Succession to the ABM Treaty, territory would now be defined as the `combined national territories of the U.S.S.R. Successor States that have become Parties to the Treaty.' The term periphery would also be changed to mean the combined periphery of all the former Soviet states party to the treaty. Thus, instead of the treaty applying to the territory of a single nation, in the case of the former Soviet Union, it would apply to a number of nations. 
Multilateralization would also be a substantive change since it would create a system of unequal rights under the treaty, wherein the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union would be treated as second class citizens. The ABM Treaty that the Senate agreed to 25 years ago created identical rights and obligations for each party. Under the memorandum of Uunderstanding on succession, however, only two of the potential parties to the treaty--the United States and Russia--would be permitted to field an ABM system. Other nations, while responsible for regulating ABM activities on their territory, would not be allowed to deploy such a system. For example, Ukraine could locate new early warning radars on the periphery of its territory, oriented outward, but would not be permitted 
to protect its capital with an ABM system. 
The multilateralization of the ABM Treaty also undermines U.S. efforts to promote the independence of the former Soviet republics. The memorandum of understanding on succession states that the term capital of the U.S.S.R. will continue to mean the city of Moscow. This designation, in addition to granting the New Independent States inferior rights under the treaty, and defining territory and periphery as the combined total of the former Soviet states sends the wrong message. It tells the New Independent States that they remain linked to Russia, without equal rights. 
Finally, multilateralization represents a substantive change to the agreement since it would diminish U.S. rights and influence under the treaty. New parties will surely be given a seat at the Standing Consultative Commission [SCC], which interprets, amends, and administers the ABM treaty. Under the 1972 ABM Treaty, the United States could take actions through bilateral agreements with the Soviet Union. By expanding the number of nations in the treaty, it will now be necessary to reach multilateral consensus to interpret or amend the treaty. One country, such as Belarus, could effectively block United States actions or demand concessions, even if Russia and the other parties to the treaty agreed with the United States. Negotiating changes or common interpretations of treaty obligations with Russia is a difficult task. Adding up to 11 new parties to the treaty will make this process much more difficult. 
In addition to the reasons I have cited as to why multilateralization would substantively modify the ABM Treaty, and the legislative history compelling the administration to submit the agreement to the Senate for advice and consent, the way the Senate has considered succession agreements for the various arms control treaties concluded between the United States and the Soviet Union further supports the case for Senate consideration of any ABM successorship document. 
Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the only arms control treaty which was not re-submitted to the Senate for advice and consent due to changes in countries covered, was the INF Treaty. This treaty carried a negative obligation, namely not to possess intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Since no treaty terms were altered and U.S. rights and obligations remained unchanged, advice and consent was not necessary. 
The resolution of ratification for the START I Treaty was accompanied by a separate protocol multilateralizing the treaty, which was submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. 
This same protocol determined successorship questions for the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
Finally, the Senate specifically considered the question of multilateralization of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe [CFE] treaty under condition #5 of its resolution of ratification. 
As I have discussed today, the addition of parties to the ABM Treaty clearly represents a substantive modification of the treaty. The Defense Authorization Acts passed by the Senate in 1995 and 1997, and the history of how this body has considered succession agreements to previous arms control accords with the Soviet Union strongly support the submission of any ABM multilateralization agreement to the Senate. Voting to require the administration to submit the ABM multilateralization agreement for advice and consent, simply protects the Senate's constitutional role in treaty making. Reasonable people may differ over the merits of the ABM Treaty or the addition of one or more countries to the agreement, but I believe all my colleagues can agree that before this new treaty is implemented, the Senate needs to fulfill its constitutional duty by considering whether to give its advice and consent to this new agreement.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Texas for yielding and for presenting his amendment. 
I fully support the Gramm amendment. I hope that shortly our colleagues will support it as well. 
Let me say at the outset that I think we all support the disaster relief that is provided in the underlying legislation, whether we agree with the specific level or not. Certainly my heart goes out to the families that have lost their homes and their businesses and their schools and who have suffered because of these recent floods and snows. We have all seen the devastation on the television and read about it in the newspapers. I think all of us support what we can do about that. 
I also think that we owe it to the rest of the people in the United States not only to put the full resources of Government into the States in which these disasters occur but also to ensure that the taxpayers of the United States, in effect, don't have to pay twice. We should ensure that the money that is spent in the States where these disasters have occurred is counted fully in our budget process. 
It is, I think, interesting that in the very week that the budget agreement was announced, we have before us a piece of legislation that would add to the budget deficit in violation of that agreement. 
I think we owe it to the American people to make sure that in solving one serious problem, the disaster problem, we don't make another problem worse. We can and we should find some way to meet our obligations without just adding to the budget deficit. 
As I said, it was just 6 days ago that the White House announced the budget agreement that would result in a balanced budget by the year 2002. The ink is not even dry on that agreement--in fact, parts of it have not even been written--yet the very first piece of legislation to come to the Senate floor after the agreement was announced is a bill to add $6.6 billion to the Federal budget deficit over the next few years. 
It seems to me, if people are going to have any confidence in the budget agreement that was struck with the White House, and we expect them to believe what we say about balancing the budget, that we cannot continue this kind of business as usual. We have to begin exercising some discipline. That means that this is a good time to start by saying that what we spend will be counted in our budget in order to know whether we are in balance. It would be one thing if there were no other way to get the aid to the flood victims except to borrow. 
But it is quite another thing when we ignore other options in order to keep spending on other programs. 
What would it take to pay for this emergency spending bill? Well, it takes only two things. In the first year, it is less than 2 cents on every dollar in spending reductions in other programs to ensure that the money that needs to flow immediately in the remainder of this fiscal year can flow. And for the remainder of the money to be spent, it would merely have to count in our budget so that we can know whether we are in balance. That may mean growth in some other areas might have to be restrained. 
We know that these kinds of disasters have always occurred and will continue to occur because they are natural disasters, and yet we do not plan for them. We spend every nickel that we have, knowing that if there is an emergency, we can appropriate additional funds. And if the past is any guide, we will simply add that onto the deficit rather than include it in the budget that has to be balanced. 
The Appropriations Committee acknowledged in its own report that the number of major disaster declarations in the 1992 to 1996 period has increased 54 percent. In other words, we had ample warning that something would occur somewhere. Had we prepared for the need for disaster assistance last fall instead of using every extra dollar to meet President Clinton's demands for new spending, we would already have been able to respond to the emergency in the Midwest and elsewhere around the country. We would not need to be here today debating a bill to spend additional money. But by ignoring potential disasters last fall, we merely paved the way for adding to the deficit now when the need for relief takes precedence over budget concerns. 
I know some will say that this bill is already offset by reductions in budget authority. Frankly, that is Washington speak. The Congressional Budget Office tells us this measure is going to add nearly $1 billion to the deficit this year and about $6.6 billion over the next several years. It is true that budget authority may be offset but outlays are not. And outlays are what count.

Mr. KYL. Let me explain to those who may be watching and do not appreciate the difference between budget outlays and budget authority what we are talking about here. 
Congress frequently passes laws granting authority to spend amounts of money on Government programs, but until that authority is backed up by appropriations, it does not mean anything. 
Granted, you have to have the authority, but you also have to have the money. When we say that we are going to offset this disaster relief by rescinding certain budget authority, that authority may never be funded. It frequently is not funded, and as a result it is not really offsetting actual expenditures or money that is going to be spent. It is merely offsetting authority that may or may not ever be funded and money that may or may not ever be spent. 
Senator Gramm has done a good job of analogizing the two things that are necessary to writing a check. You need a check or a checkbook of checks and you also need some money in the bank. The budget authority is like your checkbook, but unless you have the money in the bank, the checkbook does not do you a whole lot of good. So you tear up a bunch of checks and throw them in the wastebasket and say we have offset the spending. You have not really done that. All you have done is removed that check, not the money in the bank. We need to offset the spending in this disaster relief bill, which we support, with actual money so that we do not end up spending both and thereby break the budget deal. 
I will conclude at this point. Again, we just agreed to a 
budget deal that allegedly will result in a balanced budget in 5 years. Unless the Gramm amendment passes, that budget deal will be broken before it is ever signed, before we even vote on it. It will be broken this week when we pass this supplemental appropriations without offsetting future spending in the next 5 years. I support the Gramm amendment.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, everyone agrees that ridding the world of chemical weapons is a noble and worthy goal to pursue. These are weapons that no nation should have in its stockpile--and that includes the United States. By law, the U.S. stockpile will be destroyed whether or not the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] is ever ratified by the Senate. Opponents of the Convention support that action. 
Notwithstanding agreement on the goals of the CWC, we do not believe that this treaty can ever achieve the goals. It will not accomplish its objective of being global, verifiable, and effective ban on these weapons. Moreover, because of deficiencies in the treaty--which, by its terms, adopting parties must ratify wholesale without amendment--we believe the United States is better off without the CWC than with it. As a result, we could not support ratification absent certain certifications by the President prior to deposit of our instrument of ratification. 
Faced with the fact that the treaty is largely unverifiable, some ratification supporters argue that no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, and that, while not perfect, the CWC is better than nothing, especially since chemical weapons are so morally objectionable. Proponents further assert that the CWC is needed because it establishes an international norm that stigmatizes these weapons; that the CWC will bring us some intelligence we do not now have regarding the possession and manufacture of these weapons; and that it will provide trade benefits to U.S. chemical companies. Finally, they argue that we need to be a party to the treaty to protect our interests as details of implementation are worked out by the various parties. 
For the sake of argument, even assuming that these relatively modest benefits claimed for the treaty would in fact materialize, we believe these claimed benefits do not outweigh the costs. 
Opponents are convinced that the costs of ratifying the CWC outweigh the advanced benefits in several important respects, including the following: First, it would create a United Nations-style bureaucracy, 25 percent of the cost of which must be paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Second, it would put American businesses under a financially burdensome, security-compromising, and quite possibly unconstitutional inspection regime. Third, it would exacerbate the chemical threat we face by undermining existing multilateral trade restrictions, sanctions, and embargoes the United States has placed on rogue countries like Iran and Cuba. Fourth, it would require information sharing that signatory nations, if so inclined, could use to advance their chemical weapons programs. Fifth, the convention would give 
the Nation with the largest CW stockpile--Russia--an excuse to abrogate the Bilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA] it entered into with the United States to destroy chemical weapons. And this is not hypothetical speculation--there are growing indications Russia does not intend to comply with the BDA, which is much more restrictive than the CWC. Sixth, the prospect of ratification would create--there are already signs that it is creating--a false sense of security that encourages the United States to let its guard down on defending against the use of chemical weapons against American troops. Seventh, it degrades the value of treaties and moral statements because all nations understand it is unenforceable. 
The CWC represents hope over reality. It makes people feel good to say they have done something about a class of weapons we all abhor. But signing this piece of paper is not going to solve the problem--and that's the problem. Hard problems can't be wished away with naive hopes and tough talk in the form of yet another international agreement, no matter how many other nations have signed on. 
If the United States is to make a unique moral statement as proponents urge, we shouldn't be stampeded into ratifying this treaty `because other nations have.' The United States passed on joining the League of Nations even though, as with the CWC, it had promoted the League in the beginning and many other nations had decided to join it. Too often the international community has pronounced itself greatly pleased at solving the latest crisis with yet another treaty like the Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 which outlawed war as an instrument of national policy. And too often, as here, disappointment has followed because of the disconnect between the good intentions and the hard reality. To the argument that we will look bad because it was our idea in the first place, opponents say that real respect is rooted in responsible, honest positions; and that U.S. leadership in taking a different approach will be rewarded in the long term. 
It is not possible to ban the manufacture and possession of chemical weapons, and we should not delude ourselves into thinking it is possible. What we can do is back up our demand that no one use chemical weapons, with international cooperation based on the will to punish violators so severely that use is deterred. That too is not easy; but, as the use of nuclear weapons has been deterred, so too can the use of chemical weapons be deterred if we have the will.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank Senator Gramm of Texas for his leadership in dealing with this Medicare funding crisis that faces our country. The comments that he just made ought to illustrate to us why it is incredibly important for the Senate and the House to work very quickly to address the challenge set forth in the report issued yesterday by the President's trustees on Medicare. 
As Senator Gramm pointed out, and I will quote from the trustees' report: 
The Part A Hospital Trust fund will be able to pay for benefits for only about four years [until 2001] and is severely out of financial balance in the long range. The trustees urge enactment of legislation this year to further control program costs and extend the life of the trust fund. 
Clearly, Mr. President, the time is upon us. We cannot wait any longer. What I am going to talk about briefly today is the fact that we have some proposals that are very short range and very minor in their improvements, while Senator Gramm is taking a longer look at the problem here toward the end of fixing it for a long time so that we do not have to keep putting these Band-Aid, short-range approaches into effect. 
The primary problem is caused by the aging of the baby-boom generation. Instead of this generation providing the workers who are supporting, with taxes, a relatively smaller number of people in retirement, those baby boomers are going to be the retirees who need the medical care, and they will not be supported by as large a group of workers as exists today. 
The Medicare part A hospital program is already starting to feel this baby-boom bulge. As I said, it is caused by the rapidly aging group of baby boomers turning 65 and becoming eligible for Medicare. 
Medicare will hospitalize 200,000 more seniors this year than last year. And the net increase will get larger and larger until it plateaus somewhere between the years 2012 and 2032. During that 20-year period, the system will experience a steady net increase of 1.6 million new seniors per year. Think of that, Mr. President, 1.6 million baby boomers retiring each year for 20 years, creating this huge bulge of retirees that are going to be eligible for Medicare benefits. 
And at the same time, during this same period, the relative number of workers is going to be decreasing so the payroll tax revenues will dramatically decline. Without prompt congressional action and Presidential support--it is obvious; and the trustees made this point yesterday--Medicare will soon be unable to fulfill its commitment that our Federal Government has made to our retiree population. 
Let me discuss briefly the two plans of the parties. Neither the Republican plan or Democratic plan, frankly, were sufficient last year to deal with this problem. 
The Democratic plan relied primarily on provider reimbursement reductions to reduce costs. That means we just pay the hospitals and doctors less money to do the same thing. Well, there is a point beyond which that does not work. Obviously, the hospitals and doctors do not have to treat these patients and they will conclude after a point that it simply is not cost efficient for them to do so and they are not going to do so. 
Unfortunately, the Republican plan also relied, to a certain extent, on reductions in reimbursement to providers though less heavily than the Democratic plan. 
The Republican plan also had another feature which was good and that was that there had to be some real reform in the system. And competition was the centerpiece of that reform. The idea was that you controlled costs by having increased competition among those who were providing the benefits to the Medicare patients. You create different products--products that have names like PPO's, preferred provider organizations; PSO's, provider sponsored organizations; and Medicare savings accounts, MSA's; to go along 
with the HMO's, the hospital managed organizations; and others that provide the care to the seniors through different mechanisms, different combinations of hospitals and physicians, sometimes in what are called capitating plans, sometimes in other kinds of plans, but all of which are competing with each other and therefore through that competition costs are kept in line. 
The Republican plan also included medical malpractice reform to curb the high costs of defensive medicine practiced by physicians and hospitals as a means of avoiding liability lawsuits. 
The Congress and the President have acknowledged the need to slow the rate of increase in Medicare costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the President's current proposal would save about $89 billion over 5 years. The Republican plan last year would have saved about $105 billion over the same period, along with the savings attributed to increased competition. But the key point here is that no one contends that either of these plans will achieve long-term solvency. More is needed to save Medicare than just greater reductions to reimbursement providers. 
As I said, the overload of the system begins in about the year 2010 when the first wave of this baby-boom generation begins to retire. And the President's plan does not even make it to that year. The President's savings only work to about the year 2007. Then you would have to start all over. The Republican alternative is better but it staves off bankruptcy only until about the year 2012. So clearly, before this baby-bulge meltdown occurs we have to have longer-range reform. 
Regardless of the reimbursement to provider reductions or product competition structural reforms something more will have to be done because there just are not enough workers that will support the growing number of retirees. 
To put it in perspective, Mr. President, in 1964 there were 3.5 workers for every beneficiary. And the total has grown to 37 million beneficiaries. The Medicare trustees estimate that by the year 2030 when the last baby boomer turns 65 there will be only 2.2 workers per beneficiary. So the current system which functions on a transfer-payments basis made directly from worker to beneficiary is clearly unsustainable. That 2.2 workers cannot possibly pay all of the expenses to run the Federal Government, all of the retirement benefits for Social Security and in addition to that support this growing group of seniors for their health care needs. 
It is time to investigate whether an investment-based health care system may be part of the solution to this approaching meltdown. This is the subject that Senator Gramm was talking about a few minutes ago. His investigation is into several proposals that would ensure the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program. 
And one of those proposals would allow workers to create their own medical IRA, an individual retirement account, for medical purposes by redirecting some or all of their payroll tax--it is now 2.9 percent--into a savings account for medical purposes. His idea is that each employee's account would grow over his or her working life and would pay for health care after retirement. 
A series of studies have been done here at Texas A&M. And economists there in studying this have reached some interesting conclusions. For example, assuming a real rate of return of 3 percent--a very low rate of return on investment--a 22-year-old person could direct 1.3 percent rather than the current 2.9 percent of their payroll tax into a medical IRA, and at age 65 this person could purchase a policy that would provide roughly the same coverage that Medicare provides today. So you could put much less money that you are earning into this payroll tax and still come out the same place when you retire. 
If the real rate of return were the Standard & Poor's average over the last 70 years of 6.5 percent, a 22-year-old would have to invest only 0.4 percent of his or her wages to achieve the same result. So you can see that a real investment in an IRA-type investment by people would provide the same benefit at far less cost if the rate of return were even no better than the average that has existed over the last 70 years. 
Obviously, this kind of proposal would have to address some transition costs, the costs of converting from the current system to an investment-based system as well as Medicare's unfunded liability which is estimated today to be $565 billion. Without reform, this amount is projected to reach $3.9 trillion in 10 years, and in 20 years $6 trillion. 
Clearly, we cannot allow this system to continue. We are going to go bankrupt taking care of our Medicare population if we do not invoke fundamental reform. 
So the Congress and the President, both, must heed the trustees' warning, work together to protect current beneficiaries, while also working to provide a secure retirement for today's workers who are going to need something better than the Medicare system that is in existence today. We are going to need some kind of innovative program, such as that suggested by Senator Gramm, to enable them to invest a small amount today, which over time will grow to an amount that will take care of them in their retirement years. 
Increased Medicare product competition and medical IRA's funded by investing the payroll tax represent two of the many potential components of reform. We need to develop a consensus on these reforms on how to protect the current beneficiaries and the new group of baby boomers. If we begin doing it today, by the time the problem is really upon us, we may have a system in place that will provide this protection. If all we do today is support another short-range solution, we are going to find ourselves in true bankruptcy by the time the baby-boom generation retires. 
I commend the efforts of Senator Gramm of Texas in bringing this to our attention, in bringing innovative solutions to the floor. I hope my colleagues and I will be able over the next several weeks to put this into legislative form so in the long run we will have solved the problem, and future generations here will not have to worry about it the way we have to struggle with it today.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the condition we have before us right now is whether or not the United States will be a party to a meaningful treaty, that is to say a treaty that covers nations that it needs to cover. It will not do us any good if we are a party to a treaty, paying 25 percent of the costs, to inspect ourselves. Right now, the countries that have ratified this treaty are not the countries that are of concern to us. They do not have weapons. As a matter of fact, right now the countries that are parties have nothing to inspect. The United States, if it believes this treaty is ultimately going to have any positive effect, that is to say if it has significant verification features, and if it is global in the sense that most of the countries of the world that have chemical weapons are parties to it, and if it is enforceable--at that point in time the United States presumably could get something out of this treaty. In the meantime, the only thing we get out of it is the opportunity to pay a lot of money, as I say, to inspect ourselves. Because the countries that need to be inspected are not yet in it. 
Specifically, 74 countries have ratified the treaty and they are the countries of least concern to the United States. The three countries that have the largest amount of chemical weapons in the world--Russia and China and the United States--are not parties, nor are any of the so-called rogue countries of the world. 
Many of these countries have no intention of signing onto the treaty. North Korea, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Sudan have all refused to sign the treaty. Others, such as Cuba and Iran, have signed the treaty but have not yet ratified it. In the meantime, some of these countries, such as Iraq, continue to stockpile and develop chemical weapons. 
So, the question is, will the United States enter this treaty at a time when it is meaningless, or will we, instead, use our entry as a prod to cause other countries of the world that need to be parties to be parties. For the treaty to offer any potential improvement, however modest, to the national security interests of the United States, I think at a minimum it must affect those countries with aggressive chemical weapons programs and which have hostile intentions toward the United States. Let me just outline briefly who these--who some of these countries are. 
North Korea--North Korea's program involves the stockpiling of a large amount of nerve gas, blood agents, and mustard gas. And it is capable of producing much more, according to our intelligence sources. Its armed forces have the ability to launch large-scale chemical attacks using mortars, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and Scud missiles. And it is presently developing a new generation of medium-range ballistic missiles that will be able to carry chemical warheads. North Korea has neither signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Iraq--despite the most intrusive inspection and monitoring regime in the history of the world, Iraq has retained a chemical weapons production capability and continues to hide details and documents related to its chemical weapons program. The U.N. Special Commission believes that Iraq continues to hide chemical agents, precursors, and weapons. Iraq admitted in 1995 that it had produced over 500 tons of a lethal nerve gas agent before the Gulf war. The U.N. inspectors had previously been unable to uncover evidence of this, despite a more rigorous inspection regime than even those mandated by the Chemical Weapons Convention verification regime. As noted, Iraq has neither signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Iran--Iran has been producing chemical weapons at a steadily increasing rate since 1984 and now has a stockpile of choking, blister and blood agents of over 2,000 tons. It also may have a small stockpile of nerve agent. It has the ability to produce an additional 1,000 tons of chemical agents per year. 
It has signed but not ratified the CWC. Even so, and this is critical, Iran's chemical weapons program is among the largest in the Third World. It has continued to expand, even since Tehran 
signed the CWC. And the Central Intelligence Agency believes that Iran has no intention of abiding by the terms of the CWC. 
Iran is making improvements to its chemical capabilities that suggest it has made a long-term commitment to its chemical program. I repeat, the CIA believes that Iran has no intention of abiding by the terms of the CWC. It is the most active state sponsor of international terrorism. It is directly involved in planning and directing terrorist attacks. And it could supply chemical weapons to a number of terrorist groups. Iran has not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Syria has produced chemical weapons since the mid-1980's. The CIA believes that it is likely that Syria's chemical weapons program will continue to expand. Syria can indigenously produce nerve agents and mustard gas, and is stockpiling both agents. It may have produced chemical warheads for its Frog and Scud missiles for use against Israeli cities. Syria has not signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Libya--Libya has produced at least 100 tons of chemical agents, including mustard and nerve gas. Libya is capable of delivering its chemical weapons with aerial bombs, and may be working to develop a chemical warhead for ballistic missiles. It also possesses cruise missiles. Libya has neither signed nor ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, the point is, unless these countries are party to this treaty, whatever benefits the treaty has are essentially meaningless. This is one of the reasons why former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said this, in a letter he wrote about a week ago. He said:  
Those nations most likely to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention are not likely to ever constitute a military threat to the United States. The governments we should be concerned about are likely to cheat on the CWC, even if they do participate. 
In effect, [he wrote] the Senate is being asked to ratify the CWC even though it is likely to be ineffective, unverifiable, and unenforceable. Having ratified the convention, we will then be told we have `dealt with the problem of chemical weapons' when in fact we will have not. But, ratification of the CWC will lead to a sense of complacency, totally unjustified given the flaws in the convention. 
Finally, to the point. The Senator from Massachusetts said that we are somehow holding ourselves hostage to the rogue states. Precisely the opposite is the case. We decide when to join this convention, not because the administration says there is an automatic deadline under which we have to do so, but when we say it will matter. When we are not having to pay 25 percent of the costs of a meaningless convention, in effect 25 percent of the costs to inspect ourselves. Mr. President, $200 million a year to help this U.N.-style bureaucracy, in addition to putting the businesses of the United States through all the hoops they are going to have to go through in order to comply with this convention. 
I have written to my constituents the names of companies on the list supplied to us by the Government as potentially required to comply with the reporting requirements of the convention. They write back to me saying it would cost them $50,000, $70,000, or more than $100,000 a year, just to fill out the forms. 
What we are saying is, instead of putting our businesses through the expense and hassle of having to comply with this when nobody in the United States has any intention of violating this treaty--these companies back in Arizona have no intention of producing chemical weapons--instead of submitting ourselves to that intrusive bureaucratic regulation and expense, not to mention the expense to the U.S. taxpayer, let us be involved in this when it means something; that is to say, when the countries we really care about are involved in it. 
Finally, to the point that we are somehow associating ourselves with thugs by not joining, I find that really an argument that is, really--

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I don't want to use the word insulting, but it has no persuasive force, let's put it that way. 
Does this mean if a country like Iran or Cuba, for example, signs up, that we would be associating with lesser thugs? Actually, don't the proponents of the treaty want us to associate with thug nations, if this is going to mean anything? Don't we want all of those countries in the treaty with us? 
Somehow, under their logic, we don't want to associate with these thugs. Yet, they want to pass a treaty that, presumably, if it is going to mean anything, has these thugs in it, in which case we are associating with them. 
Obviously, the point is not whether we are associating with thugs. I don't think that any of us can fail to make appropriate distinctions here. The fact of the matter is, those thug nations, if this treaty is to mean anything, ought to be part of the organization and, at that time, the United States then could participate in a meaningful way. Until those thugs are a part of this treaty, we are just wasting our time and money and putting a lot of our citizens to an awful lot of unnecessary hassle. 
The point of this condition is to make a point, to make the point that the countries that really matter are not even going to be governed by this treaty. It is one of the reasons why this treaty, in the end, cannot be supported.

Mr. KYL. I will be very brief to a matter of news interest here in the Washington, DC, area. People might be watching this on a different channel of their television, viewing the ambulances and people attempting to assist, and at least two people who appear to have been exposed to some kind of chemical agent. My understanding is that Senator Lugar has just discussed this matter briefly, as well. This occurred at or near a B'nai B'rith facility here in Washington, DC. 
I think that while neither side in this debate would want to use an unfortunate incident to bolster their case, and while our first concern ought to be for the people who may have been exposed to some agent here--and we all certainly hope there is no harm done and that if, in fact, it was not accidental that the perpetrators are dealt with in the appropriate fashion--I think it is also an inappropriate place to make the point that contrary to those who assert that the Chemical Weapons Convention deals with this problem, it does not. We should be very, very clear about that. 
There are reasons for proponents to suggest that this Chemical Weapons Convention should be supported. There are arguments of opponents as to why that should not be the case. But I hope that we do not have people arguing on the floor of the Senate here that the Chemical Weapons Convention will deter terrorists, that somehow this will make us safer from terrorist attack, because it cannot fulfill that noble goal. We will literally be buying on to something that cannot come to pass if the treaty proponents try to sell it on that basis. 
As a matter of fact, there is specific declassified intelligence information directly on this point. I will quote that before the chairman resumes his time. A declassified section of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency document of February 1996, with specific reference to the Tokyo subway attack by terrorists at that time said: 
Irrespective of whether the Chemical Weapons Convention enters into force, terrorists will likely look upon CW as a means to gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear. The March 1995 Tokyo subway attack by Aum Shinrikyo would not have been prevented by the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
In May of 1996, another CIA report, a portion of which has been declassified, contains this statement: 
In the case of Aum Shinrikyo the Chemical Weapons Convention would not have hindered the cult from procuring the needed chemical compounds used in the production of sarin. Further, the Aum Shinrikyo would have escaped CWC requirement for an end use certification because it purchased the chemicals within Japan. 
There are some additional things we can quote. The point I am making is that reasonable people can differ about the pros and cons of this treaty. That will be reflected in the vote on the treaty here. I hope that Americans do not get the idea that we will be safe from terrorist attack or even significantly safer by the adoption of this Chemical Weapons Convention. Terrorist attacks are not what it was designed to deal with. I hope that point is crystal clear.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will, at a later time, join in thanking the various staff and other people who have been so useful in ensuring a good debate. I think the Senate has gotten very serious about this matter. As the majority leader said earlier, as a result of the application of various Members of the Senate, a great deal of progress has been made in trying to bring the sides closer together in getting a treaty that, if it is entered into, will be more in the interest of the United States than as originally submitted. 
There are a couple of conditions, however, in the resolution of ratification which we believe ought to be a part of this treaty before the President submits those articles for ratification, signifying the U.S. entry into the treaty. One of the most important is the one before us at this moment. There is a motion to strike this condition from the resolution of ratification. We believe that this condition should remain. As the majority leader earlier said, he believes this condition should remain. Here is what it provides: Prior to depositing the U.S. instrument of ratification, the President must certify four things: First, that Russia is making reasonable progress on implementing the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement entered into between the United States and Russia. Second, that outstanding compliance related to the 1989 Wyoming memorandum of understanding have been resolved to U.S. satisfaction. Third, that Russia has deposited its articles of ratification of the conventional weapons agreement. Fourth, that it is committed to foregoing any weapons development. 
Those are four important conditions, if our partner, Russia, and the United States are to effectively utilize the Chemical Weapons Convention. The reason is, first of all, because Russia is the world's largest possessor of chemical weapons. It has anywhere from 60 to 70 percent of the world's chemical stocks. For the Chemical Weapons Convention to be global, in the sense that it covers the weapons, and to be effective, it should involve the country with the largest inventory of chemical weapons. 
Now, Russia has signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, but has indicated that it will not ratify, at least at this time and, as a matter of fact, in a communication to the Vice President of the United States, one of the Russian leaders, Chernomyrdin, said, in effect, that Russia would prefer that the two parties, if they are going to come into the treaty, come in at the same time rather than one preceding the other, 
and, therefore, said that it would be integral to Russian entry that the United States entered first, which is what we are about to do. 
I think these four commitments by Russia are integral to the success of the Chemical Weapons Convention if we are to have a truly global ban. That is why this condition 29 should remain a part of the resolution of ratification. 
Quickly, to the four points: First, reasonable progress in implementing the 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Reasonable progress simply means that we are continuing to work on complying with it. That is what the Russians agreed to do when they entered into this agreement in June 1990. This is an agreement between President Bush and President Gorbachev. 
By the way, when proponents of this treaty speak of it as a Reagan-Bush-Clinton treaty, I point out the fact that the treaty was different in the Reagan and early Bush years than it is now. One of the underpinnings of the treaty was that this bilateral destruction agreement between Russia and the United States would be in place and would be enforced and would be complied with by the two parties. This agreement was designed specifically to ban the production of chemical weapons, their agents, the destruction of chemical weapons agents, to provide for onsite inspections of CW facilities, and require data declarations. 
The Bilateral Destruction Agreement is central to the CWC before us today. Without it the Chemical Weapons Convention is a much weaker treaty than it would otherwise be. The CWC was negotiated with the assumption that the United States and Russia would both destroy and verify destruction of their stockpiles under the Bilateral Destruction Agreement. But Russia has not implemented the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, and it appears that it has no intention of doing so. 
Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, in this letter to Vice President Gore that I mentioned before, essentially stated that the Bilateral Destruction Agreement and the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding have outlived their usefulness insofar as Russia is concerned. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention before us today is no substitute for the Bilateral Destruction Agreement. Under the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, the inspectors of Russian facilities would not be international inspectors. They would be U.S. professional inspectors, and there would be more frequent inspections. The United States would have guaranteed access to data declarations, none of which would be the case under the CWC. 
So it is important that Russia at least indicate to us that it is making reasonable progress to implement the BDA before we enter into force CWC. 
Second, the resolution says there should be compliance with the 1989 Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding. Without getting into a lot of detail, I will simply note that this memorandum of understanding was essentially an agreement between the two states that we would exchange data on how much chemical weapons we had and to provide the information on the status for binary weapons programs. 
To comply with this declaration, the United States has given information to the Russians. Russia declared a 40,000 metric ton agent stockpile. However, present reports and other information allege that the Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that the former Soviet--now Russian--stockpile could be as large as 75,000 tons. Russia has refused to provide information on the status of its binary weapons program. And, according to the former Director of Central Intelligence Jim Woolsey, `The data we have received from Russia makes no reference to binary chemical weapons or agents. That is contrary to our understanding of the program that was initiated in the former Soviet Union.' 
There are additional indications of activity on the part of the Russians, all of which suggest that they are not in compliance with this 1989 memorandum of understanding. 
Our second point in this condition is getting compliance with that. 
Third, we want the Russians to ratify this treaty at the same time that we do. That is what they want to do. We believe that will be a preferable course of action to the United States entering into the treaty causing the Russians to be concerned that we would set up the rules of the treaty, in effect, in a way that would be amicable to their interests, thus perhaps causing them never to enter into the treaty.

Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, Senator Helms had intended to present these remarks, and he cannot be here right at this moment. Therefore, I am going to proceed to deliver his remarks and then also yield to the majority leader should he wish to make a remark or two about this condition. 
If ratified, Mr. President, the Chemical Weapons Convention would provide inspectors from foreign countries unprecedented access to U.S. facilities, both commercial and Government-related. Inspectors would be permitted to interview site personnel, inspect records, photograph onsite apparatus, take samples, record readings of plant equipment, and use instruments to monitor processes. The risk that trade secrets or national security secrets could be stolen during inspection is very high. 
First, proprietary information is often the basis for a chemical company's competitive edge. Industrial espionage can enable a competitor to obtain at a minimal cost information that its originator acquired only through an enormous investment of time and money, thereby erasing the company's competitive advantage. For this reason, the theft of trade secrets can cripple even a giant company and can be fatal to a smaller enterprise. 
Second, because chemicals covered by the CWC are used in a variety of aerospace activities, from the manufacture of advanced composites and ceramics to additives for paints and fuels, dozens of defense contractors are targeted for routine inspections under the CWC. That means that when we are talking about proprietary information, we may also be talking about national security information. 
A company such as Lockheed Martin, Courtalds Aerospace, Hercules, Raytheon, and the Hexcel Corp. will be forced to allow foreign nationals access to their facilities, employees, and records. Our national laboratories further could be inspected under this treaty, as will Government facilities. 
Previous national trial inspections conducted in the United States in preparation for the CWC revealed that inspections under the treaty are an extremely dangerous threat to sensitive information. Soil and water samples were collected in the vicinity of rocket propellant production facilities on one such inspection. They were analyzed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Using modern techniques, analysts were able to discern classified information about the formulation of the rocket propellant and the process used to make it. 
Finally, Mr. President, China and others likely intend to use CWC inspections for espionage purposes. They should not be allowed to do that. The officials of the preparatory commission for the Organization of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW, have stated that all of the Chinese inspectors were directed to volunteer for the organization and that these inspectors have direct ties to China's defense chemical warfare program. Accordingly, and the point of this condition, the Senate should uphold this provision which would direct the administration to exercise a United States treaty right--as the Senator from Delaware pointed out, we have this right under the treaty--we are simply directing the President to exercise this right to bar inspectors from China, which has an active industrial espionage program and has violated United States nonproliferation laws, from entering the United States to engage in these inspections. In addition, it would prevent inspectors from countries which are hostile to the United States and are state sponsors of terrorism--Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba--from participating in these inspections. 
Mr. President, I do not think this is an unreasonable provision. There is no downside to the provision, only the positive potential that fewer trade and national security secrets would be handed over to countries that are openly hostile to the United States. 
Therefore, I urge the Senate to reject the motion to strike. 
At this time I yield the remaining time to the distinguished majority leader.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let met summarize the argument the majority leader and I made in opposition to the motion to strike this condition. 
The treaty currently provides for the President to say that he does not want inspectors from certain countries coming into the United States. There is a reason for that. What we are doing is directing him only in two cases to, in advance, say, these are the countries covered: Those countries that sponsor state terrorism, pursuant to our definition of that, and China because of its violation of another law. 
So it is only those countries that have violated American law and who are the state-sponsored terrorists who can be denied inspectors in the United States.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I do not like to disagree with my friend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein. And I find that I rarely disagree with my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. This is a treaty which has caused division among reasonable people. I respect their views immensely. We find that even former members of the same administration, the Bush and Reagan administrations, now find themselves on opposite sides of this issue. So it is a matter upon which reasonable people can differ. As I said, I respect the views of those who have disagreed with me, and they have certainly shown a respect for my views, which I appreciate. 
These two articles are among the most important in the treaty, and I think a little bit of background is important for us to understand the reason we believe that it is important that they not be included in the treaty when we enter into force. 
We have said initially that this treaty is not global. It doesn't cover countries that it should. It is not verifiable. It is fairly well acknowledged there are no sanctions. But supporters have said it is better than nothing. There are some advantages to it. Our response is that in some respects it is not better than nothing. 
In particular, these two sections, articles X and XI, make it worse than nothing, and we ought to get rid of them. It is true that to get rid of them, the states parties to the convention have to agree. That will take some time. But we believe it is better, before the United States enters, when we have the leverage to cause that renegotiation to occur, to have it occur at that time. Therefore, the resolution of ratification is passed, but prior to the President actually depositing those articles, the President certify to us that articles X and XI have been removed, or fixed. 
Why is this so important? Secretary of Defense Cheney was quoted by the distinguished chairman of the committee, and I think he succinctly said it. Therefore, I will summarize these thoughts by quoting Secretary Cheney in his letter of April of this year. 
He said:  
Indeed, some aspects of the present Convention--notably, its obligation to share with potential adversaries like Iran chemical manufacturing technology that can be used for military purposes and chemical defensive equipment--threaten to make this accord worse than having no treaty at all. In my judgment, the treaty's Articles X and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the globe.

<TEXT>
Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what is it about articles X and XI that cause Secretary Cheney and so many others to conclude that they should be removed? I will quote to you the language of both. They are on the chart behind me. 
Article X provides that `* * * each state party undertake to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material, and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons.' 
In other words, in plain English, those parties which have defensive capability will undertake to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of that technology, equipment, and so on, to the countries that don't have them. They shall have the right to participate in the fullest possible exchange of that equipment. 
Article XI is the article that says that the states parties shall: `(b) undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of chemical equipment, and scientific and technical information relating to the development and application of chemistry for purposes not prohibited under the convention.' 
That is to say, peaceful purposes. And, second, that the state parties `shall not maintain among themselves any restrictions, including those in any international agreements, incompatible with the obligations undertaken under this convention, which would restrict or impede trade and the development and promotion of scientific and technological knowledge in the field of chemistry for industrial and agricultural research, medical, pharmaceutical, and other peaceful purposes.' 
These two provisions were inserted in the treaty essentially as inducements to get the parties to join the treaty, in effect, saying, `If you will join the CWC, those of us who have this technology and these chemicals will provide them to you. We will sell you the chemicals for peaceful purposes--not for chemical weapons. And we will provide you the defense technology so that you can defend against any possible use against you.' Of course, the price for having that right is not developing chemical weapons. 
In this respect, the treaty was compared to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the so-called `Atoms for Peace,' which said that if the countries would forswear the development of nuclear weapons building that the developed countries of the world would provide them peaceful nuclear technology. For some countries this worked. But sadly we know that a couple of other countries used the peaceful technology to build their nuclear weapon capability. 
So, Secretary Cheney, and many others, fear that these sections, these articles, would permit countries--since they have been induced to come into the treaty with these commitments--to then call upon those commitments from the countries that have this equipment. 
Is this an unreasonable assumption? Today, we are basically hearing statements that suggest that that is not the way it was intended at all. 
That is a very recent phenomenon. As a matter of fact, right after the CWC was signed, it was very clear to all states parties that they begin to dismantle the trade restrictions they had in place on chemicals in order to come into compliance with the CWC. 
According to the administration in testimony before the Senate, and I am quoting now, `Australia Group members'--these are the countries that have agreed not to sell chemicals to terrorist states--`in August 1992 committed to review their export control measures with a view of removing them for CWC states parties in full compliance with their obligations under the convention.' 
They knew that those trade restrictions were incompatible with the new commitments they had undertaken in articles X and XI of the convention, and the Australia Group itself issued a formal statement which concluded again that states parties were reviewing this, and I am quoting, `with the aim of removing such measures for the benefit of states parties to the convention acting in full compliance with the obligations under the convention.' 
The point being that when the treaty went into effect the parties knew full well that trade restrictions they had were no longer compatible with the convention, with articles X and XI, and that they were going to have to review limiting those trade restrictions, and the Australia Group is a very successful group of countries that has trade restrictions against trade in chemicals to these terrorist states. 
Well, we then began raising the questions about articles X and XI. The administration position changed 180 degrees, Mr. President. The administration began to say, well, actually, we could continue our restrictions under these two articles. And we said, well, it will not do any good unless everybody else does it. They said, we could even persuade the Australia Group countries to do that. In other words, to do exactly the opposite of what they had originally decided they had to do to be in compliance. 
So the administration has made much of and my colleagues have spoken of the fact that the United States will now interpret the Chemical Weapons Convention as not requiring us to provide this equipment and as enabling us to maintain trade restrictions even despite articles X and XI. Moreover, that we have even tried to get our fellow Australia Group countries to maintain their restrictions in place. 
That is laudable. We have at least pushed the rock that far up the mountain. We have got them to agree these two sections should not operate the way they plainly say they will. I think it is a little unseemly to be signaling before we have entered the convention that we are going to violate it up front and convince many of our friends to violate it, because, frankly, it is the right thing to do because articles X and XI ought to be violated by us. They have no place in this treaty. 
The problem is the administration has also glossed over the fact that while we may interpret the treaty this way, there are others who do not. For example, China does not. Iran does not. And there are other countries that we heard about in our classified session this morning that do not. They explicitly understand that the treaty means what it says. And therefore two parties that have signed, not yet ratified but signed the agreement have indicated that they intend to continue their trade. And this is China selling chemicals to Iran, for Iran's chemical weapons program. That is the problem. And it is true that nothing prevents that trade from occurring today, Mr. President, but the problem is that the Chemical Weapons Convention gives them the color of law, the legal authority to be able to say: Look, we are parties to the treaty. The treaty says we can do it, so stop complaining and, by the way, don't impose any restrictions on us because of what we are doing. 
I do not know how long it will be before chemical companies in other countries are going to say wait a minute, why should the Chinese have all the action here; we would like to have a piece of that action, too, and therefore when one country breaks an embargo it begins to fall apart. That is why I submit that just focusing on United States action under the treaty is not going to solve the problem. 
There is also the idea--and this is really not a proper legal argument, but some have said that article I supersedes the specific articles of the convention. Now, for those who are lawyers, they recognize this is not true. The specific always governs over the general. Article I is a general prohibition. The very specific articles such as articles X and XI will control. They are the specific implementation of the treaty. 
But to conclude now, Mr. President, the President of the United States has said given the fact that there are concerns, continuing concerns about articles X and XI, I am going to write a letter which maybe will put your mind at ease, and that letter has been referred to here by some of my colleagues. I do not doubt the sincerity of the President in sending the letter and 
certainly do not doubt the sincerity of my colleagues in believing that letter provides some solace, but I would like to make five points with respect to that letter. 
If the things under articles X and XI happen that we think will, it does not solve anything for the United States to pull out of the treaty as the President says he might do. The time to exercise leverage is now before we are a party to the treaty. And what we are saying is prior to the United States getting into the treaty, we should make sure that articles X and XI are removed so that these bad things do not happen. Once they happen, there is no point of the United States pulling out of the treaty. That does not solve anything. So what the President says he is willing to do, frankly, is not an inducement. 
Moreover, there is the argument that it is better to be inside the treaty than outside the treaty. And believe me, once we are inside it is going to be much harder to leave than it is to get in in the first place. 
Third, certifications of the kind that the President indicated he would be willing to make are very, very hard to do. There are a whole series of certifications that have to be made under U.S. law. They are too hard. We end up not doing them. The certification of Mexico is a good example, to certify that they are cooperating with us in the war on drugs. Most people believe that that was not an honest certification. But the desire to cooperate with Mexico was so strong that it overrode the point of being honest in the certification. The same thing is true with the Arms Control Disarmament Act, the annual Pell report, section 51. We know that Russia is not in compliance with the Biological Weapons Convention or with the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding or with the Bilateral Destruction Agreement, but the most this administration has ever done is to conduct high-level discussions with the Russians. It is too hard to certify that they are in noncompliance and therefore take the action that is required. 
The same thing is true under the Export-Import Ban Act with respect to violations by China and several other laws that China has violated with respect to its chemical weapons transfers to Iran. These certifications are simply too hard. And while I agree, I am sure the intentions of the President are appropriate in this regard, those certifications I submit are not going to be done. 
The time line here is important, too. This is a commitment by President Clinton. It is between 2 and 3 years before any action can be taken under this convention. That means that this President's term will almost be expired before he would have the opportunity to even consider the issues that are set forth in his letter. So it is not an effective commitment. 
And finally, Mr. President, the letter only deals with United States actions, the point that I made in the beginning. The question here is not United States actions. The question has always been what are we going to do with those countries of the world that seek an offensive chemical weapons capability, a capability that we would like to deny them, countries like Iran, the one I have been talking about here. This commitment, the President's commitment in his letter does absolutely nothing with respect to the sales of chemicals and chemical technology from a country like China to a country like Iran. It doesn't affect it at all. 
So while it is a nice commitment to have made with respect to the United States participation and attempting to keep the Australia Group together, the fact is it does not deal with part of the problem that has concerned us from the very beginning. 
I conclude with this letter to simply make this point. As I said, reasonable people can differ, and I respect the views of those who disagree with me. They have sincere belief that this treaty is better than nothing. And if they believe that way, they should vote yes on this treaty. There are also those of us who disagree with that proposition. But I urge my colleagues, if you believe that this letter provides the basis for support for the treaty, I honestly believe that is incorrect. If you are going to vote yes on this treaty, do it for grounds other than this letter because it does not provide a satisfactory response to the very real problem that has been discussed by Secretary Cheney, by Secretary Weinberger, by Secretary Rumsfeld, by Secretary Schlesinger, and a host of other people who have all said that the fundamental problem is articles X and XI. Unless they are removed, we are looking for more proliferation, not less, under this treaty. And it is for that reason the motion to strike should be defeated, Mr. President.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I always enjoy holding court with my friend from Delaware. We have had some of these debates in the past, and this is the thing that lawyers like to argue about, but I believe that most lawyers will agree with me that what they learned in law school was that the specific provisions of the contract always prevail over a general statement at the beginning of the contract. There are a lot of rules of instruction. Later provisions generally govern over previous provisions on the theory that you later describe your intent, fully cognizant of what existed before. The same thing is true with specific provisions of the contract, and that is why article I is called, not `CWC article I,' but rather `general article.' `Article I, General Obligations.' 
Then article II is definitions, and after that are the specifics. This is the reason why the Australia Group itself issued a statement right after this convention was entered into undertaking to review, in light of the implementation of the convention, the measures that they take to `prevent the spread of chemical substances and equipment for purposes contrary to the objectives of the convention with the aim of removing such measures for the benefit of states parties to the convention acting in full compliance with the obligations under the convention.' 
Australia Group members would not have had to do this under the interpretation of the convention by my friend from Delaware. Rather, they began to do this because they read articles X and XI the same as the many experts do that I cited earlier as limiting our ability to impose trade restrictions on states parties to the convention. That is why it says we will undertake to facilitate, and the other states parties have the right to the fullest possible trade in these chemical weapons. This is not just my view. I read to you what Secretary Cheney said before, James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and head of the CIA. It is plain that article X legitimizes such transfers.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Senator Helms and Senator Biden, the floor managers of this treaty, for the work they did in bringing it before us. 
Mr. President, I share the hope of the supporters of this treaty that it will help end the proliferation of chemical weapons. I believe, however, that history will record this treaty as one of the most well-intentioned yet least effective in our history. My hope is that we will not relax our efforts in other ways to reduce this threat, that we will not be lulled into a sense of security when it is ratified. 
With the protections in the original resolution of ratification, I voted for the treaty. But the protections having been stricken, I must vote `no.'

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are now going to commence additional debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I would like to begin with some general observations about treaties in general and about this treaty in particular. 
Mr. President, I want to begin by making what should be an obvious point. But in view of some of the rhetoric, I think it is important to reiterate it; that is, that the opponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention abhor chemical weapons just as much as proponents do. If this treaty performs as it is advertised to perform, I think everyone in this body would be supportive of 
it. Certainly those who oppose the convention support eliminating our chemical weapons, which will happen with or without the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
As has been noted by previous speakers, the United States is committed to eliminating all of our chemical weapons, and I suspect that everyone in this Chamber supports that position. So opposition is not based on the notion that we would retain our chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, I also ask that the Record reflect that the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, was present and voted `aye' on the last two votes. 
Mr. President, let me move forward to this proposition. Last week the Senate approved Senate Resolution 495, which demonstrates our commitment to do more. Whether one supports the Chemical Weapons Convention or not, this was an important bill to demonstrate our commitment, both here at home and abroad, to do more to try to stop the spread of chemical weapons, and not doing it alone, as my friend from Delaware has said, because Senate Resolution 495 contains several provisions that call for additional multilateral action on the part of the United States. It requires the President, for example, to use his best efforts to keep the Australia Group intact and to work against any weakening of the Australia Group restrictions on trade in chemicals; to work with Russia to ensure that it conforms to its obligations under the bilateral destruction agreement; for the President to impose sanctions on countries that violate international law with respect to chemical weapons. 
So Senate Resolution 495 was not a go-it-alone resolution. Quite to the contrary. Though it did close some loopholes in American law, it also reached out in various specific ways to enable us to deal with the problem of the spread of chemical weapons in more practical and specific ways than the Chemical Weapons Convention itself does. 
We have just had a vote on the resolution of ratification as presented by Senator Helms, the resolution that is currently before us. Many of us voted for that resolution, to make the point that we favor the Chemical Weapons Convention so long as it has certain protections built into it. I think it should also be clear that the opposition to the Chemical Weapons convention is not based on politics. 
As one of my colleagues said, there will be criticism of President Clinton. I don't think you will hear criticism of President Clinton. The opposition to this treaty is not based on politics. Indeed, it is not an easy treaty to oppose. I think those who oppose it must be recognized as doing so because of a firm principle and commitment rather than anything political. 
Another general point I would like to make is this. The Senate has a constitutional obligation to independently scrutinize treaties. It has been said that treaties are forever. Most of the treaties that have been ratified by the U.S. Senate are still in force--treaties that are many, many, many years old, some undoubtedly far beyond this time. It is like amending the Constitution. It requires a two-thirds vote. It requires a great deal of thought, therefore, on the part of the Senate. 
Mr. President, we are not a rubber stamp. No one should feel that they have to support this treaty just because it has been proposed. Treaties are no substitute for sensible action. They are in many respects inherently limited in their value, especially when the nations with whom they are entered into are not committed to the principles of the treaty. There are examples in past history that demonstrate this. 
The Kellogg-Briand Pact of 1928, which outlawed war, was obviously something that everyone felt good about supporting. But the actions didn't follow the words, and we know what happened. 
Also, this morning one of my colleagues quoted Will Rogers, who said, `We have never lost a war or won a treaty.' While that has a certain ring of truth to it, I don't think anyone would suggest that, therefore, all treaties are bad. As a matter of fact, we have supported very specific treaties that we think have done some good--arms control treaties like the INF Treaty, the START I Treaty, and the START II Treaty. As a matter of fact, I was asked to support the START II Treaty on the grounds that Russia would not ratify the START II Treaty until the United States did. So we did. We support the START II Treaty. It was ratified here. And 2 years later, the Russians still have not ratified the START II Treaty. So I agree with my colleagues who say that some treaties can be useful. I also make the point that one should not rely strictly on treaties. 
I also am troubled by the proposition that we somehow feel that we could do internationally that which we could never do domestically. I don't think any of us would contend, for example, that we think we can solve the problem of crime by going to the criminals in our neighborhoods and making a treaty with them to stop committing crime. Instead, we have police forces, we have laws, we have specific punishments, we have a court system, and we put people in prison when they violate 
those laws. In other words, we take specific action to deal with the problem. We don't rely upon the written word of someone who may be unreliable. Yet, in the international forum that seems to be very much in vogue. 
I don't think there is any reason that we can believe that a treaty with Iran, for example, is going to change its behavior, or Iraq, or Libya, or North Korea, or many of the other rogue states throughout the world. I think it is countries like Iran that want the benefits of the CWC and the lifting of the trade restrictions that we currently have with Iran, secure in the knowledge that it can avoid detection and/or any punishment that might follow that. Treaties generally do not modify the behavior of states. The law-abiding will abide, and those that intend to cheat will either cheat or not join at all. 
That is why these multilateral treaties, unlike some of the bilateral treaties that we entered into earlier, are more difficult to make work. Frequently what they do is complicate diplomacy and encourage dishonesty. We know that there are numerous examples of violations of existing treaties and previous treaties. But it was uncomfortable for us to bring those violations to light because, frankly, we thought that we had bigger fish to fry. We had more important matters with those states than the violation of a particular treaty. As a result, paradoxically it was more difficult to enforce these conditions once the treaty went into effect than it was before, because once the treaty went into effect, in order to upset the applecart, we have to find violations. We take it to the body that is going to find a violation and sanction, and we decide that would be diplomatically difficult because we want to accomplish some greater purpose with the state that is in violation. So we just forget the whole thing. What that does is literally put into law the violations that are occurring currently. So they can complicate diplomacy and encourage dishonesty. 
The bottom line about this general discussion is this: Sometimes treaties can be very useful and sometimes not. We have an obligation to make that distinction--not just to take the word that, if a treaty has been proposed, we have an obligation to support it. That is not the job of the U.S. Senate. Treaties are not an excuse to do that which is difficult. It is like making a New Year's resolution rather than beginning to diet. Sometimes we have to have the courage to begin the diet rather than just relying on a New Year's resolution. 
Mr. President, a second set of general comments: 
Reasonable people can differ over the Chemical Weapons Convention. We have a series of former governmental officials on both sides of this issue. We have former Secretaries of Defense, ambassadors, generals, columnists--all of whom have come out very publicly against the treaty. There is undoubtedly an equal number who have come out for the chemical weapons treaty. I hope we can begin this debate with the proposition that reasonable people can differ on this very important matter. Frankly, when former Secretaries of State--like Dick Cheney, Casper Weinberger, Don Rumsfeld, James Schlesinger; former Defense officials, such as Jeane Kirkpatrick and Richard Perle, Gen. P.X. Kelley, and Freddie Clay--when people like this say that they are opposed to the treaty, it ought to be clear that there are reasonable arguments on both sides and that neither side should claim that all right and truth and justice are on their side. 
Important columnists have also weighed in to this and find themselves on both sides of the issue. 
That is why I am troubled by the slogan of some people in the administration--and, in particular, I will cite the Secretary of State, who has said on national television that one of the reasons to vote for this treaty is that it has `Made in America' written all over it. Mr. President, that is not a substitute for reasoned argument. It is a slogan. It misrepresents the Reagan administration's position on the chemical weapons treaty, which, by the way, was very much different than the treaty that is before the Senate today. 
I can point out the fact that there have been other treaties proposed to the U.S. Senate that also had `Made in America' written all over them--like the League of Nations, which this Senate in its judgment decided not to rubberstamp but to reject. 
There were cries at the time similar to the cries you hear today that it would isolate America; that it would hurt our business; that we would be the laughingstock of the world; that, after all, President Wilson was the one who created this treaty and how could we vote against it. Moreover, we would be the pariah in the world if we voted against the League of Nations. But in 1919, this body exercised its judgment, its constitutional prerogative and it declined to allow the United States to participate. And I do not think today there are very many people who believe this country made a mistake by waiting and creating instead the United Nations. 
We, I think, should be able to go forward. I think it takes more courage sometimes to go forward with a position that acknowledges a mistake than it does to simply blindly go forward and perhaps have in the back of your mind the idea that you have made a mistake but it would not look good if you backed out at this time. 
That is another one of the arguments being made by the opponents; we would be embarrassed internationally if we backed out of the treaty at this point or caused part of it to be renegotiated. I submit that knowing we have made a mistake at least with regard to articles X and XI in this treaty, we should have the courage to fix articles X and XI before our resolution of ratification is deposited at The Hague. 
Now another general comment, Mr. President. No one has a monopoly on morality. Ours is a disagreement about means, not about ends. I want to make this point very clear because some people, perhaps a little overzealous to push this treaty, have inferred that those who vote against it somehow support the use of chemical weapons. I watched my grandfather die, Mr. President, from emphysema acquired as a result of his being gassed in World War I in Europe. Therefore, I take a back seat to no one in expressing my abhorrence for these despicable weapons and why I fully support the United States eliminating our chemical weapons and leading the world in that regard. We are the only country in the world with chemical weapons that has declared we will eliminate all of our stocks of those weapons. 
So I hope no one tries to lecture me about the evils of poison gas and how the only way to deal with that is through this Chemical Weapons Convention. We have been the moral leader of the world by imposing trade restrictions on countries like Iran, for example, restrictions that will probably have to be lifted as a result of this treaty because of articles X and XI. So I believe that insisting on renegotiation of articles X and XI would confirm our moral position. Our negotiators tried but failed to win key concessions on those provisions. In the future, they will be strengthened by the knowledge that the Senate will not go along with such halfway measures with a defective treaty. 
So, Mr. President, my point here is this. It matters how we make a moral statement, and simply ballyhooing a treaty that everyone knows is flawed does not enhance our moral stature. 
Now to some specific comments. Those of us who have reservations about the treaty have said that it fails in its key objectives, that if it met these objectives we would support it, that our opposition is based on two simple points. It fails to meet the objectives and it does more harm than good. 
In what way does it fail to meet its objectives. It was proposed as a global and verifiable and enforceable treaty. Unfortunately, it is none of those. First, it is not global. It does not cover the key countries and the key chemicals that are currently suspected of being the problems. Nine of the 14 countries suspected of possessing chemical weapons have not even signed this treaty. These countries include Libya, Iraq, Syria, North Korea, Egypt, Sudan, Serbia, South Korea, and Taiwan. So many of the countries in the world that possess the chemicals are not signatories. They are not going to bind themselves to it. And there is nothing we can do in terms of verification or inspection or anything else that is going to deal with it. The best way to deal with those countries is to do what we are currently doing, which is to maintain and enforce the restrictions of the Australia Group. 
Now, I spoke of that before. What is it? It is a group of 29 countries, including the United States, that have agreed among themselves not to trade these chemicals to countries that they think might want to develop chemical weapons with them. And we have these restrictions in place now. That is the best way to prevent the spread of these chemicals. Unfortunately, as an incentive to get countries to join the chemical weapons treaty, articles X and XI call into question the existence of those conditions and in fact in our view require that the states remove those restrictions and trade with the countries that are parties to the treaty. 
Second, the treaty is not verifiable. Now, proponents have said, well, nothing is 100-percent verifiable. That is a false standard, Mr. President. Nobody is claiming that it should be 100-percent verifiable. The question is whether it is effectively verifiable. And on that there is virtually unanimous agreement that, no, it is not effectively verifiable. I read to you a recently unclassified national intelligence 
estimate conclusion published originally in August of 1993 which stated:  
The capability of the intelligence community to monitor compliance with the CWC is severely limited and likely to remain so for the rest of the decade. The key provision of the monitoring regime, challenge inspections at undeclared sites, can be thwarted by a nation determined to preserve a small secret program using the delays and managed access rules allowed by the convention. 
And there are a variety of other statements I could read, including statements of the former Director of the CIA, all of which confirm the fact that this is not a verifiable treaty. 
Nor is the treaty enforceable. Even if you were to find a violation and you brought it to the bodies that are supposed to run this treaty, you would have to have a three-quarter vote, and there is no sanction in place. Once they found a violation, they would go to the country and say, would you please stop violating. If the country continued to ignore them, although the likelihood is the country would say, well, sure, we would be happy to, and eventually hide the material in such a way that you could not find a violation in the future, but assuming the violation continued and you continue to prove that, what is the sanction? There is none. Where do you go? The United Nations, the General Assembly. 
Mr. President, that is not a place where at least the United States has been treated very kindly in the past. And if you have to go all the way to the Security Council, Russia, China, other states have a veto. So it is unlikely that significant punishment would be meted out. As a matter of fact, the evidence of that probably most clearly is the case of Iraq which admittedly--I should not say admittedly. They denied it, but after inspection it was confirmed that chemical weapons were used against both Iran and against the Kurdish population of Iraq itself and yet the United Nations, the peace-loving nations of the world were incapable of mustering the courage to even name Iraq in a meaningless resolution about the use of these weapons. So it does not seem likely to me that the United Nations would muster the courage to impose any kind of particular sanction. 
Now, another one of the selling points of this treaty, according to its proponents, is, well, it is better than nothing. In other words, granted, it does not cover a lot of the countries we wished it covered and it is not very verifiable and there are not any particular sanctions in the treaty, but at least it is better than nothing. 
Our response to that is essentially twofold. First of all, it is very costly both in terms of money and potential constitutional restrictions and, second, there are some other very significant reasons why it is not better than nothing. 
In terms of cost, we know that the cost to the Government is going to be $150 million to $200 million annually. Businesses are going to have to pay between $200,000 and $500,000 for inspections. Just to fill out the forms, and there are thousands of businesses in this country that will have to fill out the forms, it is going to be a $50,000 to $70,000 proposition, and, of course, untold amounts lost in confidential business information which can result as a result of the industrial espionage that most people believe will result from the inspections under this treaty. 
Second, we mentioned the constitutional issues. There has been an attempt to fix about half of the constitutional issues. One deals with the fourth amendment, and there has been an amendment to say a search warrant would be required. The problem with that is that it would probably be found to be in violation of the treaty if a constitutional requirement were imposed to prevent the treaty from operating as it was written. 
So if we actually go ahead with a protection from fourth amendment searches and seizures, we may very well be found in violation of the treaty. On the other hand, those responsible for making such a decision may decide that we can have such a constitutional protection in which case I think we can count on all of the other nations that want to avoid detection doing the same thing and, of course, as a nation that lives under the rule of law we will abide by it in a proper way. And I think we can count on countries like Iran or China or Cuba, for example, to use that as an excuse not to allow the kind of inspections that would result in detection. 
The other part of the Constitution, the fifth amendment, presents a special problem that nobody has figured out how to fix. The fifth amendment provides that if there is a taking by the Government of property one is entitled to be paid. The problem is that when the U.S. Government imposes this regime on American businesses and individuals, it has not yet made the commitment to pay them. My own guess is that I would have a right to sue and the U.S. Government would have to pay but there is no provision for that. You cannot sue under the Federal Tort Claim Act, and so we would have to somehow construct an ability to sue the U.S. Government and provide for the unlimited liability that would result from such an undertaking. 
So that has not been dealt with either. 
The bottom line is the constitutional issues remain very much up in the air. 
Now, those are some of the costs. I think, however, the biggest costs are the following two. The mere fact that this treaty has been proposed has caused many to decide that we do not have to worry as much about defending our troops. I know the President has made a big matter out of saying that this treaty would help to protect our troops. Well, I think he is very wrong and his own administration officials verify this because for the last 2 years his representatives have come to the Congress and based on the fact that the United States signed this treaty and they presumed we would ratify it, this administration has called for reductions in spending on defensive measures for our troops. 
How can a President who tries to sell the treaty on the basis that it will be good for our troops, that it will protect them, come before the Congress not once but twice and call for a reduction in funding to provide defenses for our troops? Two years ago, $850 million. Fortunately, we restored it. What was the reason? The reason expressly was because this treaty is going to enter into force and we will be a part of it, as if the treaty were going to make the threat go away. 
And this year General Shalikashvili let us cut another $1.5 billion over 5 years out of this part of the defense budget, this despite the fact that the General Accounting Office in a very critical report following the Persian Gulf war, updated just last year, has found that our defenses are in a very serious state of disrepair; that we are not adequately prepared; that we have not provided our soldiers, our marines, our fighting people who are going to be confronting chemical or biological warfare the kind of training, the kind of equipment, the kind of antidotes, the kind of protection they deserve. So you have GAO in a very current finding that we are not doing enough for our troops, the administration trying to cut the funding to do more, and the President saying that the chemical weapons treaty will solve the problem. 
That is what I had reference to when I said that treaties can make you feel good, like you have solved a problem, but when it comes to the lives of American soldiers, we will not have done enough to protect them. And that is why we should not be lulled into a sense of false security by signing a piece of paper that I do not think people would loan money on if they wanted to get it back, frankly. 
So, this treaty does damage. It is worse than nothing. 
What is another example? You have heard me talk about articles X and XI. You are going to hear a lot about that, because articles X and XI turn out not to be such a good idea. I am going to discuss that in more detail later. They were put into the treaty at a time when it seemed like a good idea. Now it does not seem like such a good idea. The administration and everybody else acknowledges we have a problem here. The problem is, everybody is embarrassed to go back and change it. The administration says, `Well, we negotiated the best deal we could.' We say, `Because it is flawed, let us go back and take those two sections out.' But the administration does not want to do that. Not taking them out is going to result in a proliferation of chemical weapons and technology, not a restriction of it. Again, I will get into that in more detail later. 
The point I want to make here is that as long as this treaty has articles X and XI in it, it is going to be worse than nothing because it is going to result in the proliferation of chemicals rather than a restriction. I will just quote one sentence that a letter that former Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney wrote in this regard. He said, `In my judgment, the treaty's article X and XI amount to a formula for greatly accelerating the proliferation of chemical warfare capabilities around the globe.' So, in this second significant respect, the treaty makes the situation worse than it was before. 
Finally, as I made a point to mention before, it is going to significantly reduce our diplomatic options. Claiming violations will take back seat to more pressing diplomatic considerations. We have seen this in a variety of situations. When the Russians were in violation of the ABM Treaty and had a radar at a place called Krasnoyarsk, we were in delicate negotiations with them in a variety of other things and therefore it was `see no evil,' basically. `We are really not all that sure they violated the treaty,' when in fact our intelligence community knew full well they had. And after the Soviet Union broke up, its leaders said, `Sure we were in violation.' The question is, why didn't we do anything about it? Well, because we did not want to upset the diplomatic applecart. 
Think about China with MFN. Are we going to upset the diplomatic applecart? You see, today we do not have to because there is no treaty. Once a treaty is in place we have an obligation. If we know there are violations--perhaps, for example, with China--we would have an obligation to send inspectors over there and ask them to see what they could find. One of two things will happen. Either they are going to confirm there are violations--unlikely, in which case we are then going to have to do something about it. More likely, they will come back and say, `Well, we couldn't prove it.' 
As a result, China or whoever is doing the violating will have the Good Housekeeping stamp of approval. We set up this regime. You try to find people guilty. But the burden is so difficult you are not going to find people guilty. They are going to, in effect, be acquitted. And when they are acquitted we have then diminished our opportunity to negotiate with them, to tell them to stop selling chemicals, for example, to Iran or other countries we do not want to have them. In that respect, again, the treaty reduces our diplomatic options. It puts us into a box. It makes it more difficult to deal with these kinds of violations and in that respect again it is not better than nothing, it is worse than doing nothing. 
What are some of the administration's claims? First of all, they have made the astonishing claim that failure to ratify the treaty would mean that we are aligned with the pariah states of Iraq and Libya because Iraq and Libya are not going to sign or ratify this treaty. I hope the Secretary of State and the President of the United States could discriminate a little better than that. I could make the same argument to them. If we sign the treaty, we are going to be in with a bunch of other pariah states. Do they think it is any better to be with Iran or Cuba? These are states that have signed the treaty and presumably will ratify it. Obviously, that is not an argument that gets you anywhere. But it is the kind of simplistic, superficial argument that this administration is using to sell the treaty. It is an affront to the intelligence of the Senate. As I said, I hope the President and Secretary of State can make better distinctions than that. 
I also note it is a bit meaningless at this point to join the treaty, though 67 other nations have joined it, because they do not have chemical weapons. The countries that have chemical weapons have not joined it, and many of them are not going to. About 99 percent of the world's chemical weapons, according to open source material, are held by three countries, none of whom have joined the treaty: The United States, Russia, and China. We have a bilateral destruction agreement with Russia, in which we are trying to get them to destroy their chemical weapons--and they decided they are not going to follow through with that, apparently. So, what makes us think that we are going to do any good by joining the treaty, when about 80 percent-plus of the chemicals in China and Russia would be outside the purview of 
the treaty? 
The next comment made is, `No treaty is 100 percent verifiable.' I think I dealt with that before. Nobody is claiming it needs to be 100-percent verifiable, but when we say this treaty is not adequately verifiable or effectively verifiable, their comeback is, `Well, no treaty is 100 percent.' That is not the issue. The issue is whether it is effectively verifiable, and unfortunately no one claims that this treaty is effectively verifiable. 
No one, for example, has said that they have high confidence that this treaty will timely detect significant violations. As a matter of fact, one of the strong supporters of the treaty, a friend and someone who has served this country well, and we have a difference of opinion about the treaty, Ron Adelman, said in an op-ed piece he wrote on February 20, `Granted, the treaty is virtually unverifiable and granted it doesn't seem right for the Senate to ratify an unverifiable treaty. . .' he went on to say: `however, I think we are still better off by going ahead.' 
My point is that even treaty proponents acknowledge it is not verifiable, so let us not get into a debate as to whether it has to be 100-percent verifiable or not. It is not effectively verifiable. That is the point. 
I discussed a bit ago the argument that the CWC will protect American troops and prevent a terrorist attack. No one who has spoken to this from an intelligence point of view can credibly make the claim that this treaty will, in any way, shape or form, reduce the threat of terrorism. Let me repeat that. Our intelligence community is unwilling to say that this treaty would stop terrorist attacks. And even one of the much vaunted agreements that was entered into between our friends on the other side of the aisle and Senator Helms recognizes the fact that the CWC is not effective to deal with the problem of terrorism. Let me quote one of the recently unclassified assessments of our intelligence agency, the Central Intelligence Agency:  
In the case of Aum Shinrikyo [this is the cult in Japan that gassed Japanese citizens] the Chemical Weapons Convention would not have hindered the cult from procuring the needed chemical compounds needed in the production of sarin. Further, the Aum would have escaped the requirement for an end-use certification because it purchased the chemicals within Japan. 
The point is, here, that chemicals are so easily secreted, chemical weapons are so easily made in small, confined spaces, that it is essentially impossible to find all of them. And a terrorist group, in a room the size of a large closet, in Japan, was able to make the sarin gas that they used. This Chemical Weapons Convention has no capability to deal with that. I will say it this way: It is a fraud on the American people to suggest that we have to adopt this treaty in order to do away with terrorist use of chemical weapons. It will not be effective for that purpose. It may have some other beneficial effects, but no one should contend that it is going to help with regard to terrorism. 
The same thing, as I said, is true with regard to the defense of our troops. If this administration were actually pursuing a strong defensive capability for our troops, that would be one thing, but it is not. As a result, I think it is not an appropriate argument for this administration to base the ratification of the treaty on. 
Another argument of the administration is that this is important to protect the jobs in the chemical industry and that there would be some losses to our chemical companies if the treaty were not adopted by the United States. First, I would say that this is no reason for the United States to enter into a treaty, simply to enhance the financial balance sheets of American companies. We are all for doing that, we are all for helping American businesses do well, but one does not enter into a treaty for that purpose. I think there should be a question about whether our chemical companies ought to be selling these kinds of chemicals to countries like Iran and Cuba and China in any event, because that is the new market that will open up. These are countries that have signed the treaty, not yet ratified. Presumably they will ratify it at some point so there will be an added market for us to sell our chemicals. 
The other added market is that if the Australia Group restrictions come off, then our companies would not be restricted by the Australia Group limitations. In both cases they would be able to sell more chemicals. I would argue that that is not necessarily a good thing, even though it might enhance their balance sheets. 
And to the argument that somehow there will be a downside to them, that they will actually lose money, it is an argument that does not persuade me. Because folks should know that the only limitation that can be imposed on companies in countries that do not sign the treaty is with respect to so-called schedule 1 and schedule 2 chemicals. These are the chemicals of chemical warfare, of chemical weapons and their precursors, by definition, made in noncommercial quantities. So the only 
limitation that could ever be imposed upon American companies, if it ever were, would be on such a small amount of chemicals that, even by their own definition it would constitute only a fraction of 1 percent of the chemicals that are traded. We should pass the treaty for that? I do not think so. 
Another argument is that at least we will get more intelligence if we are a party to the treaty. This is the argument that says granted it may not solve all the problems but it is better to be inside than outside. I think this particular argument deserves a little bit of attention. 
I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I know how this works. I think I should explain a little bit about it. The claim is not true. Our intelligence agencies, of course, always are looking for new opportunities to get information, but it is not correct to say that the chemical weapons treaty provides us that mechanism. The chemical weapons treaty says that if you want to inspect another country for a suspected violation, you bring the matter to the council in charge of the treaty, and if it decides to go forward, it will appoint three inspectors--but it cannot be somebody from your country. So, it would be somebody from three other countries that go do the inspection. They come back and they deposit their findings with this body, this executive council. And by the treaty terms they cannot share that information with anybody else. It is secret. So the United States, not being a party to the inspection, does not have the information, and cannot have it, under the terms of the treaty. So there is only one way that we would gain more information under the terms of the treaty and that is by cheating, by violating the treaty, by somehow trying to steal the information, by somehow trying to turn one of those inspectors to be an agent for us in violation of the treaty terms. That is how we would get more information--not legally, under the treaty. 
What would we do if we found somebody cheating? Let us assume that we find that Russia or China has chemical weapons, is not destroying them--in other words, does possess in violation of this treaty. Would we insist on sanctions? How about today? Take the case of China. Would we insist on sanctions? We shake in our boots when the President of Taiwan comes over, attends his 25th class reunion at Cornell, and the Chinese Government threatens to lob missiles into Los Angeles and steams in the Straits of Taiwan and sends missiles over Taiwan. Are we going to impose sanctions on China because of a finding that they have maintained a chemical weapons stock? Are we going to have to prove to this international body, this executive council, that they are in violation? And at what cost to our relations? 
The problem is, with the treaty you can no longer ignore violations. You either object or it ends up in a whitewash. Either way it creates significant problems. 
There is a final argument that has been made recently and it mystifies me because it doesn't go anywhere but they have been making it, so I will try to respond. Proponents say we are getting rid of our weapons, and therefore the chemical weapon convention will force others to do so, too. It is absolutely true the United States is getting rid of our weapons. We are committed to doing that. We do not need the Chemical Weapons Convention to prove to the world that we are the moral leader of the world. We have said we are getting rid of ours. Nobody else has, but we have. 
So you don't need the Chemical Weapons Convention. I challenge my friends who propose the treaty, in what way will the chemical weapons treaty make the other countries get rid of theirs? That is the purpose, that is the goal, but there is no effective mechanism to make it happen, and there is no intelligence estimate or assessment to that effect, Mr. President. 
We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to go into classified session and hear just what our intelligence community has to say about the chemical weapons programs of other nations and about what we think they are going to be doing in the future, and I urge my colleagues to attend that session.

Mr. KYL. Finally, Madam President, there has been much made of the fact that in the negotiations over this treaty, numerous improvements were made and, therefore, we should remove our objections and go along with the treaty. 
First of all, I want to set the stage. Last fall when the treaty came before the Senate, the statement was that we couldn't touch it, that we couldn't negotiate anything, we had to use the resolution that came out of the committee and there were no changes that were possible; `You can't change the treaty; we're not interested in negotiating any terms.' 
It turned out there was not sufficient support for the treaty and, therefore, the administration had it pulled. Interestingly enough, last night I saw a news program, the Jim Lehrer News Hour, in which it was misstated that Senator Dole, the previous majority leader, asked the treaty to be withdrawn. He did not ask the treaty to be withdrawn. He was not even in the Senate at the time. He wrote a letter in opposition to the treaty, but he did not ask it be withdrawn. He just said he wouldn't vote for it if it were still in the Senate. It was withdrawn by the administration, by the Clinton administration, not by anyone here in the Senate. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the administration took the position that nothing could change, once the treaty was found not to have adequate support, the administration began to change its tune, and little by little, they began to sit down and talk to those who had objections. Over many months, various concessions were made which marginally improved the situation. Now, they are not concessions with respect to the treaty itself because it can't be changed, but there are some things which at least help to clarify how the United States is going to proceed, and had it not been for the considerable efforts of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, these changes would not have been made. So while they were critical of the chairman for his opposition to the treaty, it turns out that now they are bragging about the changes that he sought to have made, and I think that is a very important point, Madam President. Let me just repeat it. While initially deriding the concerns of the chairman of the committee, they are now bragging about the changes that he forced them to make, claiming that this makes it a better treaty, now we should all support it. It does make it a better treaty, but at the margins, not at the core. 
What has been negotiated? First of all, there are nine specific conditions that merely restate existing constitutional protections. Those could not have been taken away in any event, but it was helpful to get the administration to acknowledge that they existed. They were even reluctant to acknowledge some of these constitutional protections. We could do without them, because they are in the Constitution anyway, but at least it was handy to get the administration to acknowledge that they existed. 
Second, there are two conditions that merely allow the Congress to enact appropriations or approve reprogramming. As every Senator knows, we have that right. We are the body, along with the House, that enacts appropriations or approves reprogramming. So that was essentially meaningless, though handy to have the administration acknowledge. 
There are four conditions that call for reports. Whenever you see a call for a report, Madam President, you know that that means we tried to reach agreement on something, we couldn't, so we said, `By golly, we'll have a study on it, we'll have a report.' And that is what this calls for. There are seven conditions that call for Presidential certifications, all of which he can make today. These were not concessions by the administration. They were able to agree to these because these are certifications they can currently make. So one should not brag about those. 
Four additional conditions are a restatement of current U.S. policy. Again, we thought these were good to have on paper in connection with the treaty so there would be no mistake about what U.S. policy was. It isn't new, it isn't new policy, it isn't a compromise, it isn't a negotiated settlement; this is just a restatement in the resolution of ratification about existing U.S. policy. One of the conditions doesn't take effect until 1998. 
I conclude, then, with the two that have some meaning. One deals with search and seizures under the fourth amendment, and I discussed that briefly a moment ago. The other deals with the 
subject of riot control agents. We do not know what the courts will do with either of these two. 
I spoke to the issue of the fourth amendment. The resolution includes a statement that we will require search warrants, either administrative warrants or criminal warrants in the appropriate case. That may or may not be effective under the treaty. It may be declared in violation of the treaty. If not, other countries are going to be able to do the same thing. While the United States will assiduously adhere to the law and to the Constitution, my guess is if other States are able to do the same thing, we will suddenly find interesting provisions in the Iranian Constitution or Chinese Constitution that are going to constitute loopholes big enough to drive a truck through. 
The other matter is important, but in the overall scheme of things, I think perhaps more has been made of it than was generally warranted, and it is still not certain that it is resolved, but at least the allegation is that it is. This has to do with riot control agents, tear gas to most people. This was one of the areas in which the Bush and Reagan administrations had been very clear, and the Clinton administration changed policy, another example of a situation where this is not the same treaty that the Bush and Reagan administrations had in mind. They always thought you could use tear gas in certain situations; for example, to rescue a downed pilot, to deal with a situation where you had civilians surrounding an American hostage, for example. Rather than having to shoot those people, we say it makes sense to use tear gas to disperse the crowd and rescue the American. This administration said, no, we don't interpret the treaty as allowing that. Even people who support the treaty, like Gen. Brent Scowcroft, said, that's crazy, that has to be changed. It took a long time to get the administration to finally agree in concept to a change. I am still not persuaded the language does it, but let's assume in good faith they have really agreed to a change in this policy. What that will mean is that, at least in that limited kind of situation, we will be able to use tear gas. That is a positive development, but in light of the final points that I want to make here, it is not reason to change from supporting a treaty that is not global, not verifiable, not effective, does more harm than good. That change is helpful but not dispositive. 
What are the five unresolved issues? The way this treaty comes before the Senate, it is the Helms resolution of ratification. In other words, it is a resolution wrapped around the treaty. It has 28 agreed-upon items, and then, in addition, there are 5 that are not agreed upon. Those are the items that constitute the Helms resolution of ratification. To approve the treaty, we will vote on the resolution of ratification. The proponents of the treaty have the right under the rule here to seriatim move to strike each of these five remaining conditions. If they are all stricken, then we will end up voting for the Helms resolution of ratification sans these five protections. If four of them are stricken, we will have one, and so forth. 
What are these five unresolved issues? These are the core of the dispute. This is really what it is all about. And this is what I will spend the rest of my time on. 
The first issue says the country that has the most chemical weapons in the world, Russia, is not a party to the treaty. It has not complied with various agreements that we have concerning destruction of its chemical weapons stocks and its biological weapons, incidentally, and it has not agreed to abide by a memorandum of understanding with this country under which it would list its stocks of chemicals. These were key agreements that were part of the basis for the Reagan and Bush administrations' sponsorship of this treaty. Russia had agreed to these things. One is called the bilateral destruction agreement. The other is called the Wyoming memorandum of understanding. The Reagan and Bush administrations believed that if the Russians complied with these provisions, that the chemical weapons treaty might be a good thing. But they are not complying with them. Again, we will hear some details in the session tomorrow. But the fact of the matter is, we ought to require that Russia at least demonstrates some good faith to proceed down the path toward declaring what they have and getting rid of those things. If there is no indication by the Russians that they intend to do this, then it seems a little odd to be entering into a treaty where 60 percent of the world's chemical weapons are not even being dealt with and we are basically conceding to the Russians that they don't have to agree with these other agreements with us. What we are saying is, to try to apply a little leverage to our friends in Russia, look, we know it is expensive to dismantle this, but that cannot be the only problem you have when you will not even declare all of the chemical weapons you have, when you won't even begin the process of dismantling them, when you have signaled that you are no longer going to be complying with the bilateral destruction agreement, you consider it now inoperative, no longer useful. We want some signs from you that you are serious about dealing with chemical weapons before we enter into the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
And there is a final reason for this, Madam President. One of the leaders of Russia has written to one of the top leaders of the United States and made it clear that if Russia is to join the Chemical Weapons Convention, it wants to do so at the same time the United States does. As a result, it would be highly unfortunate if the United States went ahead and ratified this treaty before the Russian Duma did. The Russian Duma is clearly not ready to do so. This first condition, therefore, in the Helms resolution of ratification says, `Hold on, we will ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, but we will not deposit our instrument of ratification at The Hague until Russia has done the same, thus enabling us to come in at the same time.' That is all that condition says. 
It would require certification by the President that Russia is making progress, that it intends to comply, it is making progress toward complying. They don't have to demonstrate that they have complied. We think that is a reasonable condition. I guess I will state it the other way around as to this first condition, should we be supporting a treaty that we know is being breached by the country that has the largest number of chemical weapons in the world and is going to continue to be breached by that country, or should we insist on a condition that they are making progress toward complying before we buy into it? 
The second condition has to do with other states, the so-called rogue states. I will spend only a moment on this because I know my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, wants to speak at greater length about this. We know that there are a variety of rogue states that have no intention of signing on to this treaty and others that may want to sign on but know they can violate it with impunity. These chemical weapons in these countries' hands constitute a real threat to American troops. We think that if one is going to make the claim that this Chemical Weapons Convention is going to reduce the chemical weapons stocks of these rogue nations that pose a threat to the United States, the least that ought to happen is that they submit themselves to the treaty. Can't do any good if they are not members. We need to certify that some of these nations are going to be states parties before we subject ourselves to it. 
The third condition is one that I can't imagine anybody is going to object to, and that is that certain inspectors would be barred from inspecting American sites. We have the right to do this under the treaty. The President has the right to say, I don't want any inspectors from China, I don't want any inspectors from Iran coming in here because we think they are going to--and I use these as hypotheticals--the President says, we think they may be bent on industrial espionage and therefore we are going to ask that they not be inspectors. The argument against that is, well, tit for tat. They will say, fine, we don't want any Americans on the inspection team that comes into our country. We are willing to say, fine. We think for certain countries, like China and Iran, we should put right up front they are not going to be inspectors of United States facilities. 
And that would be a third condition to ratification. 
A fourth condition to--actually No. 5 on the list has to do with the standard for verification. This has to do with the question of whether or not we have an adequate sense that we can actually find cheating under the treaty. And we are not asking for an impossible standard. We are not asking for 100-percent verification. 
We are simply asking that the President certify to the Congress before we submit the articles of ratification that the CIA has certified to the President to a level of verification that will work. And what we have basically done is take the definition of previous administrations, the so-called Baker-Nitze definition, along with a specific aspect that General Shalikashvili identified as a way of identifying our standard here for verification under the treaty. 
It would be effectively verifiable. We could find violations with a high degree of confidence in a timely fashion, within a year of their occurrence. And they would be militarily significant. 
Now, militarily significant was defined in a hearing before the U.S. Congress by General Shalikashvili as 1 ton of chemical weapons. And, therefore, that is what we have built into this definition. 
So what we have said, Madam President, is that we would join the treaty at such time as we had the certification from the President that the CIA certified that we could achieve this level of verification. I do not think that is asking too much. 
Finally, the final condition has to do with articles X and XI. This is what I had spoken to before. 
I would ask my distinguished chairman if I could go on for just a few minutes here.

<TEXT>
Mr. KYL. I will conclude on articles X and XI because we are going to hear a lot more about them. I think it is important to read into the Record the provisions we are talking about and discuss in a little bit of detail specifically what our concerns are. 
Here is what article X says. I might preface this comment, Madam President, with the statement that these were inducements put into the treaty originally to induce countries to join the treaty. They were put there based upon inducements that were included in a previous treaty, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, under the so-called atoms for peace plan. 
Many people know or will remember that the atoms for peace plan was the idea that if countries would eschew the development of nuclear weapons, we would provide them peaceful nuclear technology. And countries like Iraq, and other countries that could be mentioned, took advantage of that program, and said, `Fine. We won't develop nuclear weapons. Now send us the peaceful nuclear technology.' We eventually learned that what they did with that peaceful technology was to use it in their nuclear weapons program. 
So after it was put in the treaty, and we got these people signed up, we learned that several countries were using this provision of the treaty to actually enhance their nuclear weapons capability. It worked to the detriment of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
Well, before that was ever learned this chemical weapons treaty was negotiated. So at the time it seemed like a good idea to put the same kind of provision in the chemical weapons treaty. At the time it seemed like it would be a smart thing to provide an inducement for countries to join the treaty, saying: 
If you'll join up, then we will not have any restrictions on trade in chemicals with you. You can buy all the chemicals you want. And, in addition to that, you can ask us for, and we will provide to you, all of the defensive gear, chemicals, antidotes, equipment, and so on, that will enable you to defend against chemical weapons. 
That is a pretty good incentive for a country to join up. Look at it from the standpoint of a country that has in mind conducting chemical warfare capability. The first thing they want to do is be able to protect their own troops from the use of the weapons. So they want our latest technology in defensive gear, in defensive equipment, in antidotes and the like. So it is a pretty good incentive to sign up for the treaty because they have a right to ask us, and the treaty says we will undertake to provide to them that material. Moreover they want to buy chemicals. 
Right now the Australia group I talked about before has limitations on what chemicals can be sold. As a matter of fact, there are 54 specific chemicals under the Australia group that cannot be sold to the countries we believe want to develop the chemical weapons capability. These countries then have an incentive for joining the convention because under the convention you cannot limit the trade in chemicals. 
What does the treaty say? Article X:  
Each State Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning means of protection against chemical weapons. 
It could not be more clear, Madam President. Article X says that the parties to the treaty have the right to participate in and each party undertakes to facilitate. In other words, we have an obligation to facilitate their acquisition of this defensive equipment. 
Article XI carries this further and adds another element. And I read in part: 
The . . . States Parties . . . .shall . . . undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the fullest . . . exchange of chemicals, equipment and scientific and technical information relating to the development and application of chemistry for purposes not prohibited under this Convention . . . for peaceful purposes . . . 
In other words. The `atoms for peace' equivalent in the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
So here is a big incentive for countries who want to develop a defense against chemical weapons to join the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The second part of article XI, section (c) says that: 
[The] States Parties. . . shall. . .[n]ot maintain among themselves any restrictions, including those in any international agreements . . . 
shall. . . [n]ot maintain among themselves any restrictions, including those in any international agreements, incompatible with the obligations undertaken under this Convention, which would restrict or impede trade and the development and promotion of [again] scientific and technological knowledge in the field of chemistry for industrial, agriculture, research, medical, pharmaceutical or other peaceful purposes. 
shall . . . [n]ot maintain among themselves any restrictions, [either unilateral or international restrictions.] 
So what this says is that States Parties will have the right to say, once they become parties, `You can't have an embargo on selling chemicals to us. You have to lift your restrictions.' 
For a country like Iran, for example, which has signed the treaty, this would be a pretty good deal because currently none of the Australia Group countries will sell it these chemicals. 
What is going to happen? Well, today, China may be selling chemicals to Iran or maybe another country is selling chemicals to Iran not covered by the treaty. Once the treaty goes into effect, those countries could continue to sell chemicals to Iran. But what is going to happen is that the other countries, countries that sign onto the convention are going to say, `Wait a minute. China, for example, is selling chemicals to Iran. Our chemical companies want in on the action. It says right here in the treaty we're not supposed to maintain any restrictions. So we are out of here. We are going to allow our countries to sell chemicals to a country like Iran.' We will have a very poor argument against that. 
What has been the administration's response to this? Belatedly the administration seems to find there is a little problem here. But originally it did not think so. As a matter of fact--and I think this is a critical point of this debate, Madam President,--right after the chemical weapons treaty was signed into force, the Australia Group members were all asked to begin the process of lifting their restrictions pursuant to the Chemical Weapons Convention, the plain wording of articles X and XI. 
Let me read to you, according to the administration--this is in testimony before the Congress: 
Australia Group members in August 1992 committed to review their export control measures with a view of removing them for CWC States Parties in full compliance with their own obligations under the convention. 
In other words, after the CWC was signed, the Australia Group countries began to review their export control measures which currently prohibit them from selling chemicals to certain countries, so that they could bring themselves into compliance with their obligations under articles X and XI of the convention. 
And the Australia Group itself issued a formal statement--and I am quoting now-- 
Undertaking to review, in light of the implementation of the Convention, the measures that they take to prevent the spread of chemical substances and equipment for purposes contrary to the objectives of the convention with the aim of removing such measures for the benefit of States Parties to the Convention acting in full compliance with the obligations under the Convention. 
In other words, again, if you have limitations on the sale of chemicals to countries, you are going to have to lift them or you will be in violation of articles X and XI of the convention. 
What has the administration's response to this been? 
At first it was denial. Then, one comment made to me was, `Well, we tried our best to negotiate our way out of this, but the best we could do is get language like `undertake to facilitate' rather than `obligated to.' We just couldn't 
negotiate anything better.' 
So this was a bone to those countries, an incentive for them to come in. And to our argument, this makes the situation worse, not better, and will actually proliferate these weapons, the same as Secretary Cheney just said in the quotation I just read, that articles X and XI will result in the proliferation of chemical weapons because there cannot be any restrictions. 
The administration then began to take a different tack. First they said, well, we will decide not to lift our restrictions, so the United States will still not sell to countries that we think might develop chemical weapons. And we will get you a letter to that effect. I have not seen anything in writing, but that is the administration's latest statement. 
We said, that does not do any good because it only takes one country to break an embargo. Any one of the countries could do it. And the horse would be out of the barn. So they said, well, we will try to get the other Australia Group states to agree to the same thing. 
Bear in mind what they are saying. First, they were all going to lift these restrictions to be in compliance with the treaty. Now we are going to try to convince them they should keep them in place in clear violation to the treaty. This is the way to make a moral statement, Madam President, by violating the treaty right up front and announcing to the world we are violating the treaty, by keeping in place restrictions that are required to be lifted under articles X and XI? 
It is not a very propitious way to make a moral statement or to begin the operation of an international treaty to announce in effect not only are you going to violate it but you are going to try to get all your friends in the Australia Group to violate it because not to do so would be to lift the restrictions we currently believe are helpful in preventing the spread of chemical weapons. 
Even if all these countries do decide to ignore articles X and XI, countries that are not States Parties can continue to sell these chemicals. I said, it will not be long until everyone else will want in the action. The same argument that has been made by some of our chemical companies, in the event if somebody is selling we should have the right to sell too otherwise we are just losing good business. 
So I will conclude, Madam President, by trying to make this rather simple, but I think important point. To those who say, granted, it is not going to be a very effective treaty, but at least it does no harm, I say, you are wrong. It is going to do a lot of harm--to business, to the taxpayers, to our ability to conduct diplomacy and, importantly, to our ability to constrain the spread of chemical weapons. 
As Secretary Cheney said, unless articles X and XI are removed from this treaty, it is going to make matters worse, not better. 
So the fourth condition that is a part of the Helms resolution of ratification says that we will ratify the treaty, but before we deposit the articles of ratification there has to be a certification by the President that those two sections have been removed from the treaty. Yes, of course, that will require a renegotiation. The States Parties will have to agree to take those provisions out. That should not be a problem if the administration's most current assurances are to be believed. 
I suspect, however, there are specific States Parties who do not agree with those assurances who fully intend to continue these sales. As a matter of fact, if you will read the language of the Chinese ratification, it explicitly preserves their understanding of articles X and XI which is the obvious understanding of anyone reading them, that it would be improper to have trade restrictions or to deny the defensive equipment in the case of other States Parties. 
So, Madam President, we are stuck with articles X and XI. And it is the belief of many of us that perhaps we could support this treaty if those articles were removed. But until they are removed, it makes matters worse and therefore we cannot in good conscience support the treaty in that form. 
I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for yielding me this time.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are still in the process of trying to work out the details of a unanimous-consent agreement. Part of the question is whether we can get to a vote on this matter by 3:45, or thereabouts, this afternoon. We are trying to leap to that conclusion, and in order to allow people to continue to talk about that and perhaps reach that point, I am going to begin discussing this bill now as if it were before us, so I will not have to speak later and, therefore, we will not have to use more time, hoping to be helpful in that regard. 
What we are talking about doing here this afternoon is having a couple hours of debate on a bill called the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act. The bill is S. 495. This legislation is before us because in the process of leading up to the debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention itself--which, if there is a unanimous-consent agreement, will be taken up next week--we discovered there were several things actually we could do right now, very practical, realistic steps we could take to help ameliorate the threat. Senator Hutchison from Texas has already spoken to it. Let me detail what those things are. 
It, basically, involves closing some loopholes in existing law and ensuring that the administration and the Congress work together in those ways that we can, right here at home, irrespective of whether the Chemical Weapons Convention passes or does not pass, to actually reduce this threat. One example of the kind of thing we are talking about is the fact that existing U.S. law does not make it a crime to manufacture or possess chemical weapons in the United States. If we are going to have this big debate about the chemical weapons treaty, the first thing you want to do is make sure that kind of activity is outlawed here at home. It is a provision of the law we add as a result of S. 495. 
There are several things like that in this bill, and I will go through them briefly. I want to assure my colleagues, whether you are for the Chemical Weapons Convention or opposed to the Chemical Weapons Convention, this legislation is legislation you can support. If you are against the convention, you can see this as an alternative. If you are for it, you can see it as a supplement. I am not trying to sell it as either one. I am saying these are good, practical steps we can take right now, and we should do it. 
Let me quickly go through the specifics of the provisions of the legislation. I think my colleagues will see it is exactly as we have said that it is. 
For the first time in history, we would be criminalizing the entire range of chemical weapons activities. The current law only prohibits the use or attempt or conspiracy to use chemical weapons. It does outlaw, with respect to biological weapons, the possession or manufacture. We combine the two and say that it is against the law to manufacture, to possess, to use or to conspire to use either chemical or biological weapons. So, for the first time, we contain all of those things in our criminal code, and that is against the law in the United States. That is the first thing this bill would do. 
The second thing it would do is to revoke certain export privileges of companies that violate the law. That is a commonsense proposition, and it has the additional benefit, by the way, of helping us to prevent American companies from assisting countries who we believe should not have chemicals, the precursors to making their biological or chemical weapons. 
The third section deals with sanctions against the use of chemical or biological weapons. Mr. President, today under existing law, the President of the United States is obligated to impose sanctions against countries that use chemical or biological weapons, and he is given a list of 10 sanctions that he is to impose. They are in two different tiers--five in one tier and five in another tier. He also has a waiver authority. 
What we do in this legislation is to grant him more flexibility, to keep the same sanctions, but not to have the one tier and two tier. So he can actually decide, based upon the circumstances at the time, exactly how he wants to proceed. The price for that flexibility is that we reduce somewhat his flexibility on the waiver, but he still has the ability, under the supreme-national-interest-waiver clause to waive the imposition of those sanctions should he deem it appropriate. 
Obviously, that waiver would not likely be used by a President if a country actually used chemical or biological weapons. He would, under the law today, under the law as we have it written today, want to impose sanctions. As I said, we provide more flexibility in those sanctions. 
In addition, in this section, we call on the President to block transactions of any property that is owned by a country found to have used chemical or biological weapons. In other words, just to use a hypothetical, country A uses biological or chemical weapons, and they have assets in banks in the United States. The President could block any transaction of that property, basically freeze those assets as a way of preparing to indemnify victims of the use of that chemical weapon. This is a way we can provide real, meaningful relief. This is new in law. This does not exist today. We would have a way, therefore, at 
least of providing a fund should we be able to indemnify victims of such a horrible, horrible crime. 
Another thing we do is have a section on continuation and enhancement of multilateral control regimes, which is really a fancy way of saying that we are expressing the sense of the Senate and establishing United States policy that the President continue to maintain our role in the Australia group, that group of countries that has agreed among itself not to trade chemicals to countries we believe might want to use them to create a biological or chemical weapon with them. 
We establish the policy that the President will attempt to block any attempt to substantially weaken the controls established by the Australia group. I believe that as a general proposition--this is the administration's policy anyway--I do not think that this is particularly new, but it puts into statute our policy expressing this strong position. It should, therefore, assist the President in the advocacy of that position in the Australia group meetings. 
There is another section dealing with assistance to Russia. A year ago, in the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, the Congress actually fenced, meaning it set aside the expenditure of funds under the so-called Nunn-Lugar provision for chemical- and biological-related activities. We did this because we felt there was some question about whether Russia was actually proceeding in good faith to dismantle their chemical and biological capability. As a result of the compromise that was struck by Senators Nunn and Lugar, there was actually a provision for four conditions in that legislation that had to be certified by the President prior to the release of part of these funds. 
What we have done in this legislation is to reinstate--essentially the same language that was in that 1996 defense authorization bill--and to reestablish those four conditions for certification by the President. Those conditions, as I said, are essentially the same conditions that existed before and would be certified by the President or, as was done in that defense authorization bill, the President could also release the funds if he formally certifies that he is unable to make the certification. 
So the President has total flexibility here, but at least it focuses attention on the degree of cooperation by the Russians with respect to the dismantlement of their CW and BW programs. 
The next section calls for reports on the state of chemical and biological weapons proliferation. It asks the administration to provide us an annual classified report that will enable us to better understand the threat that is out there. 
The next section would strengthen the 1925 Geneva Protocol. It is a sense of the Senate, but what it does do is urge and direct the Secretary of State to work to convene an international negotiating forum for the purpose of putting some teeth into this 1925 Geneva Protocol, which is the agreement that actually prevents or prohibits the use of chemical weapons, not just the manufacture or possession of them. 
We provide $5 million for the State Department to begin this process. 
We think this would be useful because countries of greatest concern to us, like Iran and Iraq, North Korea, Russia, China, Syria, and Libya, are all signatories to the 1925 Geneva Protocol. If we could make an international agreement that puts some teeth into that, it would be clearly useful. As I say, it is a sense of the Senate, but we believe it is useful nonetheless. 
Next it says, until the United States has developed its resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention--if it does--we would not be providing funding for that organization. 
The next section is that it is the sense of the Senate that we actually do some things to beef up our military defenses against the use of chemical or biological weapons. 
The General Accounting Office, in 1996, issued a report that was very distressing in that it reported that U.S. forces are inadequately equipped, organized, trained and exercised for operations in battlefields in which chemical and biological weapons are being used. 
So this bill recommends three specific corrective steps to deal with that and, as a result, we think, will help to actually improve and enhance our defensive capability should our forces ever be confronted with the use of these weapons. 
The last two sections, Mr. President. 
The first is relating to negative security assurances. It is a sense of the Senate that calls on the President to reevaluate the current policy of the United States on negative assurances and its impact on deterrent strategy. 
In effect, what this is all about is the following. In return for a nation's decision to join the nuclear nonproliferation treaty as a nonnuclear weapons state, the United States pledges never to threaten or use nuclear weapons against that state unless it was allied with a nuclear weapons state in aggression against the United States. 
So today, when chemical and biological threats seem like the larger concern, this negative security assurance could undermine our effective deterrence against such an attack. Would Saddam Hussein, for example, feel free to use chemical weapons if he did not think we would possibly retaliate with nuclear weapons? As a result, that is in here. 
Finally, we have the riot control agent provision which has been much spoken of. We think it is important for the rescue of downed pilots or in a situation where civilians are present that riot control agents be used. And our act provides for that. 
These are all, I would say, very helpful, very specific, very realistic provisions that constructively deal with the proliferation of this threat. As a result, we think this legislation is important. Again, as I say, whether you are pro or con on the treaty, this legislation enhances the security of the United States. I certainly request my colleagues to consider it and to support the vote, assuming we have the vote here before long.

Mr. KYL. I just want to respond to a couple of things my distinguished colleague has raised. He is certainly correct to point out the fact that in my view there has been inadequate attention paid to this entire subject. I wish we could spend a lot more time debating the Chemical Weapons Convention, as a matter of fact, but in an effort to meet the deadline imposed or that the administration has indicated it needs to meet, we have had to accordion a great deal of debate and consideration of items into a very small period of time. 
I desperately wanted to spend more time on the Chemical Weapons Convention, but in order to agree to get that done on time, we have all made some compromise agreements of how much time to take on things. That is why there is not much time taken on this legislation. The one thing I did want to assure my colleague of, and that is the portions where he sees sections having been repealed, those sections were picked up in a new title under title I, section 101, chapter 11(B) and the following. 
Essentially what was done, I assure my colleague, is the chemical and biological provisions of the code were combined and the same activities that are illegal as to one are now illegal as to both with the same penalties. So nothing was dropped from the law; it was merely consolidated in a different place. The definition of chemicals, incidentally, is the same definition that is contemplated by the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I might also note, the subject matter here has been debated and was the subject of hearings really for the last 3 years in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, by and large, and the exact language of this legislation has been aided by the FBI and others in the administration as well. 
My colleague is correct, it would be better to have more time to spend not only on this bill but on the Chemical Weapons Convention itself. In an effort to try to get all of this done under the timeframe the administration is working under, we have all made compromises. I would like a lot more time to brag about what is in this bill, but I agreed to keep my remarks to a couple minutes. 
I will not take more time at this point. I appreciate the spirit in which the comments of the Senator from Vermont were made.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have time remaining, and I am perfectly happy to yield back almost all of that time in an effort to get this matter to a vote. I urge my colleagues on the other side, if they have opposition, to please make their arguments in opposition so we can bring this to a vote and our colleagues can try to catch their airplanes, which I know they are trying to do. 
Until someone is here to speak, I will reiterate the basic point of the legislation. I do urge my colleagues who may be in opposition to please come to the floor to make their arguments to try to accommodate our colleagues. 
This legislation, again, Mr. President, is simply designed to complement the provisions of existing law and is also complementary to the Chemical Weapons Convention. It does not create a great deal that is new, but rather plugs loopholes in existing law. We noted, for example, that while it is illegal for one to manufacture and possess and use biological weapons in the United States, we have overlooked passing a law that makes it illegal to manufacture or possess chemical weapons. If we are going to be serious about the chemical weapons business and trying to prevent proliferation, obviously we need to make that conduct illegal as well. We do that in this legislation. 
It is not anything Members should have concern about. In fact, they should want that. Who would be against providing the President a little more flexibility and imposing sanctions on countries that violate international law by using chemical or biological weapons? 
Who could be against asking the President of the United States to do his best to keep the Australia group together, working as a group of countries in the world that do not sell chemicals, precursor chemicals, to nations that might make chemical weapons of them? It is the policy of the United States, and a sense of the Senate, that the President should ensure that the Australia group restrictions are not weakened in any way. That is consistent totally with the Chemical Weapons Convention. Again, I cannot imagine anyone objecting to that. 
We continue the conditions that were imposed in the 1996 defense authorization bill on aid to Russia, which is designed to help them dismantle their chemical weapons. We say they have to demonstrate reasonable progress toward that dismantlement. We pick the same language that was the subject of the Nunn-Lugar compromise in the 1996 defense authorization bill. What we have done is simply to continue that same requirement of Presidential certification of compliance by Russia, or, if all else fails, the President can certify that he cannot certify, and we still send the money to them. So it is not a condition I can imagine anyone would object to. If anything, we would want to make it stronger. 
Our legislation calls for an annual report on the state of proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, something that the Congress needs in order to work with the President in doing everything we can to stop the proliferation of these weapons. 
We ask the President to convene a group of nations to try to put some teeth into the Geneva protocol, which is the treaty that currently bans the use of chemical weapons. Like the Chemical Weapons Convention, it does not have strong teeth in it. So we are urging the President to try to get a group of nations together to try to do that. Again, I cannot imagine any opposition to that. 
We provide our military be better protected against chemical warfare. The GAO issued a report last year that found grave deficiencies in the way that our troops were being equipped and trained to deal with chemical warfare and biological warfare. That needs to be remedied, and we have three specific things in here that we think will help the Defense Department in ensuring that our troops are adequately protected. 
One of the things that we recommend, for example, is that the U.S. Army Chemical School remain under the oversight of a general officer, just to make our point that we think this is an important matter, and certainly at least a one-star general ought to be in charge of that facility and that operation. 
We provide for a fixed riot-control agent problem, Mr. President. This is the problem that has arisen because this administration has signaled an intention to change the understanding that has been in existence since President Ford's days when the opportunity to use riot-control agents, or tear gas, was said to be permitted in certain instances where it would help 
to save lives. For example, where we have a downed pilot that is being held by a group of hostile civilians, we can rescue that downed pilot, not by shooting civilians but by the use of tear gas. Where you have a group of civilians protecting someone that you want to get out, or you want to control a group of hostile prisoners of war, that kind of thing, you do not want to shoot anybody, you can do it with riot-control agents, tear gas. We want to assure that is possible under the law. 
These are the things that are the key elements of S. 495, Mr. President, and there should not be anything controversial here. It should be provisions that all of us can support. We simply identified each of these items in the course of all of the hearings and all of the debate about the Chemical Weapons Convention and found there were a lot of practical things we could do in legislation. 
Bear in mind, this legislation has to go over to the House, it has to pass the House, it has to go to the President. Therefore, there are plenty of scrubs on it, even though the Senate has not had a great deal of opportunity to debate it. 
I hope that our colleagues, if there is anyone else in opposition, will say so and we can get on with a vote on this matter pursuant to the unanimous-consent agreement. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if there are any more quorum calls, that the time be subtracted equally from both sides.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are working toward developing a unanimous-consent agreement which I hope will permit us to vote yet today on an important piece of legislation that complements the efforts of the administration to proceed with the consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention next week. 
For those who support the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is a way of reiterating that support. For those who oppose the Chemical Weapons Convention, it is a way of declaring support for a wide range of very realistic and practical and constructive steps that the United States can take to help reduce the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and, in particular, chemical and biological weapons here in the United States. 
It is my hope that we will be able to call that bill up. It is a bill which I have sponsored with cosponsorships, including I believe all of the Members of the leadership of the Senate Republicans, including the distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott; Senator Nickles; Senator Mack; Senator Coverdell; Senator Helms; Senator Shelby; Senator Hutchison; Senator Allard; Senator Hutchinson; Senator Inhofe; Senator Smith; and myself. 
It is a bill which would have, under the unanimous consent agreement being proposed, only 2 hours of debate before the vote. There would be a very limited amount of time to describe it, and, therefore, I would like to briefly describe the legislation at this time. 
I think it should be noncontroversial, though the Chemical Weapons Convention itself is very controversial; and reasonable people can fall on either side of that debate. I think the legislation before us today should be supported by all Members of the United States Senate. 
The title of the bill--or let me actually read the description of the title of the bill to begin this description: 
To provide criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful acquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical weapon or biological weapon, and to reduce the threat of acts of terrorism or armed aggression involving the use of any such weapon against the United States, its citizens, or Armed Forces, or those of any allied country . . . 
Mr. President, this legislation came about because of the focus on the Chemical Weapons Convention and the determination that there were a lot of things that the United States could and should do whether or not that convention is ratified. 
For example, we found that while it is illegal in the United States to possess or manufacture biological weapons, there is no criminal prohibition upon the manufacture or possession of chemical weapons. Therefore, we combine the two sections of the statute which relate to chemical and biological weapons and provide that it is a criminal offense to manufacture them, to use them, to threaten to use them, to possess them. All of these things are criminalized with substantial penalties being provided for them. 
We provide for the revocation of export privileges for those companies in the United States that might violate that law and, incidentally, for the forfeiture of assets to help pay victims of such crime. In effect, say, this was an attack such as in the Tokyo subway about a year ago. We would, under certain circumstances, be able to seize the assets of the criminals responsible for that for the purpose of compensating the victims of that terror. 
This legislation provides for sanctions against the use of chemical and biological weapons. Under existing law there are sanctions, but we would provide more flexibility for the President. Under the existing law, the President has a limited range of 10 sanctions that he has to impose in two particular tiers if he makes a finding that there has been a violation of law. These are sanctions against another country. 
What we would do is provide the President the flexibility to provide any combination of those sanctions. He is still required to impose five of them, as he is under current law, but this provides him some additional flexibility depending upon the circumstances of how he would impose sanctions against any particular country that has used or possesses or manufactures chemical or biological weapons. 
There is also a continuation of the waiver for the President. Although that is strengthened somewhat, he would still be able to 
waive these provisions in the supreme national interest of the United States. 
But importantly, also, this act would call the President to block transactions of any property that is owned by a country found to use chemical or biological weapons. So their property here in the United States should be seized, here again, for paying the victims of such crime. 
Another thing this bill does is to call upon the President and the Secretary of State to use their best efforts to maintain the Australia Group in force. That is the group of countries of the world that have agreed among ourselves not to trade in chemicals with countries we do not think should have those chemicals because they might be used to manufacture chemical or biological weapons. 
We need to maintain the Australia Group. This provides the sense of the Senate and the policy of the United States to continue that Australia Group in force. 
There are currently conditions on assisting Russia in the destruction of and the dismantling of their chemical and biological weapons. They have far and away the largest stocks of chemical and biological weapons in the world. What we have done is to provide assistance to them under what are called Nunn-Lugar funds. This continues the same kind of restrictions that existed in the past with respect to a certification by the President that Russia is in compliance with these requirements. 
The four conditions in this legislation closely parallel those in the 1996 Defense Authorization Act in which both Houses of Congress agreed to fence the so-called Nunn-Lugar funds pending a certification by the President that either Russia was making progress toward achieving these goals or that the President could not so certify. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent just to speak for a couple more minutes to conclude my remarks.

Mr. KYL. Thank you. 
I note the distinguished Senator from Texas is here. I will, therefore, try to stay within this limitation of time. 
In any event, this is basically a continuation of previous policy, Mr. President, not something new, but we think it is important to continue. 
Our legislation calls for a report on an annual basis on the state of chemical and biological weapons proliferation. It calls for the Secretary of State to work with other nations of the world to try to find ways to put teeth in the 1925 Geneva Protocol. That is the treaty we all signed that bans the use of chemical weapons and, by the way, includes such countries as Iran and Iraq and other countries that really ought to comply with the provisions of that treaty. 
We restrict the use of funds until the United States is actually a member of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
Next to last, we make it the policy of the United States to continue to enhance our defense capabilities. The GAO came out with a report last year that frankly said our military was going the wrong way in providing defensive capability to our troops, that we need to spend more money and that we need to do a better job in equipping our troops to defend against the use of chemical weapons. 
Because of that GAO report, we have included in this legislation instructions to the Secretary of Defense to get on with that job and, very specifically, by the way, to require that the primary facility which engages in this conduct to defend our troops is under the jurisdiction of a general officer of the United States. 
We provide a sense of the Senate that the President reevaluate the current policy on negative assurances. And, finally, we provide that the policy begun in the Ford administration on the use of riot control agents be continued in force. This is a policy that says, for example, that notwithstanding any chemical weapons convention, if we have a downed pilot, for example, and there are 
civilians in the area, we can use riot control agents, tear gas, if you will, so we do not have to fire real bullets to extricate that pilot from that situation. 
The bottom line is this act that will be introduced, and we hope voted on today, is an act that continues some very important policies and institutes some new, positive changes in the law, including filling some important gaps in the law relating to the manufacture and use of chemical weapons here in the United States. It ought to be supported by all Senators in this Chamber whether or not they intend to support the Chemical Weapons Convention. This bill is an important bill to support, and we will be calling on them later today for that support. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act which will, for the first time in U.S. history, provide criminal and civil penalties against those who produce, stockpile, or transfer chemical weapons in the United States. It will also legislate other practical and realistic reforms to reduce the spread of both chemical and biological weapons and improve the American military's defenses against them. 
The impetus for this legislation was the realization that the Chemical Weapons Convention being promoted by the administration, though noble in aim, would have little practical effect, especially in the United States; and that there were important steps we could take to fill gaps in existing law regardless of what happens with the CWC. 
That is why Senate Republicans have introduced the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, setting forth a comprehensive package of domestic and international steps to address chemical and biological threats. Importantly, the legislation reiterates our firm commitment to destroying the entire U.S. chemical weapons stockpile whether or not the CWC is ratified--a pledge no other chemical weapons state has matched. 
Some may be skeptical of this bill because they see it is as an alternative to the CWC. To the contrary, S. 495 provides a sensible and effective action plan that CWC critics and proponents alike should support. By enacting the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, the United States will lead by example, and will underscore its commitment to bringing together like-minded friends and allies to make unthinkable the resort to chemical or biological weapons. This is not going it alone, this is leadership.

Mr. KYL. Thank you. 
Mr. President, first let me thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I am glad I don't have to follow his remarks. So I am pleased to speak before he does. 
Mr. President, T.S. Eliot once wrote that `April is the cruelest month.' Of course, he was referring to the change of seasons--of `mixing memory with desire.' Millions of Americans would probably agree with Eliot about April being the cruelest month, but for a far different reason. It is, of course, on April 15 that income taxes are due. 
By midnight tonight, millions of Americans will have finally completed their income tax returns. According to estimates by the Internal Revenue Service, Americans will have spent 5.4 billion hours on tax-related paperwork. The Tax Foundation estimates that the cost of compliance will approach $200 billion. 
If that is not evidence that our Tax Code is one of the most inefficient and wasteful ever created, I do not know what is. Money and effort that could have been put to productive use solving problems in our communities, putting Americans to work, putting food on the table, or investing in the Nation's future are instead devoted to tax preparation. And that is a waste. 
It is no wonder that the American people are frustrated and angry, and that they are demanding real change in the way their Government taxes and spends. 
Mr. President, the House of Representatives is today considering a proposed constitutional amendment that represents the first step in the direction of the kind of fundamental tax reform the American people have been demanding--it would require a two-thirds majority vote of the House and Senate to approve tax increases. Why do I say that it is the kind of reform the people are demanding? Because a third of the Nation's population has now imposed such limits on their State governments, and voters have approved tax limits by wide margins. In Arizona, for example, tax limitation passed with 72 percent of the vote. In Florida, it passed with 69.2 percent of the vote; in Nevada, with 70 percent. 
The tax limitation amendment, which I introduced in January, now has 22 Senate cosponsors. It is something that was recommended by the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform. The commission, chaired by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, advocated a supermajority requirement in its report on how to achieve a simpler, single-rate tax to replace the existing maze of tax rates, deductions, exemptions, and credits that makes up the Federal income tax as we know it today. 
Here are the words of the Commission:  
The roller-coaster ride of tax policy in the past few decades has fed citizens' cynicism about the possibility of real, long-term reform, while fueling frustration with Washington. The initial optimism inspired by the low rates of the 1986 Tax Reform Act soured into disillusionment and anger when taxes subsequently were hiked two times in less than seven years. The commission believes that a two-thirds super-majority vote of Congress will earn Americans' confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of any new tax system. 
Mr. President, tax reform cannot succeed without a supermajority requirement for raising taxes. In the decade since the last attempt at comprehensive tax reform, Congress and the President have made more than 4,000 amendments to the Tax Code. Four thousand amendments. The constant changes have left taxpayers perplexed, unsure how to comply 
today, let alone how to prepare financially for the future. Without the protection of the tax limitation amendment, taxpayers will be vulnerable to further tax-rate increases, particularly if tax reform--which we all hope will occur within the next few years--eliminates many of the tax deductions, exemptions, and credits in which they find refuge today. 
Let me make a few other points about this amendment. First, the tax limitation amendment itself cuts no taxes. It does not preclude Congress from raising taxes in the future. It only raises the bar on future tax increases. 
Many people, myself included, believe that taxes are already far too high, and that we ought to cut taxes. This amendment does not do that. All it says, in effect, is `enough is enough.' It makes Congress find a way to meet its obligations without taking even more from the pockets of the American people. 
Mr. President, here are some astonishing statistics from Americans for Tax Reform. According to the organization's calculations, about 31 percent of the cost of a loaf of bread is attributable to taxes. About 54 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas goes to taxes. About 40 percent of the cost of an airline ticket is attributable to taxes, as is 43 percent of the cost of a hotel room. 
Understand that on an aggregate basis, the average family pays more in taxes than it does on food, clothing, and shelter combined. According to the Tax Foundation, Federal taxes amount to about 27 percent of the family's budget, and State and local taxes consume another 12 percent--for a total of almost 39 percent. But spending on food, clothing, and shelter totals only about 28 percent of the family budget. And families still have to find a way to pay for everything else they need--for example, medical care, transportation, education, and an occasional vacation or dinner out--out of the meager amount that is left after taxes. 
So what the tax limitation amendment says is that Government already takes far too much from hard-working Americans and should at the very least take no more, unless there is a very broad and bipartisan consensus in Congress and around the country. 
A second point. There is no small irony in the fact that it would have taken a two-thirds majority vote of the House and Senate to overcome President Clinton's veto and enact the 1995 Balanced Budget Act with its tax relief provisions. By contrast, the President's record-setting tax increase in 1993 was enacted with only a simple majority--and not even a majority of elected Senators, at that. Vice President Gore broke a tie vote of 50 to 50 to secure passage of the tax-increase bill in the Senate. 
The tax limitation amendment is based upon a simple premise--that it ought to be at least as hard to raise people's taxes as it is to cut them. What the tax limitation amendment seeks to do is force members of Congress to think of tax increases, not as a first resort, but as a last resort. 
Mr. President, I hope the House will pass the tax limitation amendment today. And if it does, I hope the Senate will take it up promptly and give the States an opportunity to consider its ratification. While there is much disagreement about whether to cut taxes and how, we should at least be able to agree that we should not raise taxes any further. I urge support for the tax limitation amendment. 
I hope we will be able to pass that amendment, and I hope we will have an opportunity thereby to ensure that more money is left in the pockets of hard-working American families rather than being sent to the Federal Government here in Washington.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for putting this order together at this propitious time to discuss tax policy in the country with April 15 looming on the horizon and Americans all over the country concerned about the amount of money we pay to the Federal Government in Federal income taxes. 
Mr. President, I have an important announcement to make. I have been authorized to announce that on tax day, April 15, the U.S. Senate will have a historic opportunity to vote on a resolution which will express the sense of the Senate that we support a requirement that Congress, the House and the Senate, be required to raise taxes with a supermajority. In other words, that we could not raise taxes with a bare majority, that it would require a two-thirds vote for a tax increase to go in effect, much like the requirement in States throughout the United States, and a very successful requirement, I might add. The full House is actually going to vote on tax day on the actual constitutional amendment. Our resolution will be a sense of the Senate in support of that same concept. Obviously, we are not prepared yet to actually vote on the constitutional amendment. 
The reason for this, Mr. President, is that the average family of four back in 1948 paid about 5 percent of its income in Federal taxes. But today that burden is about 24 percent. And, as our colleague from Minnesota just noted, if you add the State and local taxes to the mix, we are paying about 40 percent of our income in taxes to government. 
The last tax increase to pass in the Congress in 1993 was the largest in history. And, yet, it failed to even achieve a majority in the U.S. Senate. There was a tie of 50-50. President Clinton's largest tax increase in history only passed because Vice President Gore came to the Chamber and cast the deciding vote. We believe that it ought to be at least as difficult to raise taxes as it is to cut them. It is now easier, sadly, to raise taxes than it is to cut them. 
Consider this irony. This two-thirds majority would fix this problem, by the way. When we passed the balanced budget amendment of 1995, the President vetoed it. It included big tax cuts. The President vetoed it. We had to have a two-thirds majority to overcome the veto, and we couldn't do that. So it would have required a two-thirds vote for us to reduce taxes. But, as I pointed out, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country in 1993 passed without even a majority vote. 
As I said, Mr. President, we think it ought to be at least as hard to raise taxes as it is to cut them. That is why we are going to be voting on April 15 to support the principle that there should be a supermajority for Congress to raise taxes. 
The Kemp commission, appointed by the Speaker of the House and the previous majority leader of the Senate, came to this conclusion about this requirement. I am quoting: `The commission believes that a two-thirds supermajority vote of Congress will earn Americans' confidence in the longevity, predictability, and stability of any new tax system.' 
They made that point in recommending this two-thirds supermajority of both Houses of Congress to raise taxes as a key component of our tax policy. As I said, there are 14 States that currently have some form of tax limitation in effect. There was an interesting study in 1994 by the Cato Institute which found that a family of four in States with tax and expenditure limits faces estate and tax burdens that are $650 lower on average 5 years after the implementation than it would have been if the State tax growth had not been slowed. 
In other words, the people who live in States that have these supermajority requirements are better off, pay less in taxes than those States which do not have such a requirement. 
It also matters, Mr. President, how we raise or lower taxes. Or I should say, put it another way, how we increase revenues to the Treasury matters because you can increase revenue to the Treasury not by raising tax rates but actually by lowering certain tax rates. 
We all agree that lower tax rates stimulate the economy, which results in more taxable income and transactions and more revenue to the Treasury as a result. In fact, the tax cuts out of the early 1980's make this point. They spawned the longest peacetime economic expansion in our Nation's history. 
Revenues to the Treasury, the Federal Treasury, increased as a result from $599 billion in fiscal year 1981 to $990 billion in fiscal year 1989, up about 65 percent. 
On the other hand, higher tax rates discourage work and production and savings and investment so there is ultimately less economic activity to tax. That is exactly what Martin Feldstein, the former Chairman of the President's Council on Economic Advisers, found when he looked at the effect of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase. He found that taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal tax rates imposed by the Clinton tax bill by reducing their taxable incomes by nearly $25 billion. They did that by saving less, investing less, and creating fewer jobs, and the economy eventually paid the price in terms of slower growth. 
In other words, as I said, how Congress raises taxes is more important than how much it can tax. The key is whether tax policy fosters economic growth and opportunity. And that is why we believe, as I said before, that it ought to be more difficult to raise tax rates. It ought to be just as easy to cut taxes. We should raise tax rates only if there is enough consensus on that to provide a two-thirds majority of both Houses of Congress. 
So on April 15, tax day, all of us in the Senate will have the opportunity to go on record to tell our constituents where we stand. Do we believe that it ought to be just as difficult to raise taxes as it is to cut them? We will have the opportunity to vote on the principle of requiring a supermajority in Congress to raise taxes. And I certainly hope that my colleagues will support us in that vote. 
I thank the Senator from Wyoming for this time.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act of 1997. I am pleased to sponsor this bill, which directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for those who purposefully defraud vulnerable members of our society and those who cross international borders to evade prosecution. I thank Senator Reid for his sponsorship of this bill, and his leadership in combating telemarketing fraud. 
Current penalties for this crime are not tough enough to deter the problem and they leave the victims without restitution. Penalties for bank, wire, radio, and television fraud are at least two-thirds higher than the penalty for telemarketing fraud. Too often, telemarketing fraud felons receive a sentence of fewer than 5 years in prison. The toughest penalty to date is 10 years. These are small penalties considering that many telemarketing fraud criminals have stolen the life savings of retired senior citizens. 
Mr. President, thousands of Americans lose billions of dollars a year from telemarketing fraud. According to Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran, Jr., telemarketing fraud is probably the fastest growing illegal activity in this country. An Associated Press story reported that top prosecutors in Arizona and 9 other States filed lawsuits or took other legal action against more than 70 telemarketers nationwide 2 years ago in an attempt to crack down on fraud that costs consumers more than $40 billion a year. 
Senior citizens appear to be the most vulnerable to chicanery of this kind. Fred Schulte, an investigating editor for the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel and an expert on telemarketing fraud, has pointed out that senior citizens are often too polite or too lonely not to listen to the voice on the other end of the line. The risk of being taken advantage of, I believe, increases with age. According to Attorney General Reno, it is not uncommon for senior citizens to receive as many as five or more high-pressure phone calls a day. 
As one telemarketing con man who has worked all over the country put it: `people are so lonely, so tired of life, they can't wait for the phone to ring. It's worth the $300 to $400 to them to think that they got a friend. That's what you play on.' Mr. President, malicious criminal activity like this must be punished appropriately. 
These criminals prey on the vulnerable of our society. In one case, Nevada authorities arrested a Las Vegas telemarketer on a charge of attempted theft. The telemarketer was accused of trying to persuade a 92-year-old Kansas man who had been fraudulently declared the winner of $100,000 to send $1,900 by Western Union in advance to collect his prize. Another example: a Maine company showed real telemarketing creativity. For $250, the so-called Consumer Advocate Group offered to help consumers recover money lost to fraudulent telemarketers--but it provided no services, according to Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle, who sued the Maine firm plus four other telemarketers. 
Mr. President, the Association of Attorneys General has supported similar consumer 
protection efforts in the past. As Minnesota Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III put it last year: `In the hands of a con artist, a phone is an assault weapon.' 
I would, at this time, like to highlight one specific provision of the bill. Section 2 requires that an offender forfeit any real or personal property derived from proceeds obtained as a result of the offense. The proceeds shall be used, as determined by the Attorney General, for the national information hotline established under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The proceeds of the fraud will be returned to help the victims. I believe that it is important to pay attention to victims' rights in this area. 
Last year, more than 400 individuals were arrested by law-enforcement officials working on Operation Senior Sentinel. Retired law-enforcement officers and volunteers, recruited by AARP, went undercover to record sales pitches from dishonest telemarketers. Volunteers from the 2-year-long Operation Senior Sentinel discovered various telemarketing schemes. Some people were victimized by phony charities or investment schemes. Others were taken in by so-called premium promotions in which people were guaranteed one of four or five valuable prizes but were induced to buy an overpriced product in exchange for a cheap prize. One of the most vicious scams preyed on those who had already lost money. Some telemarketers charged a substantial fee to recover money for those who had been victimized previously--and proceeded to renege on the promised assistance. By the time the dust settled, it took the Justice Department, the FBI, the FTC, a dozen U.S. attorneys and State attorneys general, the Postal Service, the IRS, and the Secret Service to arrest over 400 telemarketers in five States, including my home State of Arizona. 
Clearly telemarketing fraud is on the rise. It is estimated that 8 out of 10 households are targets for telemarketing scams that bilk us of up to $40 billion annually. The telemarketing industry rakes in more than $600 billion in annual sales. There are many seniors in my State and across the country who must be protected against this type of fraudulent activity. That is why I have sponsored this bill. The House of Representatives passed a bill similar to mine in the 104th Congress, which has been reintroduced during this Congress by Representative Goodlatte. It already has 47 cosponsors and the support of the 60 Plus Association and the National Consumers League. I urge my colleagues to join us and cosponsor the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with increasing frequency, criminals are using the Social Security numbers and other personal information of law-abiding citizens to assume their identity and take their money. Identity fraud can be more serious than a criminal picking someone's pocket and lifting cash or a credit card. Identity theft involves criminals--who may have ties with international criminal syndicates--obtaining enough information on another person that they can open up new credit card accounts in the law-abiding person's name. Some call identity theft high-technology bank robbery. But law-enforcement officials say committing identity fraud is easier than robbing a bank. 
Identity fraud is one of the fastest growing financial crimes. An alarming 2,000 cases occur each week. Credit-card fraud losses--the major financial loss in personal-identity thefts--may amount to as much as $2 billion a year. 
The statistics don't reveal the hardship these crimes can cause. Imagine the anxiety of knowing that a criminal has been able to gain hold of your most personal identification information to open credit cards or apply for loans in your name. Even when fraudulent charges are cleared from a victim's financial records, he or she cannot be sure that the perpetrator of the crime won't strike again. Moreover, thousands can be spent to repair a tarnished credit rating. As the victim attempts to untangle the mess caused by an identity thief, phone service may be disconnected or a victim may face difficulty in securing a mortgage. 
I would like to discuss the case of a constituent, Bob Hartle, who has spent many hours working with my staff on the identity-theft proposal. Mr. Hartle served as the inspiration for an Arizona State law which, like the bill I am introducing, makes it a felony to steal another person's identity. I thank Mr. Hartle for all of his help. 
Bob Hartle's experience with an identity thief illustrates the seriousness of these crimes. The man who victimized Mr. Hartle was sentenced to 17 months in Federal prison for using false names--not Mr. Hartle's; the criminal had misappropriated other law-abiding citizens' names--in order to buy a gun and open up a credit card account. The criminal possessed enough information to have a driver's license and credit cards issued in Mr. Hartle's name. With these credit cards, the criminal made purchases under Mr. Hartle's name that exceeded $100,000. While trashing Mr. Hartle's credit, and carrying a license as Mr. Hartle in his wallet, the identity thief was busy committing serious crimes. Mr. Hartle has spent over $10,000 trying to clear his good name and credit. He did not receive a restitution payment. The assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case was quoted in a 1995 news story as saying that, `Hartle may never get his full share from the courts. * * * All we can do is prosecute this under the powers given to us by law.' 
Restitution was not available to him because, although many of the actions attendant upon identity theft do violate Federal law--that is, credit card fraud, using false names--the actual assumption of another's identity does not. Consequently, individual victims of these offenses are not entitled to restitution. 
The criminal who ripped off Mr. Hartle's identity committed several such crimes throughout the United States before he was finally apprehended. Acting alone, he caused great damage and hardship. But a new breed of identity-fraud criminal has emerged that poses an even greater threat to citizens. Sophisticated international criminal syndicates, some of which have penetrated the Social Security Administration and other agencies or companies with access to private personal information, are engaging in identity-fraud scams of a magnitude unimaginable a few years ago. 
For example, the New York Post reported on December 29 that `A brazen city-based ring of con artists has been lifting personal information about hundreds of New Yorkers and using it to get credit cards and run up huge bills.' This ring of Nigerian nationals applies for credit cards with banks `after snatching identifying data about unsuspecting victims.' Identity-fraud syndicates such as these obtain Social Security numbers and other personal information to perpetrate their scams in myriad ways: stealing mail; collecting credit-card receipts; running license plates through DMV records; posing as a loan officer and ordering a credit report; purchasing information from corrupt governmental and private employees with access to personal information. 
One of the reasons I elected to chair the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information was to ensure that the law keep pace with technology. The Secret Service, which is responsible for investigating financial fraud crimes, believes Federal fraud laws could be improved, to better protect people like Mr. Hartle, and I thank the agency for all of its help in drafting the bill. Rather than amend the Federal fraud laws, my proposal creates a separate statute for identity-fraud offenses, which I am told will make this crime easier to investigate and prosecute. When the fraud laws were drafted, the law-enforcement community was contending with counterfeiters who manufactured, distributed, and used ID's that were pieces of paper. Identity-fraud schemes were not nearly as prevalent in that pre-electronic era as they are today. 
As mentioned above, individual victims of fraud offenses--who, like Mr. Hartle, are generally not eligible for restitution under current law--could receive restitution under my proposal. Additionally, the act allows law enforcement to seize equipment--contraband--used to produce false documents. Penalties are scaled to reflect the number of victims, not just the dollar amount of the fraud. 
Moreover, the proposal requires the Secret Service to collect statistics on identity fraud offenses. Statistics on identity fraud are rough; we need to know more about the extent of the problem. 
And finally, the bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission to conduct a comprehensive study of: the nature, extent, and causes of identity fraud; the threat posed by identity fraud to financial institutions and payment systems; and the threat to consumer safety and privacy. The results of the study will be submitted to Congress with specific recommendations for legislation to address the problem of identity theft. This study is very important. Access to confidential information facilitates credit-card identity assumption scams. With identity fraud rising, we must continually reevaluate statutes regulating consumer privacy. 
This is the other side of the coin when it comes to deterring this kind of fraud. We need to go after criminal activity when it occurs, but we also must prevent the careless circulation of personal information to begin with. 
In fact, action has already been taken by Congress to better protect private identity information. In September, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 goes into effect to restrict release and use of certain personal information from State motor vehicle records. Other efforts are underway. In August, the FTC--responding to suggestions that Social Security numbers were easily available on the Internet--held a staff meeting to exchange information on consumer identity fraud, and following the meeting suggested that Congress consider legislation to tighten restrictions on the release of private identity information. 
The bill I am introducing today is targeted at the criminals: those who perpetrate identity theft crimes. Congress will need to consider other measures seeking the assistance of the custodians of personal identity information to make identity theft crimes more difficult to commit. I believe that my bill represents a solid first effort to combat identity theft, and I request that my colleagues support the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today we will vote on one of the most difficult issues facing our Nation: the illegal drug trade in Mexico and the United States. The resolution we will vote on requires the President to report by September 1, 1997, on the efforts of Mexico and the United States to achieve results in combating the production of and trafficking in illicit drugs. I support the resolution, and am hopeful that the report will show significant progress by Mexico and the United States in fighting the war on illegal drugs. 
As my colleagues have discussed today, we cannot win the war on drugs unless Mexico achieves significant progress in the areas of drug trafficking, extradition, corruption among Mexican law enforcement and other officials, interdiction networks, implementation of laws and regulations to combat money laundering, eradication of crops destined for illegal drug use in the United States, and the strengthening of bilateral border control. 
Border control must also be a top priority of the United States; and while my colleagues, including Senators Coverdell, Feinstein, and Hutchison, have done an excellent job detailing what must be done to further our and Mexico's efforts to fight illegal drugs, I want to concentrate for a moment on the need for additional United States Border Patrol agents. 
First, I am pleased that one of three things we are asking the President to do by September 1 is detail the progress made in the deployment of 1,000 additional U.S. Border Patrol agents in 1997 as required by my amendment to the Immigration Act of 1996. 
Without an effectively controlled border, the United States cannot even begin to win the war on drugs. I was disturbed that the President's fiscal year 1997 budget to Congress requested the addition of only 500 Border Patrol agents, instead of the 1,000 required in the 1986 Act. Senators McCain, Gramm, Hutchison, and Domenici recently joined me in sending a letter to the President, urging him to comply with the law, revise his budget request, and deploy 1,000 additional agents in 1997. Without an adequate contingent of customs and border agents, the problem of individuals smuggling drugs and illegal immigrants across our border will only worsen. 
Border Patrol agents are on the front lines every day, working hard to seal off our borders from increasing levels of illegal immigration and the drug trade. The agents that Congress has added over the past few years have made a difference, but the need for additional agents keeps growing. Drug and illegal alien smuggling continues to grow--illegal immigrants are expected to increase by 275,000 per year over the next several years--and the effects of illegal drugs, particularly methamphetamine, have been devastating for the citizens of Arizona and the rest of the Nation. 
Just a few weeks ago, a study on drug use in America showed a large increase in youth drug use over the last 5 years. Arizona fared poorly, with much higher drug use than the national average, including a startling statistic that our sixth graders are twice as likely to have tried methamphetamine than high school seniors nationwide. While we continue to talk about the need to fight illegal drugs, the precursor chemicals that make methamphetamine are being smuggled into Arizona in increasing volume. It must stop. 
As the resolution we are voting on today says, the abuse of illicit drugs results in at least 14,000 deaths per year in the United States, and `exacts economic costs in excess of $67 billion per year to the American people.' 
Although many of us would like to see more specific actions that the Mexican government should take to show serious improvement in the war against illicit drugs, it is my hope that Mexico will be able to show significant accomplishments in the areas outlined in the resolution. Likewise, the administration must be able to show specific, detailed action in the war against drugs by, among other things, deploying 1,000 additional agents in 1997. 
Mr. President, not rhetoric, but actions. That is what we must demand of Mexico and that is what we must demand of ourselves. We must work diligently to eradicate the scourge of illegal drugs that has taken so many of our citizens, young and old alike, hostage. This compromise resolution should be passed by the U.S. Senate.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Crime Prevention Act of 1997. One of the most important responsibilities for the 105th Congress is to pass a tough comprehensive crime measure that will restore law and order to America's streets. Reported crime may have decreased slightly over the past few years, but the streets are still too dangerous. Too many Americans are afraid to go out for fear of being robbed, assaulted, or murdered. In fact, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics report `Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims,' approximately 2 million people are injured a year as a result of violent crime. Of those who are injured, more than half require some level of medical treatment and nearly a quarter receive treatment in a hospital emergency room or require hospitalization.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Cellular Telephone Protection Act, which would improve the ability of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute individuals engaged in the activity of cloning cellular phones. Law enforcement officials and wireless carriers support the bill as an important tool to stem this kind of telecommunications fraud. 
Cell phones are manufactured with an embedded electronic serial number [ESN], which is transmitted to gain access to the telecommunications network. Those involved in cloning cell phones sit in parked cars outside of airports or along busy roadways to harvest ESN's from legitimate cell phone users and, in a process known as cloning, use software and equipment to insert the stolen numbers into other cell phones, the clones. A single ESN can be implanted into several cloned phones. The cloned phones charge to the account of the lawful, unsuspecting user. Cellular phone carriers must absorb these losses, which, according to the Cellular Telecommunication Industry Association, amounted to about $650 million in 1995, up from $480 million in 1994. The cellular industry is expanding by about 40 percent a year; efforts to combat fraud are imperative to ensure the integrity of our communications network. 
Cloning is more than an inconvenience to the 36 million Americans who currently use cellular phone services, and an expense to wireless communication companies who pay for the fraudulent calls. According to the Secret Service, which is the primary Federal agency responsible for investigating telecommunications fraud, cloning abets organized criminal enterprises that use cellular telephones as their preferred method of communication. Cloned phones are extremely popular among drug traffickers and gang members, who oftentimes employ several cloned phones to evade detection by law enforcement. When not selling cloned phones to drug dealers and ruthless street gangs, cloners set up corner-side calling shops where individuals pay a nominal fee to call anywhere in the world on a replicated phone, or simply purchase the illegal phone for a flat amount. 
The cellular telephone protection bill clarifies that there is no lawful purpose to posses, produce or sell hardware, known as copycat boxes, or software used for cloning a cellular phone or its ESN. Such equipment and software are easy to obtainn--advertisements hawking cloning equipment appear in computer magazines and on the Internet. There is no legitimate purpose for cloning software and equipment, save for law enforcement and telecommunication service providers using it to improve fraud detection. The bill strikes at the heart of the cloning paraphernalia market by eliminating the requirement for prosecutors to prove that the person selling copycat boxes or cloning software programs intended to defraud. The bill retains an exception for law enforcement to possess otherwise unlawful cloning software, and adds a similar exception for telecommunications service providers. 
Moreover, the Cellular Phone Protection Act expands the definition of `scanning receivers,' equipment which, unlike cloning software and devices, does have legitimate uses if not used to scan frequencies assigned to wireless communications. The bill clarifies that the definition of scanning receivers encompasses devices that can be used to intercept ESN's even if they are not capable of receiving the voice channel. As mentioned above, criminals harvest 
ESN's by employing scanners near busy thoroughfares. The revised definition of scanning receiver will ensure that these devices are unlawful when used with an intent to defraud just like scanners that intercept voice. 
Finally, the bill increases penalties for those engaged in cloning. A new paradigm is needed for penalizing cloning offenses. Currently, penalties for cloning crimes are based on the monetary loss a carrier suffers, not the potential loss. First-time offenders oftentimes do not face any jail time, which makes these cases unattractive for prosecution. Carriers and law enforcement are forced to choose between keeping the cloner on the telecommunications network to rack up high losses to ensure jail time, or stemming the losses sooner only to have the cloner back on the streets in days. The penalty scheme should be revised to track another indicator of cloning fraud--the number of electronic serial numbers stolen. 
Cloning offenses are serious crimes, and the penalties should reflect this. We know that cloned phones are used to facilitate other crimes--particularly drug trafficking. Additionally, cloning offenses are serious economic crimes in themselves that threaten the integrity of the public communications network. In August, two individuals in New York were arrested for allegedly possessing 80,000 electronic serial numbers. Each of the 80,000 ESN's could be implanted into several cloned phones. I look forward to working with the U.S. Sentencing Commission to achieve a more appropriate sentencing structure for cloning fraud. 
The cellular phone protection initiative will help to reduce telecommunications fraud. In the process, other criminal activity will be made more difficult to conduct--cloned phones, now a staple of criminal syndicates, would not be so readily available. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I introduce the Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act, which would require Federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate a visit for medical attention. The fee would be deposited in the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. Each time a prisoner pays to heal himself, he will be paying to heal a victim. 
Most working, law-abiding Americans are required to pay a copayment fee when they seek medical care. It is time to impose this requirement on Federal prisoners. 
To date, at least 20 States--including my home State of Arizona--have implemented statewide prisoner health care copayment programs. In addition to Arizona, the following States have enacted this reform: California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, Utah, Virginia, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Several other States are expected to soon institute a copayment system, including, Alaska, Connecticut, Maine, Montana, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming. 
Moreover, according to the National Sheriffs' Association, at least 25 States--some of which have not adopted medical copayment reform on a statewide basis--have jail systems that impose a copayment. 
In June, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care held a conference that examined the statewide fee-for-service programs. At the conference, Dr. Ron Waldron of the Federal Bureau of Prisons provided a survey of some of the States that have adopted inmate medical copayment programs and concluded that `Inmate user fees programs appear to reduce utilization, and do generate modest revenues.' 
Dr. Waldron reported that prison copayment laws resulted in the reduction of medical utilization of: between 16 and 29 percent in Florida; between 30 and 50 percent in Kansas; 40 percent in Maryland; 50 percent in Nevada; and between 10 and 18 percent in Oklahoma. Terry Stewart, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, notes that, `Over the life of the [Arizona copayment] program, there has been an overall reduction of about 31 percent in the number of requests for health care services. This strongly suggests that inmates are being more discreet about, and giving more considered thought to, their need for medical attention.' I will have his letter placed in the Congressional Record. 
Reducing frivolous medical visits saves taxpayers money. A December 28, 1996, New York Post editorial, `Toward Healthier Prison Budgets,' which I will also include in the Record, reported that the copayment law in New Jersey allowed the State to cut its prison health care budget by $17 million. 
As to generating revenue, Dr. Waldron reported that California collects about $60,000 per month in prisoner-copayment fees. In my home State of Arizona, the State has collected about $400,000 since the inception of the program in October 1994. 
Not only are inmate copayment plans working well on the statewide level, they are achieving success in jail systems across the United States. In the January-February edition of Sheriff, the National Sheriffs' Association President reported that copayment plans--which, as mentioned above, are operational in jail systems in at least 25 States--have: First, discouraged overuse of service; and second, freed health care staff to provide better care to inmates who truly need medical attention. Yavapai County sheriff, G.C. `Buck' Buchanan, in a letter that I will include in the Record, writes: `Prior to the institution of [copayment reform], many inmates in custody were taking advantage of the health care which, or course, must be provided to them. This could be construed as frivolous requests if you will, and took up the valuable time of our health care providers * * *. Since this policy has been in effect, we have realized a reduction in inmate requests for medical services between 45 to 50 percent.' 
The success of the prison and jail fee-for-service initiatives should come as no surprise. Common sense says that inmates will be less likely to seek unnecessary medical attention if they are required to pick up part of the tab. 
I believe that Congress should follow the lead of the States and provide the Federal Bureau of Prisons with the authority to charge Federal inmates a nominal fee for elective health care visits. The Federal system is particularly ripe for reform. According to the 1996 Corrections Yearbook, the system spends more per inmate on health care than any State except Vermont. Federal inmate health care totaled $327 million in fiscal year 1996, up from $138 million in fiscal year 1990. Average cost per inmate has increased over 60 percent during this period, from $2,204 to $3,549. 
The Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act provides that the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall assess and collect a fee of not less than $3 and not more than $5 for each qualified health care visit. The term `qualified health care visit' does not include any health care visit that is: Conducted during the intake process; an annual examination; initiated by the health care staff of the Bureau of Prisons; the direct result of a referral made by a prison official; or an emergency visit. Prisoners who are pregnant or determined to be seriously mentally ill are exempted from the copayment requirement altogether. No prisoner shall be denied treatment on the basis of insolvency. 
The act also gives the Director of the Bureau of Prisons the authority to set by regulation a reasonable fee, not to exceed $5, for prescriptions, emergency visits, and juvenile visits. And the legislation permits the Director to charge an inmate's account for medical treatment for injuries an inmate inflicts on himself or others. 
As I mentioned above, all fees will be deposited in the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. 
Before I conclude, I would like to thank the Arizona Department of Corrections for its assistance in helping me draft this reform. Additionally, I appreciate the assistance that Sheriff Buchanan and his office provided me. 
I look forward to working with the Department of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to implement a fee-for-medical-services program--a sensible and overdue reform--for Federal prisoners.

Mr. KYL. Thank you, Madam President. First, let me associate myself with the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Alabama who has just spoken. 
My position is quite the same as his with respect to this nominee. Certainly, I must begin by saying that I believe Mr. Garland is well qualified for the court of appeals. He earned degrees from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and clerked for Judge Friendly on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and for Justice Brennan on the Supreme Court and, since 1993, he has worked for the Department of Justice. So there is no question, he is qualified to serve on the court. 
Like my colleague from Alabama, my colleague from Iowa, and others, I believe that the 12th seat on this circuit does not need to be filled and am quite skeptical that the 11th seat, the seat to which Mr. Garland has been nominated, needs to be filled either. The case against filling the 12th seat is very compelling, and it also makes me question the need to fill the 11th seat. 
In the fall of 1995, the Courts Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the caseloads of the D.C. circuit. Judge Silberman, who has served on the D.C. circuit for the past 11 years, testified that most members of the D.C. circuit have come to think of the D.C. circuit as a de facto court of 11. In other words, even though there are 12 seats, theoretically, it is really being thought of as an 11-member court by its members. In fact, in response to written questions, Judge Silberman pointed out that the courtroom, normally used for en banc hearings, seats only 11 judges. In other words, that is what they can accommodate. 
When Congress created the 12th judgeship in 1984, Congress may have thought that the D.C. circuit's caseload would continue to rise, as it had for the previous decade. But, in fact, as my colleague from Alabama has pointed out, exactly the opposite has occurred; the caseload has dropped. It is the only circuit in the Nation with fewer new cases filed now than in 1985. During the entire period, the D.C. circuit has had a full complement of 12 judges for only 1 year. 
In a letter to Senator Grassley, Judge Silberman wrote that the D.C. circuit can easily schedule its upcoming arguments with 11 judges and remain quite current. Further, Judge Silberman noted that while the D.C. circuit, unlike most others, has not had any senior judges available to sit with it, the court has invited visiting judges only on those occasions when it was down to 10 active judges. 
Additionally, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, it costs more than $800,000 a year to pay for a circuit judge and the elements associated with that judge's work. In light of recent efforts to curtail Federal spending, again, I agree with my colleague from Alabama that it is imprudent to spend such a sum of money unless the need is very clear. 
Senators Grassley and Sessions have made sound arguments that the D.C. circuit does not need to fill the 11th seat. Their arguments are reasonable and not based upon partisan considerations. Similarly, my concerns with the Garland nomination are based strictly on the caseload requirements of the circuit, not on partisanship or the qualifications of the nominee. 
I would not want the opposition to the nomination, therefore, to be considered partisan in any way. Thus, although I do not believe that the administration has met its burden of showing that the 11th seat needs to be filled, in the spirit of cooperation, and to get the nominee to the floor of the Senate, I voted to favorably report the nomination of Merrick Garland from the Judiciary Committee when we voted on that a couple of weeks ago. But, at the time, I reserved the right to oppose filling that 11th vacancy when the full Senate considered the nomination. That time has now come, and being fully persuaded by the arguments made by Senator Sessions and Senator Grassley, I reluctantly will vote against the confirmation of this nominee. 
Based on the hearing of the Courts Subcommittee, caseload statistics, and other information, as I said, I have concluded that the D.C. circuit does not need 12 judges and does not, at this point, need 11 judges. Therefore, I will vote against the nomination of Merrick Garland. 
If Mr. Garland is confirmed and another vacancy occurs, thereby opening up the 11th seat again, I plan to vote against filling the seat--and, of course, the 12th seat--unless there is a significant increase in the caseload or some other extraordinary circumstance. 
Madam President, I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership in this area, as chairman of the subcommittee, and for allowing me to speak prior to his comments, which I gather will be delivered next. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1997. It will outlaw gambling on the Internet. I believe it will protect children from logging on to the Internet and being exposed to activities that are normally prohibited to them. And for those people with a gambling problem, my bill will make it harder to gamble away the family paycheck. 
Gambling erodes values of hard work, sacrifice, and personal responsibility. Although the social costs of gambling are difficult to quantify, research indicates they are potentially staggering. Gambling is a growing industry in the United States, with revenues approaching $550 billion last year--three times the revenues of General Motors Corp. In 1993, more Americans visited casinos than attended a major league baseball game. 
The problem can only grow worse with online casinos. Now it is no longer necessary to go to a casino or store where lottery tickets are sold. Anyone with a computer and a modem will have access to a casino: Internet users can access hundreds of sites for blackjack, craps, roulette, and sports betting. Gambling addiction is already on the rise. Online gambling will only increase the problem. 
Why is this bill necessary? It dispels any ambiguity by making clear that all betting, including sports betting, is illegal. Currently, nonsports betting is interpreted as legal. The bill also clarifies the definition of bets and wagers. This ensures that those who are gambling cannot circumvent the law. For example, virtual gaming businesses have been known to offer prizes instead of money, in an attempt to evade the law. 
Additionally, my bill clarifies that Internet access providers are covered by the law. As the National Association of Attorneys General [NAAG] task force on Internet Gambling reported, `this is currently the most important section to State and local law enforcement agencies, because it provides a civil enforcement mechanism.' FCC-regulated carriers notified by any State or local law enforcement agency of the illegal nature of a site are required to discontinue services to the malfeasor. NAAG believes that this can be a very effective deterrent. The bill includes interactive computer-service providers among those entities required to discontinue such service upon notice. Federal, State, and local law enforcement entities are explicitly authorized to seek prospective injunctive relief against continued use of a communications facility for purposes of gambling. 
The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act makes explicit the intent of Congress to create extraterritorial jurisdiction regarding Internet gambling activities. Too often, illicit operators of virtual casinos set up shop in friendly jurisdictions beyond the direct application of U.S. law. It will also require the DOJ to report on the difficulties associated with enforcing the statute. Finally, it places some burden on the bettor. 
The Internet has great potential to promote both educational opportunities and business expansion in this country. At the same time, the Internet is fast becoming a place where inappropriate activities such as gambling, pornography, and consumer fraud thrive. Recently, many businesses have welcomed law enforcement's involvement in cracking down on consumer fraud. We must find a constitutional way to deal with the other problems raised by this revolution in communications. I believe that it is possible to impose some conditions, as we have in other areas, without violating free speech rights. 
There is growing support for changes to current law. As I mentioned, the NAAG has a task force on Internet gambling, and the report of the task force--authored by Attorneys General Dan Lungren and Hubert Humphrey--called for a legislative remedy to stem the tide of gambling electronically. NAAG has endorsed my bill. 
Mr. President, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1997 ensures that the law will keep pace with technology and keep gambling off the Internet. I urge my colleagues to pass the bill.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the State Housing Protection Act. I thank Senator Faircloth for his leadership on this issue and joining in sponsoring this bill. This bill prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] from enforcing a complaint of discrimination on the basis of a housing provider's occupancy standard, and thereby, transfers from HUD to the States the authority to set occupancy standards. 
Mr. President, in July 1995, HUD General Counsel Diaz issued a memorandum which, in effect, tried to supplant the traditional two-per-bedroom occupancy standard, and could have forced housing owners to accept six, seven, eight, or even nine people in a two-bedroom apartment. HUD should not be establishing national occupancy standards. 
In 1995, Senator Faircloth and I blocked HUD from imposing national occupancy standards until it completed an official rule. Soon thereafter, along with Representative McCollum, we introduced our bill to permanently transfer authority back to the States. The House passed it as part of its public housing reform bill, but it died in the conference committee late last year. 
By pursuing a policy that encourages overcrowding, thereby depreciating housing stock that is scarce to begin with, HUD is poorly serving lower income families and defeating its own charter. Our bill will help correct the problem. It is supported by the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, the Council of Larger Public Housing Authorities, the Multi Housing Institute, the National Apartment Association, the National Assisted Housing Management Association, the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, the National Leased Housing Association, the National Multi Housing Council, and the Public Housing Authorities Directors Association. 
Several States have an occupancy standard; the one in my own home State of Arizona has worked well. The intrusion of a Federal bureaucracy often does more harm than good. That is why Senator Faircloth and I have reintroduced this bill. I urge my colleagues to join us and cosponsor it.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today, I voted in favor of Federico PenAE6a to be the new Secretary of Energy for the Clinton administration in the sincere hope that he will be able to provide the Department of Energy with the leadership and direction it needs to provide the proper stewardship of our national energy and security needs in the 21st century. 
I have addressed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with my grave concerns about the current direction of the Department of Energy, especially with respect to the maintenance and stewardship of our nuclear weapons complex. I wish to use this forum, and the occasion of the Senate vote on Federico PenAE6a, to restate my concerns and to reiterate my hope that the current trend at the Department of Energy will be reversed. 
Of particular concern has been former Secretary Hazel O'Leary's technically insupportable insistence that the United States can both maintain a credible nuclear deterrent and permanently forego nuclear testing. What is more, her lack of familiarity with the critical work of the Nation's nuclear weapons laboratories appears to have emboldened her to exert immense pressure on their directors to abandon the labs' longstanding view that the nuclear stockpile cannot be certified without periodic underground testing. 
Indeed, the nuclear weapons complex that the next Secretary of Energy will inherit from former Secretary Hazel O'Leary is a shadow of its former self, thanks in no small measure to a Clinton administration policy which the distinguished chairman of the House National Security Committee, Representatives Floyd Spence, has called erosion by design. In releasing a study of this reckless policy on October 30, 1996, Representative Spence observed that: 
`The past four years have witnessed the dramatic decline of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and the uniquely skilled workforce that is responsible for maintaining our nuclear deterrent. The Administration's laissez-faire approach to stewardship of the nuclear stockpile, within the broader context of its support for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, is clearly threatening the Nation's long-term ability to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile. * * * In my mind, it's no longer a question of the Administration's `benign neglect' of our Nation's nuclear forces, but instead, a compelling case can be made that is a matter of 'erosion by design.' 
Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed in Representative Spence's study about the implications of the Clinton-O'Leary program for denuclearizing the United States. In this regard, two portions of the Spence report deserve special attention. 
Stockpile stewardship: 
The Clinton Administration's Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program [SSMP] entails significant technological risks and uncertainties. Certification that U.S. nuclear weapons are safe and reliable--in the context of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty--depends on developing highly advanced scientific diagnostic tools that do not yet exist and may not work as advertised. Funding shortfalls, legal challenges and other problems are almost certain to continue to impede progress in achieving the program's ambitious goals, and raise serious doubts about the ability of the program to serve as an effective substitute for nuclear testing. The Administration's commitment to implementing the SSMP and, more broadly, to maintaining the U.S. nuclear stockpile is called into question by DOE's failure to adequately fund the SSMP and to conduct important experiments. 
Dismantling the DOE weapons complex: 
Unprecedented reductions and disruptive reorganizations in the nuclear weapons scientific and industrial base have compromised the ability to maintain a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile. The cessation of nuclear-related production and manufacturing activities has resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and critical capabilities * * *. DOE still lacks concrete plans for resuming the production of tritium * * *. Unlike Russia or China, the United States no longer retains the capacity for large-scale plutonium `pit' production and DOE's plans to reconstitute such a capacity may be inadequate.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Senate's role in confirming judges. 
The ninth circuit is enormous. It spans nine states and two territories covering 1.4 million square miles. It serves a population of more than 45 million people; the next largest, the sixth circuit, serves fewer than 29 million people, and every other Federal circuit serves fewer than 24 million. By 2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the population of the ninth circuit will be more than 63 million--a 40-percent increase in just 15 years. Given the demographic trends in our country, it is clear that the population of the States in the ninth circuit, and thus the caseload of the Federal judiciary sitting in those States, will continue to increase at a rate significantly ahead of most other regions of the country. 
To serve its enormous population, the ninth circuit already has 28 judgeships, making it by far the largest circuit--and, in fact, larger than the first U.S. Senate. The next largest circuit, the fifth circuit, has 17 judgeships, while the first circuit has six and the seventh and eighth each have 11. The average number of judgeships in the Federal circuits other than the ninth is 12.6. Further, the ninth circuit has requested an additional nine judgeships, which would take it to 37 active judges, in addition to senior judges. 
Unfortunately, too often the decisions reached by this circuit have had to be reversed on appeal. According to statistics published in the National Law Journal, in the last six terms of the U.S. Supreme Court--from the 1990-91 term to the 1995-96 term--the Supreme Court reversal rate for the ninth circuit was 73 percent, 69 of 94 cases were reversed. The average reversal rate for the other circuits was 61 percent, 268 of 442. And so far this term, the high court has overturned 10 of the 11 ninth circuit cases it has reviewed. Since circuit judges are simply supposed to apply the law enunciated by the Supreme Court, the obvious question is why the ninth circuit gets it wrong almost three-fourths of the time the Supreme Court reviews its decisions. 
Consider, for example, the 11 decisions handed down by the Supreme Court on February 18 and 19. Three of the eleven decisions reviewed ninth circuit cases. In all three cases, the ninth circuit was in conflict with other circuits. In fact, in one case, the ninth circuit disagreed with five other circuits. In all three cases, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the ninth circuit. 
Such decisive reversals are not an aberration. Most recently, on March 3, in a unanimous decision by Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court reversed an en banc ninth circuit decision that Arizona could not require State employees to speak only English on the job. The Supreme Court ordered a State employee's challenge to Arizona's English-only constitutional amendment to be dismissed as moot because the worker resigned 7 years ago. The high court castigated the ninth circuit. As the New York Times, March 4, 1997, stated, `Justice Ginsburg was pointed in her criticism of how * * * the Ninth Circuit * * * handled this case.' For example, Justice Ginsburg wrote, `The ninth circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did.' Previous opinions have been even more damning. 
The Supreme Court is able to review only a small number of the ninth circuit's decisions. Thus, in all but a tiny fraction of cases, the ninth circuit is the court of last resort for more than 45 million Americans. To have so many subject to a circuit that so often errs should concern us. 
Some have attributed the ninth circuit reversal rate to the unwieldy size of the bench. Others point to a history of judicial activism, sometimes in pursuit of political results. I suspect there is more than one reason for the problem. Whatever the case, the Senate will need to be especially sensitive to this problem when it provides its advise and consent on nominations to fill court vacancies. The nominees will need to demonstrate exceptional ability and objectivity. The Senate will obviously have an easier time evaluating candidates who have a record on a lower court bench. Such records are often good indications of whether a judge is--or is likely to be--a judicial activist, and whether he or she is frequently reversed. Nominees who do not have a judicial background or who have a more political background may be more difficult to evaluate. 
As President Clinton noted in response to Senator Dole's criticism--of `activist' judges--in the last campaign, the Senate has as much responsibility as the President for those who end up being confirmed. We need to take that responsibility seriously --among other things, to begin the process of reducing the reversal rate of our largest circuit.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it now appears that the balanced budget amendment will pass or fail by a single vote. If the amendment is defeated, I would venture that there is a greater chance that UFO's will land on Earth tomorrow than there is that the Federal Government will actually balance its books by the year 2002. It is unlikely that Congress and the President will ever balance the budget without a constitutional requirement to do so. 
Two years ago, President Clinton vetoed a balanced budget--the first balanced budget to pass Congress in 26 years. Not one Senate Democrat voted for the plan. And of course, since it would have taken 67 votes in the Senate to override the President's veto, the balanced budget never became law. 
President Clinton now says he has changed his mind--that he is for a balanced budget, but once again his support is conditional: we have to wait until after he leaves office to make 98.5 percent of the savings required to get there. Until then, it is business as usual. The President would create six new entitlement programs, costing at least $60 billion over the next 5 years. He would have us increase total Federal outlays by $827 billion over that period. We can do all this, yet somehow the deficit magically disappears in 2002. 
I am reminded of the old Peanuts cartoon when Lucy promises time and again to hold the football still for Charlie Brown, only to pull it away at the last minute. Every Republican Senator will vote for this amendment. A few Democrats will vote for it, too. An overwhelming majority of the American people want us to pass it. Yet President Clinton and most Senate Democrats ask us to trust them--they do not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
How do we know that, in 3 or 4 years, when it finally comes time to get serious about deficit reduction under the Clinton budget, they will not yank away their support for a balanced budget again? 
Mr. President, we must pass the balanced budget amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Hatch was called away for a moment. I would like to present some of the remarks he would make in opposition to the amendment. 
Of course, nothing in Senate Joint Resolution 1 prevents us from running surpluses or saving those surpluses in a rainy day fund. But Senate Joint Resolution 1 does put a lock on savings to ensure that they are not spent frivolously. 
The proposal before us is based upon the argument that, under the balanced budget amendment, previously accumulated surpluses cannot be drawn upon in future years without a three-fifths vote. This is because, the argument goes, such funds would be spent as current outlays within the meaning of section 7, but would not count as current receipts and would therefore cause outlays to exceed receipts and trigger the three-fifths vote in section 1. Thus, this proposal seeks to prevent the use of previously accumulated surplus funds by a simple majority vote. 
While most of us are concerned with how to stop running deficits, this proposal exhibits concern about accumulated surpluses. Protecting accumulated surpluses with a three-fifths vote is not necessarily a flaw in the amendment, however. On the contrary, I see it as a strength. Requiring a supermajority to spend previously accumulated surpluses could help us ensure that they are not frittered away on enticing, but fundamentally unimportant, spending projects. 
Let us be realistic, Mr. President, we have had 28 straight years of deficits, and we have run deficits for 58 of the last 66 years. If we adopt the balanced budget amendment, we all believe that deficits will come to an end. I do not expect it will be easy to accumulate large surpluses, even under the balanced budget amendment. Proper planning and discipline can yield positive results. But I think it's important that we jealously guard the fruits of our budgetary labors and protect the surpluses we have managed to acquire, if any. 
This amendment seeks to make it easier to spend away any surpluses we manage to acquire. It seems to me that this is an ill-advised policy. We would be wiser to keep the surplus in the strongbox of subject it to a supermajority requirement to be certain that it is not whisked away in yet another Washington spending frenzy. Can we safely assume that the Congress would leave money sitting, unguarded, on the table? 
The supermajority requirement will help us ensure that when a real emergency arises, the surplus will be there to meet truly pressing and worthy needs. Both common sense and political reality dictate that there will be very little difficulty in getting the three-fifths necessary because, after all, who would vote against emergency aid when there would be no increase in the deficit? 
I do have a concern that allowing Congress the option of spending a portion of the national savings by simple legislative fiat might erode the effectiveness of the balanced budget amendment by relaxing the fiscal constraints on yearly spending. Congress might slip into a habit of spending accumulated surpluses with regularity and get used to spending beyond our annual income, just as we have gotten into the habit of borrowing under the current system. Then having wasted our savings, we would have much more work just to get back into annual balance habits. 
If we were fortunate enough to accumulate a sizable surplus, I expect we could stop patting ourselves on the back for simply not increasing the debt and actually start to repay some of the huge debt this country has run up. This is probably the best use of surpluses, particularly from a cash management perspective, and is what is contemplated as the normal use of surpluses under the 
balanced budget amendment. 
That is why Senate Joint Resolution 1 does not count repayment of debt principal as total outlays. As we pay down our debt, we will continue to free up capital, lower interest rates and our annual interest payments, and strengthen the economy, helping us avoid deficits and the need to draw on savings or to borrow. We would also be moving ourselves away from the debt ceiling and building a cushion of debt availability if we should have to borrow again. 
One final point, Mr. President. We have not balanced the budget in almost 30 years, as I have said before. It is perhaps a bit premature to start arguing about how we will spend surpluses. The first order of business is to pass the balanced budget amendment and get the deficit at least to zero. Then I submit that we can work on surpluses and true debt reduction. 
This is an interesting proposal, but it ought to be defeated.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Wisconsin and will respond briefly to them. 
First of all, I think it is important to note that the Feingold amendment, as I understand it, does not just apply to any potential surplus in the Social Security trust fund but would apply to any surplus. I think that is a correct interpretation. 
I go back to the comments I made a moment ago to reiterate that it ought to be more difficult to spend the surplus, first of all, because we could easily get into the habit of saying, `Well, we have a few dollars here in surplus. Let's quickly go out and spend it,' and, second, because we are not going to eliminate the 
debt or even begin to repay the debt if we do not apply surpluses to the debt. 
But as to the argument that this would apply as well to the Social Security trust fund, I think several comments are in order to the extent, if that is true, that it is true. First of all, of course, one could always run a surplus in the rest of the budget as a unified budget to cover the cost that the Senator from Wisconsin is talking about. In any event, this three-fifths vote requirement, so-called supermajority, is necessary to protect the Social Security trust fund from being raided to ensure that it is used for its true purposes. We are running a surplus today. We ought not to make it easier for Congress to continue to raid that surplus and spend it on other things. 
If there is any criticism that I get--and I get plenty when I visit with seniors out in Arizona--it is the criticism of the Congress and the President raiding the Social Security trust fund. They ask, `Why are you spending that on other Government things when it is intended to be spent on Social Security?' And, of course, they are absolutely right. We should not be. We ought to make that as hard to do as possible. That is one of the reasons that we are supporting the balanced budget amendment because we recognize that if we do not balance the budget, if we do not begin to set priorities in other spending programs, the temptation is always there to continue to raid the Social Security trust fund. 
So, ironically, the whole purpose here, or at least a significant part of the purpose, of the balanced budget amendment is to protect the Social Security trust fund. We ought to make it harder to raid that trust fund. 
I suppose one could postulate the situation in which we are at a point when we have to draw upon the IOU's that are in the Social Security trust fund, even for Social Security purposes. And I do not think that there is anybody in the House or the Senate who would argue that, in that circumstance, it would be very difficult to get the three-fifths vote. I mean no politician, nobody here in Washington, DC, is going to say, `No, we don't think we will fund Social Security this year.' That is the one obligation that all of us take as kind of our first rule. And, obviously, no one would be able to face the folks back home if we didn't do that, and we should not. We have that obligation. We owe that obligation, and it would be done. 
We have provided a supermajority in here for other kinds of emergency situations, and we have said those are clearly situations in which, if it is necessary, you could get 60 votes in the Senate, and three-fifths in the House, as well. 
I daresay, if we ever got to that eventuality, even if this applied to that situation, it would not be difficult to get the 60 votes necessary. 
So it seems to me that, as I said before, we are really worried about something here that isn't going to happen. I would much rather focus our attention on getting the budget in balance than to worry about what is going to happen after we do that and we start to run surpluses. I think that will be a wonderful day, if we ever get there. I do not think we will have trouble figuring out how to spend the extra money, and I would rather make it difficult to spend it so we can make sure that at least part of that begins to go to pay our national debt. 
I would be happy to stop at this point, if the Senator from Wisconsin has any other thoughts to engage in this debate further.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from Wisconsin, I am a little bit confused about the last point he made. Perhaps he could clarify this. Was the Senator from Wisconsin suggesting that if we might want to cut taxes because we have a surplus of funds unassociated with Social Security, it would require a 60-vote majority? Or was the Senator from Wisconsin assuming that the surplus that he described was the IOU's in the Social Security trust fund?

<TEXT>
Mr. KYL. In that event, Mr. President, I do not understand the argument of the Senator from Wisconsin, because we are not going to need 60 votes simply to reduce taxes. If we have a surplus, then the revenues that would be lost theoretically from a reduction in taxes would have to be offset. But there is no requirement in that case that there be a supermajority to cut taxes. The revenue that would result that would show up in subsequent years would be required to be taken into account in order to determine whether we had a balanced budget and whether we needed to reduce expenditures in subsequent years. But at the time that we would make the decision to cut taxes, there would not be a requirement for a 60-vote majority. 
To the other point that the Senator made, asking the question with regard to the Social Security trust fund, that I was somehow suggesting that we only honor our obligation when we have a surplus, I do not understand that either because, of course, that was not my point. That is not the fact. 
We have an obligation to our Social Security recipients, our 
retirees, that has to be satisfied regardless of whether the Social Security trust fund is in surplus or in deficit. That is a solemn commitment that we all understand and we are prepared to meet. 
Over the last several years, we have been building up a surplus theoretically, so we are in the situation now where there is a surplus. We are meeting the obligations. That is not at issue. We have to satisfy our obligations to our seniors. In the event that we begin to run a deficit, that obligation would have to be satisfied, as I described before. Nobody in this body or the other body is going to contend that somehow the balanced budget amendment is going to preclude us from doing that. It is an expenditure that is probably the first expenditure we will want to make around here. My guess is that there might be a bridge here or special subsidy there that might fall by the wayside, but Social Security payments are not going to fall by the wayside. 
In fact, again, unless we balance the budget, Social Security, along with everything else, is in jeopardy. Most of us, I think, would undoubtedly agree with the Senator from Wisconsin that Social Security is one of the very first obligations we are going to have to meet, and, therefore, it is probably not in jeopardy. I think we would all contend under no circumstances would we ever allow it to be in jeopardy. It is going to be other programs. 
But I would rather be in a position to say we can fund all the things that we would like to fund that are necessary to fund. If we do not get our budget in balance, we are not going to have that ability. There will come a time when there is not enough money to spend on key things like law enforcement and national defense and critical programs because our debt will have gotten so high that the interest payments on the debt are eating up the largest part of our budget. 
We have to get to the point where we are not running deficits anymore, our annual deficits are zero, but we can begin to pay down the national debt. That is why we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
I think perhaps the best illustration of this is to look at the budget that the President presented to us just a couple of weeks ago. It is an amazing document because while the President purports to demonstrate that we can reach a balanced budget in 5 years, and therefore we do not need to pass the balanced budget amendment, his budget demonstrates precisely the opposite. It proves that you cannot get here from there unless you are required to do so by the Constitution. How so? Apart from the fact that the Congressional Budget Office says it is not in balance by somewhere between $50 and $70 billion--leave that aside--the President proposes that most of the savings that would be required to get into balance are in the last 2 years of the 5-year period--incidentally, after he is no longer President. Seventy-five percent of the savings would have to be made in the last 2 years, fully 47 percent in the last year--almost half of all the savings over a 5-year period. 
Now, what does that mean? Our budget deficit last year was $107.9 billion. We are going to go up to something like, I don't know, $126 billion this next year and $127 billion the year after that. We are supposed to be getting to zero. 
I had an old rancher friend tell me once if you are in a hole and you want to get out, the first thing you do is stop digging. This President would not stop digging until the very end and then magically, somehow or other, after he is long gone, we are going to ratchet up the courage to make all kinds of savings that we cannot decide to make in this year or the next year or the year after that. It is a little bit like the fellow who swears he is going to go on a diet; he has to lose 30 pounds. So he says, all right, I am going to do it by July 4. I am going to lose 30 pounds. First, however, I am going to eat like heck and gain another 20 pounds. And then, by golly, on July 1 I am going to start losing and by July 4 it will all be gone. 
It is not going to happen. That is why you need the discipline of the balanced budget amendment to force us to set the priorities so that we can achieve a zero deficit within 5 years, stop the accumulation of additional debt, which requires us to pay more interest on the debt, which eats up moneys that could be spent on education, on the environment, on defense, on law enforcement, on any number of things--on Social Security. As I said, I mean all of us around here will agree Social Security comes first. So we really do not have to worry about Social Security. But we ought to be worrying about all of these other things because many of them are important just like Social Security is. And there is not going to be enough money for them if we do not get this budget in balance. That will not happen, as the President's own budget illustrates very clearly, until we have the discipline of a mandatory requirement under the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. 
So, again, I think this is where we really ought to be focusing right now. We can worry about how we are going to spend the surpluses if and when we ever get there. For now I would just be pleased to get to the point of zero. That is what is going to be required if we are going to be in balance, and that means we have to pass the balanced budget amendment.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a couple of the minutes we have remaining here. Let me reiterate. We are talking about two things here. One, we are talking about accumulated surpluses that don't have anything to do with Social Security. The point I made on behalf of Chairman Hatch is, if we ever get to that wonderful point, I don't think we will have any trouble figuring out how to spend that money. In fact, a lot of us would like to make it a little harder to spend so we can begin applying it to deficit reduction. So I am not concerned if it requires us to get 60 votes here to do that. 
Folks watching, of course, may appreciate that it takes 60 votes to do most things here in the U.S. Senate because a 40-vote minority can always filibuster. In order to break that filibuster and actually bring something to a vote here you have to have 60 votes. This is about the only body that I know of where a Member cannot call the question and automatically get a vote. We cannot get a vote in this body unless there is unanimous consent or 60 Members agree. So there is a 60-vote requirement to do a lot of things around here. Again, I am not too worried about getting a 60-vote requirement to spend surplus money in the U.S. Treasury. I suspect that will be a pretty easy thing to do. 
As to the matter of Social Security, again I think all of us are united in our concern. I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for his concern about Social Security recipients, and I know Chairman Hatch and all the Members on this side have the same concern. Again, I am not at all concerned that Members here would somehow slight Social Security recipients. They are going to be the first obligation that we satisfy. 
But, as I said, there is not going to be enough money for any of these things if we don't get the budget in balance. 
Mr. President, at this point I yield any additional time I have. 
I move to table the Feingold amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to just raise one of the questions that rises under the Kennedy amendment, to ask the Senator from Massachusetts to respond to what I think is a real dilemma that is created. I presume it is an unintentional consequence, but it is the kind of thing that we have to be very careful of because, obviously, we are amending the Constitution here. We need to be very, very careful we do not do something wrong or something that would have a consequence that would be undesirable. 
The Senator from Massachusetts referred to the Nunn amendment from last year, which most Members of the Senate supported, and essentially compared his amendment to the Nunn amendment. There are a couple of subtle differences which makes a big difference between the Senator's amendment and the Nunn amendment. 
The Nunn amendment from last year provided that absent specific legislative authority, judicial review by the courts would not be possible, that is to say, `The courts would not have jurisdiction for claims arising under the balanced budget amendment.' And that was the language, `for claims arising under the balanced budget amendment.' The Senator's amendment, however, provides and adds specific legislation and authorizes judicial review: `Congress shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions' under the balanced budget amendment so that the courts would have no enforcement role. 
Let me repeat that in a moment here. Then I will provide a hypothetical which illustrates why that is not a good thing. 
The courts would have no enforcement role--that includes, of course, the right to protect a citizen who is acting under the Constitution in conformance with his constitutional rights and, therefore, would be denied the protection of the court. Could such a situation arise? Yes. 
The Kennedy amendment allows Congress unconstitutionally to raise taxes by use of a voice vote and no court can hold the tax unconstitutional. The balanced budget amendment requires raising taxes by rollcall vote. That, of course, means that we all have to cast our vote when our name is called. It is a written record, that each one go on record. And that is for a reason, of course. But if the Congress were to raise taxes by a voice vote, in violation of that constitutional amendment, citizens would be in a quandary of whether or not they could raise the question of the unconstitutionality of the imposition of a tax in defense when they are prosecuted for failure to pay the tax. 
The Nunn amendment did not have this draconian effect. Under the Nunn amendment, any taxpayer could raise as a defense the argument that the Congress passed an unconstitutional tax. The Kennedy amendment forecloses that debate by precluding court action by providing that the exclusive enforcement is by the Congress. So Senator Kennedy's amendment would allow the Government effectively to imprison taxpayers for refusing to pay an unconstitutional tax. 
Of course, that is an unintended consequence of the Kennedy amendment, but it is a consequence. And it is one of the reasons why we should not adopt the Kennedy amendment. 
One of the reasons why it is so hard to amend the Constitution is that we want to be absolutely certain that everything we have done will withstand the scrutiny of time and the Constitution. That is why we have a lot of hearings and debates, and perhaps one of the reasons why an amendment which comes to the floor for the first time for debate has not had the kind of hearings that would illustrate the problems with the amendment. That is an important part of our process here. 
The Nunn amendment went through that process. It was thoroughly debated and was approved. The Kennedy amendment, by making a very slight change in the Nunn amendment, raises a very serious constitutional question, and it is one of the reasons why 
I would not be able to vote for the Kennedy amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. President.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senate has had before it several amendments that include provisions their proponents say will exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. I do not doubt the Senators who propose the amendments are sincere in their desire to protect Social Security; none of us wants to harm Social Security, which is so important to so many older Americans. I have to say, though, that well-intentioned as their amendment may be, I cannot think of a greater threat to Social Security. 
Consider for a moment what it would mean to exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. In effect, Social Security would become the only Federal program--the only program--where deficits would be permitted. The rest of the Federal budget would be required to be in balance. 
How on earth does allowing Social Security to be in deficit protect our seniors? Quite the opposite. If a balanced budget is good for other programs, why is it not good for Social Security? There is no greater protection for seniors than having the money to take care of our obligations. In fact, we have been able to provide for seniors precisely because Social Security has usually been in balance or surplus; it is the rest of the budget that has been plagued by big, chronic deficits. 
Now, at the very time it appears we are near consensus about how detrimental deficits are, some are proposing that we allow deficits to begin to infect the retirement program. In fact, the amendments to exempt Social Security would establish a constitutional presumption that Social Security will be run in deficit. Why else would the program be exempt from a balanced budget requirement? 
Mr. President, we have always made sure that Social Security is actuarially sound. When Social Security faced problems back in the early 1980's, Republicans and Democrats came together in a bipartisan way to rescue the program and make sure that the benefits of current retirees were protected and paid on time. 
On a bipartisan basis, we have abided by rules in the Senate that make it virtually impossible to pass a budget that adversely affects the Social Security surplus; it would take a supermajority vote to pass such a thing. On a bipartisan basis, we made sure that Social Security was exempt from the across-the-board spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law in the 1980's. The Republican budgets of the last 2 years proposed ways of achieving balance without touching Social Security, and I assume President Clinton's new budget will not touch Social Security, either. 
So the reality is that Republicans and Democrats have worked together every step of the way to protect the integrity of the Social Security system. 
Why? Because there is general consensus in the country that Social Security must be protected. It has broad bipartisan support in Congress and around the country. It is supported by people young and old, rich and poor. It works. And unlike other programs run by our Government, it works because we have made sure that it has always operated in balance or with a surplus to cover unforeseen circumstances or expected future needs. That commitment 
to sound budgeting would be upheld by the balanced budget amendment--and applied to the rest of the budget as well. 
Mr. President, I want to speak for a few moments about what I believe are some of the misperceptions about the balanced budget amendment and the Social Security exemption that is being proposed. 
First, there is nothing in the balanced budget amendment that requires cuts in Social Security benefits. In fact, the budgets that Congress passed during the last 2 years would have achieved balance without touching Social Security, so obviously it can be done without harming the retirement system. 
Second, there is nothing in the exemption that is being proposed that would prevent Congress from cutting retirement benefits, means-testing benefits, reducing cost-of-living adjustments, or raising payroll taxes. The exemption would not prevent the expenditure of Social Security funds for other purposes; in fact, it would do just the opposite. Given that the exemption would allow Social Security to run a deficit, Congress will in all likelihood simply shift spending that cannot be accommodated within a balanced budget to the Social Security budget. 
Since Social Security is a program defined in statute--and Congress can amend that statute at any time by simple majority vote--Congress would be free to call virtually anything Social Security--whether it be Medicare, Medicaid, education, infrastructure development, or welfare--and thereby extend the exemption to cover those programs, too. The incentive would be to raid the trust funds for any project or program that might otherwise bust the Federal budget, and that would endanger the solvency of what today constitutes the Social Security Program. It would also mean that a provision of the Constitution could be amended by a simple majority vote--by just amending the statute that is referred to in the constitutional exemption. That, of course, would directly contradict the amendment clause of the Constitution itself. 
Third, there is nothing in the exemption that precludes the Social Security surplus from being invested in Government securities and, in turn, being used to cover general operating expenses, just as it is now. Even those using Social Security as a pretext for opposing a balanced budget know that Congress has always made sure that the debt to the Social Security trust fund has been repaid--repaid with interest. 
Mr. President, the fact that the Social Security surplus is invested in government securities and used for general operating expenses does not mean beneficiaries are being shortchanged of any benefits due them. The surpluses do not exist for current retirees, but to help cover the cost of benefits when the baby-boom generation retires years down the road. 
So, the only relevant question regarding the safety and soundness of Social Security is whether, when it comes time to pay those benefits to future retirees, the Federal government will be able to cover its IOU's to the Social Security trust fund. That, in turn, depends on how deeply in debt the Federal government is. 
Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office projected just last month that the budget deficit will reverse course and begin to rise again--from $107 billion in 1996 to $124 billion in 1997--and it will keep rising to $278 billion in 2007. Debt held by the public will increase 55 percent in just the next 10 years. The more debt that accumulates, the harder it will be for the Government to repay Social Security in the future while also meeting all of the Nation's other needs--for example, in law enforcement, education, the environment, and health care. The balanced budget amendment will help minimize the accumulation of debt 
and the threat to future retirees that is inherent in it. 
If Congress does not balance the budget--if it does not constrain the national debt--the temptation will ultimately be to monetize the debt--that is, pay it off by printing more money. And that would lead to rampant inflation. No industrialized nation has ever reached the level of debt that our country is expected to face in the next century without monetizing the debt, printing more money, and experiencing destructive, rampant inflation. 
If inflation drives the cost of basic goods and services beyond the reach of most Americans--if, for example, bread costs $100 a loaf--it will not matter that a retiree's $1,000 Social Security check arrives promptly in the mail. The worst enemy of those on fixed incomes is inflation. 
So the exemption neither guards against cuts in benefits nor ensures that the government has the ability to repay its debts to the trust fund to cover future benefits. It is a false promise to the millions of Americans who depend on Social Security to meet their most basic of needs. 
Leaving Social Security under the balanced budget amendment will, however, make sure that the retirement system remains safe, sound, and balanced. And that is important because, while the system is running annual surpluses now, it will soon begin running huge deficits. Beginning in 2012, Social Security will begin spending more than it collects in payroll taxes. By 2029, benefits will amount to more than all payroll tax revenue, accumulated surpluses, and interest--meaning that the trust fund will have neither sufficient income nor savings to meet then-current obligations. If allowed to continue operating in deficit, the Social Security Program will rack up $7 trillion in debt by 2070. These deficits are the greatest threat to the Social Security system. 
Mr. President, the exemption will not protect benefits or guarantee repayment of IOU's to cover future benefits. It will not even ensure that Social Security surpluses are invested in something other than government IOU's. But it will make it far more difficult to balance the rest of the budget by not allowing the amounts invested in Government securities to be counted toward a balanced budget. 
That would mean Congress would have to cut spending, raise taxes, or both by an additional $706 billion over the 5-year period 2002 through 2007 beyond what would be necessary to balance a unified budget. 
The exclusion would force deep spending cuts--an additional across-the-board reduction of 10 percent--in education, the environment, Medicare, law enforcement, and other discretionary spending programs. Or, it would require huge tax increases--up to 12 percent higher than they are today. 
To put that into perspective, President Clinton's 1993 tax increase amounted to $241 billion. Last year's congressional budget resolution proposed slower Medicare-spending growth to provide savings of $158 billion, and discretionary spending savings totalling $291 billion. 
The $706 billion in additional deficit reduction that would be required by the Social Security exemption would amount to more than the Clinton tax increase and those two sources of savings combined. It would obviously be very difficult to find any consensus for such huge reductions, and therein lies the rub. I am very concerned that the Social Security issue--that older Americans--are being made the scapegoats for a vote against the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, if proponents of the exemption are serious about wanting to balance the budget, excluding Social Security, then they should lay out how they will deal with tomorrow's Social Security deficit as well as how they intend to cover the $706 billion gap in the short term. 
Or they should simply admit that they do not support a balanced Federal budget.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this week, the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on two measures related to international family planning. One, House Joint Resolution 36, which is supported by the Clinton administration, would release population control funds on March 1, instead of July 1. The funding could not be meted out any faster than 8 percent of the total appropriated for fiscal year 1997 per month--a limitation recommended by the President's Chief of Staff last year. But the funds could be made available to groups that provide abortions or lobby in support of more liberal abortion policies abroad. 
The alternative measure--the so-called Smith-Oberstar bill, H.R. 581--would provide for the immediate release of all fiscal year 1997 population control funds, subject to conditions that would preclude their use for abortion-related activities. In other words, Smith-Oberstar would ensure that the funds are used for what we all say is intended here--family planning, not abortion. 
I would point out that both measures passed the House of Representatives on February 13. But the Smith-Oberstar bill, which passed that Chamber with more votes than the President's proposal, would make about $170 million more available for the population control program than would President Clinton's plan. And, as I just noted, it would guarantee that the funds are used for their intended purpose--family planning--not for abortion or lobbying in support of more liberal abortion policies abroad. It would reinstate the Mexico City policy, a policy initiated by the Reagan administration at the 1984 U.N. conference in Mexico City, attaching certain conditions to the way foreign organizations can use the American people's hard-earned tax money. 
Mr. President, there were two main conditions associated with the Mexico City policy. First, an Agency for International Development [AID] grantee, getting U.S. tax money for family planning overseas, could not be involved in abortion, even with its own resources. 
Second, that grantee could not lobby or pressure foreign governments on the abortion issue. 
At the crux of this debate is a simple question: Why did President Reagan establish those conditions for receipt of American tax dollars? Once we understand the answer to that question, we can get this debate into its proper focus. 
Let us start with this fundamental principle: Any nongovernmental grantee of the United States abroad--which includes, of course, all the organizations that receive U.S. population assistance funds--is, in effect, an agent of the United States. 
It does not matter how the group puts its own money to use. What matters is that, when we give them American dollars, we give them our seal of approval, too. An AID grant confers more than just funds. It bestows respectability, standing, and clout. It is, in effect, an official endorsement. 
And that is why, for decades, we have always imposed all sorts of restrictions and requirements upon AID grantees. We do so in recognition of the fact that money is fungible. Give a million dollars to an organization, and you free up a million dollars of its own money for other activities. 
Far more important though, we all understand that an AID grant marks an organization as acceptable, ideologically and ethically, to the United States. 
Back in 1984, President Reagan saw that AID grants to groups involved in abortion overseas presented an ethical dilemma. Yes, it was their own money they were using to perform or promote abortion. But every dollar they got from American taxpayers freed up another dollar for their abortion-related work. 
President Reagan understood that the international community viewed those abortion groups as quasi-official agents of the U.S. Government. And for good reason. Private organizations, having the imprimatur of taxpayer funding, could well be viewed by foreign leaders as speaking on behalf of the U.S. Government about abortion-related policies. 
In fact, some AID grantees openly ran pro-abortion lobbying campaigns, with their own resources of course, in countries where abortion was not legal. 
Their money, freed up by AID grants, gave them access to local media and local officials. In country after country, they ran sophisticated--and effective--campaigns in favor of abortion. 
And they are still doing it. The tiny island nation of Mauritius is an example of the worldwide effort being waged by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. This is what IPPF said in its own report on activities in Mauritius: 
As a direct result of the advocacy campaign, the policy climate in Mauritius has changed favourably . . . The MFPA (Mauritius Family Planning Association, a member of the IPPF) is determined to maintain the momentum, and sees its role more stimulating as it contributes to the wave of change. 
There is a fundamental issue here: Should funds be earmarked for family planning as intended, or should taxpayers be required to fund lobbying activities with which they might 
disagree? While there is general consensus in favor of family planning, most people do not believe tax dollars should be used for lobbying activities. 
Back in 1984, President Reagan did not like the idea of our grantees pressuring foreign governments--particularly with the appearance of an official endorsement by the government of the United States. 
That is why he made a distinction, in his Mexico City white paper, between what foreign governments do with their money, and what our grantees do with their money. 
Foreign governments that might be involved in abortion would not be seen as agents of the United States, but AID grantees would be seen in that light. 
So in his Mexico City policy, President Reagan gave AID's population grantees a choice. If they wanted to remain eligible for future grants, they would have to promise not to get involved with abortion or abortion lobbying overseas, even with their own money. 
And the program worked very effectively with that kind of policy in place. While the Mexico City policy was in effect, the program provided funds to about 400 organizations worldwide, accounting for nearly half of the combined pool of family planning funds made available by donor nations. And as I recall, the amount of money appropriated for international family planning rose considerably during the Reagan-Bush years. 
Only two grantees--albeit two very powerful grantees--chose to put abortion advocacy ahead of their commitment to family planning. Their involvement in abortion was apparently so deep that they were willing to cripple the family planning work of even some of their own affiliates that were willing to accept the Mexico City conditions during those years. 
So when we are told today that the Mexico City policy--like the provisions of the House-passed Smith-Oberstar bill--would wreck international family planning, we need only look back on past experience to see what effect it really had. 
Mr. President, past experience tells us that almost every AID population grantee would put its commitment to family planning head of its involvement in, and lobbying for, abortion. Only one or two would not. 
This country's approach to international family planning is seen around the world as part of our foreign policy. And those few grantees that are zealous in their support for abortion should not be allowed to call the shots for what is really an arm of American foreign policy. 
So the question the Senate faces this week is not how much money the AID population account will get in March or in July. The question is whether, as a matter of American foreign policy, the prestige of the American Government and the resources of the American people should support family planning on the one hand, or a worldwide campaign for abortion on demand on the other. 
If that issue had been better understood when the House of Representatives voted on this matter earlier this month, the President's resolution might not have been approved. 
Mr. President, I want to conclude by quoting President Reagan, when he first enunciated the Mexico City policy in the early 1980's. He said:  
The basic objective of all U.S. assistance, including population programs, is the betterment of the human condition--improving the quality of life of mothers and children, of families, and of communities for generations to come. For we recognize that people are the ultimate resources--but this means happy and healthy children, growing up with education, finding productive work as young adults, and able to develop their full mental and physical potential. 
That goal should not be held hostage to the Clinton administration's demand that we fund groups involved in abortion and in abortion lobbying. Fortunately, we do have an alternative, as embodied in the Smith-Oberstar bill. That is the legislation the Senate should vote to send to the President this week.

Mr. KYL. If we are going to get back to the old policy--a successful policy that ensured funds were made available promptly and used for population assistance as intended--we need to reinstate limitations similar to the Mexico City policy. When we can be sure that the funds are to be used for their intended purpose--that is, for family planning--I believe we will find a large consensus that will support the program. I, for one, will do so under those circumstances.

Mr. KYL. Thank you. 
Mr. President, after listening to the Chaplain's prayer this morning, I was reminded of the old saying, `Everybody wants to go to Heaven, but not everybody wants to do what is necessary to get there.' 
In his State of the Union Message, the President said he wanted to balance the budget by the year 2002, but he then went on to express opposition to the balanced budget amendment. Without the discipline of a constitutional balanced budget amendment, neither Congress nor the President will ever have the courage to pass one. 
The President has submitted a budget that is technically in balance by the year 2002. But let us look at it. If you check the fine print, you will find that 75 percent of the savings proposed by the President are postponed until the last 2 years of the 5-year plan, the years after President Clinton's term has ended. That is the problem. 
Just to cite the statistics, Mr. President, the budget deficit this year is about $107 billion. You would think if you are going to zero in the year 2002, and we are at $107 billion this year, we would reduce it a little each year until we got to zero. But actually the budget deficit goes up in fiscal year 1997, and the President's policies would boost it another $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1998 from where it would otherwise have been. In fact, in the last year--the year that we are supposed to be at zero--the savings required to achieve balance will be $117 billion. So the Congress will have to do more in savings in the very last year of this 5-year plan than we would have had to do to wipe out the deficit in its entirety this year. So $107 billion this year; we are going down to zero in the last year, and that last increment of savings is $117 billion. 
This is like the person who says, `I'm going to go on a diet. I've got to lose 30 pounds. And I'm going to give myself 6 months to do it. But I think I'll eat real high off the hog for the first 5 months and 2 weeks, maybe gain another 25 pounds or so, so that in the last 2 weeks I'll lose 55 pounds.' That is what the President's budget is suggesting. It is precisely why we need a constitutional amendment, to force the President and the Congress to make the tough choices to balance the budget; otherwise, it is the same old thing, just put it off until later. We all want to lose the weight, but we do not want to make the tough choices to lose it. 
Putting off tough choices for as long as possible is typical of just about every budget plan that we have had in the last several years, including the plan that Congress approved l 1/2 years ago. It is why the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law failed in the 1980's. 
After all the easy choices have been made in the first few years, progress toward a balanced budget stops dead in its tracks. No one wants to make the tough choices needed to achieve the larger savings scheduled down the road. So the deadline for the balance is always pushed off just a few more years. 
President Clinton's budget postpones most of the savings, as I said. 
Congress will no doubt come up with a budget that will do the same. That is what always happens. That is why the national debt continues to grow. 
Mr. President, 2 years ago when the balanced budget amendment lost by one vote, the national debt was approaching $4.9 trillion. Today, the debt is over $5.3 trillion--an increase of about $400 billion. That amounts to about $1,600--$1,600--for every man, woman and child in America. With that increase, each American's share of the national debt now totals about $20,000. That is about what the average Arizonan earns in a year. 
Two years ago opponents of the balanced budget amendment said a constitutional amendment is not necessary. All we need to do is muster the courage to do it ourselves. That is what our constituents sent us here to do, make these tough choices. But we do not make the tough choices. That is the way it always happens. 
We actually did pass a balanced budget in the Congress of the United States in 1995. In that year it was the President who vetoed the balanced budget. So, Mr. President, it demonstrates that it is both the Congress and the President. When we muster the courage, the President is the one who apparently lacks it. 
Since that time, 2 years ago, Congress has had to add tens of billions of dollars to the budget just to get the President to sign the funding bills into law and keep the Government operating. Just last September, Congress had to add $6.5 billion that it would not have otherwise spent. And that is on top of an increase of about $25 billion the Congress had already built into the year's spending legislation. 
Desire and good intentions are not enough to ensure that balance will ever be achieved. Unless we are bound by the Constitution, Members of Congress and the President will always find some reason to spend more or to put off for another year the savings that are needed. 
The former Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, the late Paul Tsongas, explained it this way in testimony before the Judiciary Committee 2 years ago: `There are a lot of votes in deficit spending. There are no votes in fiscal discipline. What you have here is a sad case of pursuit of self as opposed to pursuit of what is in the national interest.' 
Senator Tsongas went on to say this: `The fact that our generation could have conceived of having a consumptive lifestyle in leaving all that debt behind can only happen if we do not go home at night and look at our kids and grandkids and feel something.' 
Mr. President, it seems to me that our departed colleague really hit the nail on the head. The balanced budget amendment is about our children and our grandchildren and what kind of country we are going to leave them. 
For most of our Nation's history, each generation has worked hard and saved and invested so the next generation would be a little better off. Only in the last 40 years has that changed. Now Government cannot seem to live within its means no matter how much it collects in taxes. It has, quite literally, mortgaged the homes and businesses our children will not buy or build for decades to come. 
My second granddaughter was born just about a year ago and she already owes, as her share of the national debt, $20,000. In fact, she can expect to pay more than $187,000 in taxes during her lifetime just to pay the interest on the debt. What will be left from her income to care for her children? How will the Government care for the needy of tomorrow when almost every dollar in individual income tax revenue is devoted just to interest on the national debt? 
Mr. President, a balance budgeted offers hope. Yes, it will require the Congress to prioritize spending so the most important programs are not jeopardized, and wasteful programs will have to be eliminated. Some of the luxuries will have to be postponed. A balanced budget will require heavy lifting, but offers hope and opportunity to Americans today and our children tomorrow. 
The Congressional Budget Office predicts that a balanced budget would facilitate a reduction in long-term real interest rates of between 1 and 2 percent. That means that more Americans will have a chance to live the American dream--to own their own home. A 2-percent reduction on a typical 30-year mortgage of $80,000 would save homeowners $107 every month. That is $1,284 a year, or over $38,000 over the life of the mortgage. That is money in their pockets. A 2-percent reduction in interest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan would save buyers $676. The savings would accrue on student loans, and credit cards, and loans to businesses that want to expand or create new jobs. Reducing interest rates is probably one of the most important things that we can do to help people across this country. 
I know there are those who have doubts. Some will say that balancing the budget may make sense in good economic times, but it is too rigid and will prevent us from responding to economic emergencies or other hardship when that occurs. 
I think it is important first to point out that deficit spending is so ingrained in the Federal Government that we have been running deficits in good economic times as well as bad during the last 40 years. Deficits have not been run solely to rescue the economy from hardship. If they were, we would not be having this debate today. 
Second, it is important to remember that the balanced budget amendment could be waived in times of true emergency. To ensure such waivers were not invoked routinely or without good cause, three-fifths of the House and Senate would have to agree. That should not be difficult in the case of real emergency. 
For example, when Congress extended unemployment compensation in response to economic problems in 1975, 1980, 1982, and 1991, it usually did so by a three-fifths majority. So the amendment leaves enough flexibility to respond to real emergencies. 
Mr. President, there is now general consensus that balancing the budget is the right thing to do. The President says he is for it, and the Republican majority in Congress says it is for it. We may be able to reach an agreement with the President and pass a plan this year to balance the budget by the year 2002. But without a balanced budget amendment, Congress or the President will no doubt find some reason to backtrack from the plan, if not next year, then in the year 2000 or 2001, whenever the going gets tough. 
If we are serious about balancing the budget, we must support the balanced budget constitutional amendment. For our children's sake, we must do it now.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the next few months, millions of Americans will confront the annual task of filing their income-tax returns. What people would be startled to learn is that about 53 cents of every dollar of individual income tax they send in to the IRS this year will be required just to pay the interest on the national debt. 
That is 53 cents out of every dollar that will not be available to spend on health care for children, for education, for the environment, for aid to victims of domestic violence, for law enforcement, for national defense, or for any of the other important programs that serve the American people. It is 53 cents of every dollar just to pay interest on the bills that Congress and the President have racked up in years past. 
That 53 cents of every dollar does not even begin to pay down the national debt, which is increasing at a rate of $4,500 per second--a debt that threatens our children's very future. It now totals more than $5.3 trillion, or about $20,000 for every man, woman, and child in the country. 
Some people say that a balanced budget would mean drastic cuts in important programs. But it is really the deficit--the debt--that is savaging our ability to respond to the Nation's needs. How much more could we do for the American people if we did not have to set aside 53 cents of every income-tax dollar just to pay interest? How much more could people do for themselves if their tax bills were cut in half and they had that 53 cents to spend on their own needs? 
It is really a balanced budget--not more deficits--that offers the greatest protection for the important programs our Government provides. A balanced budget will ensure that we have the money, for example, to take care of our obligations to seniors and those in need, to make streets safe for law-abiding citizens, and to make our country secure. It is, after all, those programs--those programs that are priorities for the American people--that will be funded first under a balanced budget. 
Of course, setting priorities would be something new for the Federal Government. We are used to operating with a national checkbook that has had an unlimited balance. That has allowed Congress to spend as much as it wants for whatever it wants. And when you have an unlimited balance to draw from, every program is as important as the next. 
But as any family knows, when you have to live within your means, you cannot have everything. The basics come first. In the context of a balanced Federal budget, that means things like Social Security, Medicare, and national security move to the front of the line. 
That is what it means to prioritize. It is just plain common sense. 
Most economists predict that a balanced budget would facilitate a reduction in long-term interest rates of between one and two percent. That means that more Americans will have the chance to live the American dream--to own their own homes. A 2-percent reduction on a typical 30-year mortgage in Arizona would save homeowners over $220 a month. That is $2,655 a year. 
A 2-percent reduction in interest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan would save buyers $676. The savings would also accrue on student loans, and credit cards, and loans to businesses that want to expand and create new jobs. Reducing interest rates is probably one of the most important things we can do to help people across this country. It is money in the pocket of every American. 
Mr. President, we need to balance the budget. The American people want us to balance the budget. But the only way to ensure that we really get there is to pass the balanced budget amendment.

 Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on January 10, 1997, Albert Wohlstetter passed away. His death is a great loss--not only to his family and friends--but to our Nation, which has benefited over many decades from his intellectual brilliance, vision, and moral clarity. 
For more than 40 years, Albert Wohlstetter was involved in all aspects of U.S. national security policy. Presidents, from Truman to Bush, profited from his analysis of major defense and foreign policy issues. What students of strategic policy, what policymakers in the Pentagon have not read, `The Delicate Balance of Power'--and been awed by his penetrating insight? It speaks to his extraordinary, visionary intellect that he influenced so many from outside the beltway. Albert never joined any administration; he was never willing to take a position that may require compromise between truth and the demands of politics. 
As we approach the next century and the challenges it brings, we should keep in mind that Albert Wohlstetter was one of the staunchest champions of `peace through strength'--before the term became popular during the Reagan administration. Albert cautioned against the folly of seeking security in arms control agreements, and advocated placing our trust in America's military strength and technological ingenuity. 
As we look back on his article, `Spreading the Bomb Without Quite Breaking the Rules,' we can see so clearly that Albert was also ahead of his time--recognizing in the mid-1970's that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty's peaceful nuclear cooperation provisions would fuel the proliferation of nuclear technology. As a result, America, our friends and allies are faced today with a growing number of countries who possess or are on the way to possessing, nuclear weapons. 
Whether he was analyzing strategic issues or unveiling the hypocrisy of Western policies in Bosnia and Herzegovina, one could be sure of two things: Albert Wohlstetter was intellectually honest and thoroughly principled. For 4 long years, in countless articles, Albert reminded our leaders that with America's superpower status came not only vast military strength, but immense moral responsibility--and for those reasons, allowing a small nation in the center of Europe to become the victim of genocide was unconscionable.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last week, I introduced legislation to enhance the economic security of older Americans and small businesses around the country. The bill, known as the Family Heritage Preservation Act, would repeal the onerous Federal estate and gift tax, and the tax on generation-skipping transfers. Fifteen Senators have joined me as cosponsors of this very important initiative. 
Mr. President, most Americans know the importance of planning ahead for retirement. Sometimes that means buying a less expensive car, wearing clothes a little longer, or foregoing a vacation or two. But by doing with a little less during one's working years, people know they can enjoy a better and more secure life during retirement, and maybe even leave their children and grandchildren a little better off when they are gone. 
Savings not only create more personal security, they help create new opportunities for others, too. Savings are really investments that help others create new jobs in the community. They make our country more competitive. And ultimately they make a citizen's retirement more secure by providing a return on the money invested during his or her working years. 
So how does the Government reward all of this thrift and careful planning? It imposes a hefty tax on the end result of such activity--up to 55 percent of a person's estate. The respected liberal professor of law at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, observed that `polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes.' `The estate tax,' he went on to say, `is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings. There is no reason even a liberal populace need support it.' 
At one time, the estate tax was required of only the wealthiest Americans. Now inflation, a nice house, and a good insurance policy can push people of even modest means into its grip. The estate tax is applied to all of the assets owned by an individual at the time of death. The tax rate, which starts at 37 percent, can quickly rise to a whopping 55 percent--the highest estate tax rate in the world. 
As detrimental as the tax is for couples, it is even more harmful to small businesses, including those owned by women and minorities. The tax is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business' operations. It should come as no surprise then that a 1993 study by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, CT, research and consulting firm--found that 9 out of 10 family businesses that failed within 3 years of the principal owner's death attributed their companies' demise to trouble paying estate taxes; 6 out of 10 family owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation; 9 out of 10 never make it to the third generation. The estate tax is a major reason why. 
Think of what that means to women and minority-owned businesses. Instead of 
passing a hard-earned and successful business on to the next generation, many families have to sell the company in order to pay the estate tax. The upward mobility of such families is stopped in its tracks. The proponents of this tax always speak of the need to hinder `concentrations of wealth.' What the tax really hinders is new American success stories. 
With that in mind, the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the estate tax as one of small business's top concerns. Delegates to the conference voted overwhelmingly to endorse its repeal. 
Obviously, there is a great deal of peril to small businesses when they fail to plan ahead for estate taxes. So many small business owners try to find legal means of avoiding the tax or preparing for it, but that, too, comes at a significant cost. Some people simply slow the growth of their businesses to limit their estate tax burden. Of course, that means less investment in our communities and fewer jobs created. Others divert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires to insurance policies designed to cover estate tax costs. Still others spend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for estate tax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest in the company, start up new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better wages. 
The inefficiencies surrounding the tax can best be illustrated by the findings of a 1994 study published in the Seton Hall Law Review. That study found that compliance costs totaled a whopping $7.5 billion in 1992, a year when the estate tax raised only $11 billion. 
The estate tax raises only about 1 percent of the Federal Government's annual revenue, but it consumes 8 percent of each year's private savings. That is about $15 billion sidelined from the Nation's economy. Economists calculate that if the money paid in estate taxes since 1971 had been invested instead, total savings in 1991 would have been $399 billion higher, the economy would have been $46 billion larger, and we would have 262,000 more jobs. Obviously, the income and payroll taxes that would have been paid on these gains would have topped the amount collected by the Government in estate taxes. 
There have been nine attempts to reform the estate tax during the last 50 years. Few would contend that it has been made any fairer or more efficient. The only thing that has really changed is that lobbyists and estate planners have gotten a little wealthier. Probably the best thing we could do is repeal the estate tax altogether. That is what I am proposing in the Family Heritage Preservation Act. 
Mr. President, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which studied ways to make the Tax Code simpler, looked at the estate tax during the course of its deliberations just over a year ago. The Commission concluded that `it makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.' It went on to endorse repeal of the estate tax. 
I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the Family Heritage Preservation Act.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Voter Turnout Enhancement Study (VoTES) Commission Act, a bill designed to promote fiscal responsibility while helping to motivate more Americans to get to the polls on Election Day. 
Mr. President, there are far too many people who, for one reason or another, choose not to exercise their right to vote. Although the reasons for their non-participation are undoubtedly varied, I suspect that it comes down to a perception that the choices they will make on the ballot will not make enough of a difference. One person, explaining why she chose not to participate in last November's election, told the Tucson Citizen that `it doesn't make any difference in my life who's president.' This is a common enough sentiment that the election last fall posted one of the lowest voter turnout rates this century. 
The `Motor Voter' bill that President Clinton championed a few years ago as a way to get out the vote apparently had little effect, other than to impose additional costs and mandates on state and local governments and their taxpayers. Although the bill did help increase voter registration, it did little, if anything, to motivate people to get to the polls. Like the woman in Tucson, too many people did not believe they had enough of a stake in the outcome of the election to take the time to vote. 
Of course, people do have a stake in the outcome of every election. For one thing, the candidates chosen determine how much and for what purpose citizens are taxed. Most people I hear from say that is one area where the majority of those elected in the past failed to heed their concerns; they say their taxes are far too high. 
One survey, which was published in Reader's Digest last year, found that more than two-thirds of Americans felt their own taxes were `too high.' According to the poll, the maximum tax burden that Americans think a family of four should bear is 25 percent of its total income, even if the family's income is $200,000 per year. 
But the government takes far more than that. The average family--whose income is not $200,000, but something far less than that--now pays nearly 40 percent of its income in taxes. That is more than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. People around the country are reacting to that heavy burden. The new faces in the House and Senate in recent years have been those of people pledging to oppose tax increases and support tax cuts. President Clinton won reelection, promising to support tax cuts. In some cases, people around the country have also placed limits on how much their state governments can tax them. But advocates of tax cuts, and tax limits themselves, can only achieve their purpose if people are willing to go to the polls to support them. 
With that in mind, one way to demonstrate to people that their choices at the polls have a real effect on their lives would be to move the deadline for filing income tax returns to Election Day. That would give people a reason to vote by focusing their attention on the role of government--and how much it actually takes from them in taxes--on the day of the year that they have the greatest opportunity to influence change. Moving Tax Day to Election Day would probably result in more voter turnout and more change in Washington than anything else we could do. And of course, maximizing voter turnout is the best way to ensure that government officials heed the will of the people and make sound public policy. 
The bill I am introducing today would provide for a thoughtful and thorough analysis of a change in the tax-filing deadline from April to November, its potential effect on voter turnout, as well as any economic impact it might have. The bill explicitly requires that an independent commission conduct a cost-benefit analysis--a requirement that Congress would be wise to impose routinely on legislative initiatives to separate the good ideas from the bad, and save taxpayers a lot of money in the process. A number of other cost-limiting provisions have been included to protect taxpayers' interests. 
While just about every day of the year is celebrated by special interest groups around the country for the government largesse they receive, the taxpayers--the silent majority--have only one day of the year to focus on what that largesse means to them--how much it costs them--and that is Tax Day. I believe that it ought to coincide with Election Day.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Retirement Protection Act Amendments of 1997, a bill that will make a small but very important change in the pension-related provisions of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act. 
Mr. President, the 1994 trade act made some very significant changes in pension law, including a modification in the interest rate used to calculate lump-sum distributions from defined benefit pension plans. The act required such plans to use the interest rate on 30-year Treasury securities, a rate that is proving too volatile for many retirement plans, particularly small plans. 
Bruce Tempkin, an actuary and small business pension specialist at Louis Kravitz & Associates, described the effect of the change this way: `it is similar to taking out a variable-rate mortgage with no cap.' You could find yourself getting ready to retire and expecting a lump-sum distribution of a given amount, but being told that you will actually get a third less because the government just mandated an interest-rate change. That is not only unfair, it discourages people from participating in private pension plans at the very time we need to be encouraging more such planning. 
Recognizing the problem created by the 1994 law, legislators included language in the Small Business Job Protection Act last year to delay the effective date of the change for plans adopted and in effect before December 8, 1995. While I supported that delay, it is, at best, only a temporary solution. 
The bill I am introducing today proposes a permanent solution. It would give plans a one-time option to choose a fixed interest rate between five percent and eight percent instead of the floating 30-year Treasury rate. That will make it easier for employers to plan for the required contributions, and for employers and employees alike to understand what their lump-sum benefits will ultimately be. 
Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this initiative.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a series of bills aimed at improving our Nation's rate of economic growth, encouraging investment in small businesses, enhancing wages of American workers, and making our country more competitive in the global economy. The bills make up what I will call the Agenda for Economic Growth and Opportunity. 
Mr. President, it was just over 34 years ago that President John F. Kennedy made the following observation in his State of the Union message--an observation that someone could just as easily make about today's economy. He said, `America has enjoyed 22 months of uninterrupted economic recovery'. The current expansion, albeit one of the weakest this century, has gone on a little longer. `But', President Kennedy went on to say, `recovery is not enough. If we are to prevail in the long run, we must expand the long-run strength of our economy. We must move along the path to a higher rate of economic growth'. 
Economic growth. Tracking it is the domain of economists and statisticians, but what does it mean for the average American family, and why should policy-makers be so concerned about the slow rate of economic growth during the last 4 years? 
Slow growth means fewer job opportunities for young Americans just entering the work force and for those people seeking to free themselves from the welfare rolls. It means stagnant wages and salaries, and fewer opportunities for career advancement for those who do have jobs. It means less investment in new plant and equipment, and new technology--things needed to enhance workers' productivity and ensure that American businesses can remain competitive in the global marketplace. It means less revenue for the U.S. Treasury, compared to what we could collect with higher rates of economic growth, for the critical programs serving the American people. And it means that interest rates are higher than they need to be because national debt as a share of Gross Domestic Product is higher. As a result, we all pay more for such things as home mortgages, college loans, and car loans. 
For most of the 20th century, our Nation enjoyed very strong rates of economic growth and the dividends that came with it. The 1920s saw annual economic growth above 5 percent. In the 1950s, it was above 6 percent. Economic growth during the Kennedy and Johnson years averaged 4.8 percent annually. During the decade before President Clinton took office, the economy grew at an average rate of 3.2 percent a year, according to data supplied by the Joint Economic Committee. 
The Clinton years, by contrast, have seen the economy grow at an average rate of only about 2.3 percent. What that means is that, while we may not exactly be hurting as a Nation, we are not becoming much better off, either. And we are certainly not leaving much of a legacy for our children and grandchildren to meet the needs of tomorrow. 
So what do we do to enhance economic growth--to ensure that jobs are available for those who want them, that families can earn better wages, and that American business maintains a dominant role in the global economy? Those are, after all, the goals of the agenda I am laying out today--an agenda for economic growth and opportunity for all Americans, for those struggling to make ends meet today, and for our children when they enter the work force tomorrow. 
Let me answer then, beginning with another quotation from John Kennedy:  
`[I]t is increasingly clear--to those in Government, business, and labor who are responsible for our economy's success--that our obsolete tax system exerts too heavy a drag on private purchasing power, profits, and employment. Designed to check inflation in earlier years, it now checks growth instead. It discourages extra effort and risk. It distorts use of resources. It invites recurrent recessions, depresses our Federal revenues, and causes chronic budget deficits.' 
Mr. President, the agenda I am proposing attacks some of the most significant deficiencies in our Nation's Tax Code that are inhibiting savings and investment, and job creation--deficiencies that are preventing us from reaching our potential as a Nation. I do not make these proposals as a substitute for fundamental tax reform, which I believe is the ultimate solution to the problem. But fundamental tax reform is going to take some time to accomplish, maybe several years. What we need now are interim steps--things we can do quickly--to make sure our movement into the 21st century is based on the bedrock of a strong and growing economy. 
I believe these Tax Code changes will help strengthen the economy and, in turn, produce more revenue for the Federal Government to assist in deficit reduction. Still, I recognize that under existing budget rules which require static scoring of tax bills, there may be a need to find offsetting spending cuts. With that in mind, I am asking the Joint Committee on Taxation, as well as the respected Institute for Policy Innovation, to estimate the economic impact of these proposals, including the effect on federal revenues. Should the result of those analyses indicate that there will be some revenue loss--most likely because of rules requiring static scoring--my intention would be to propose some offsetting spending cuts. 
Mr. President, the cuts I would identify would come in so-called corporate welfare programs. In other words, in exchange for the targeted subsidies from corporate welfare programs, we would adopt broadly applicable tax incentives to support activities vetted by the free market. That is what free enterprise is all about.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first of the five tax-related bills I am introducing is based upon President John Kennedy's own growth package from three decades ago. Like the Kennedy plan, the legislation would reduce the percentage of long-term capital gains included in individual income subject to tax to 30 percent. It would reduce the alternative tax on the capital gains of corporations to 22 percent. 
I would note that Democratic President John Kennedy's plan called for a deeper capital gains tax cut than the Republican-controlled Congress proposed last year. 
There was a reason that John Kennedy called for a significant cut in the capital gains tax. `The present tax treatment of capital gains and losses is both inequitable and a barrier to economic growth', the President said. `The tax on capital gains directly affects investment decisions, the mobility and flow of risk capital from static to more dynamic situations, the ease or difficulty experienced by new ventures in obtaining capital, and thereby the strength and potential for growth of the economy.' 
So, if we are concerned whether new jobs are being created, whether new technology is developed, whether workers have the tools they need to do a better, more efficient job, we should support measures that reduce the cost of capital to facilitate the achievement of all these things. Remember, for every employee, there is an employer who took risks, made investments, and created jobs. But that employer needed capital to start. 
Also remember that the capital gains tax represents a second tax on amounts saved and invested. As a result, individuals and businesses that save and invest end up paying more taxes over time than if all income is consumed and no saving takes place at all. To make matters even worse, the tax is applied to gains due solely to inflation. 
Mr. President, it may come as a surprise to some people, but experience shows that lower capital gains tax rates have a positive effect on federal revenues. The most impressive evidence, as noted in a recent report by the American Council for Capital Formation, can be found in the period from 1978 to 1985. During those years, the top marginal federal tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost 45 percent--from 35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual capital gains tax receipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion annually. 
Research by experts at the prestigious National Bureau of Economic Research 
indicates that the maximizing capital gains tax rate--that is, the rate that would bring in the most Treasury revenue--is somewhere between nine and 21 percent. The bill I am introducing today would set an effective top rate on capital gains earned by individuals, by virtue of the 70 percent exclusion, at 11.88 percent. 
Mr. President, when capital gains tax rates are too high, people need only hold onto their assets to avoid the tax indefinitely. No sale, no tax. But that means less investment, fewer new businesses and new jobs, and--as historical records show--far less revenue to the Treasury than if capital gains taxes were set at a lower level. Just as the Target store down the street does not lose money on weekend sales--because volume more than makes up for lower prices--lower capital gains tax rates can encourage more economic activity and, in turn, produce more revenue for the government. 
Capital gains reform will help the Treasury. A capital gains tax reduction would help unlock a sizable share of the estimated $7 trillion of capital that is left virtually unused because of high tax rates. More importantly, it will help the family that has a small plot of land it would like to sell, and the business that could expand, buy new equipment and create new jobs. 
And evidence shows that most of the benefits will go to Americans of modest means. A special U.S. Treasury study covering 1985 showed that nearly half of all capital gains that year were realized by taxpayers with wage and salary income of less than $50,000 a year. An update of the Treasury study by the Barents Group, a subsidiary of the public accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick, estimates that for 1995, middle-income wage and salary earners making $50,000 or less in inflation-adjusted dollars will continue to receive almost half of all capital gains. 
President Clinton recognized the importance of lessening the capital gains tax burden by proposing to eliminate the tax on most gains earned on the sale of a home. I would support the President's proposal, but I would also ask, if a capital gains tax cut is good for homeowners, is it not also good policy to apply a tax cut to other kinds of gains that help create new businesses and new jobs? 
I believe John Kennedy's plan was far superior--far more beneficial for the Nation's economy--than the very limited one Bill Clinton has proposed. That is why I encourage the Senate to take up the Capital Gains Reform Act, which is based on the Kennedy plan, and which I am introducing today.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the second in this series of bills is the Corporate Tax Equity Act, a bill designed to help U.S. businesses make larger capital expenditures and thereby enhance productivity growth and job creation by repealing the corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). 
Mr. President, the original intent of the AMT was to make it harder for large, profitable corporations to avoid paying any federal income tax. But the way to have accomplished that objective was not, in my view, to impose an AMT, but to identify and correct the provisions of law that allowed large companies to inappropriately lower their federal tax liabilities to begin with. Ironically, the primary shelters corporations were using to minimize their tax liability--that is, the accelerated depreciation and safe harbor leasing of the old Tax Code--were being corrected at the time the AMT was enacted. 
I would point out that the AMT is not a tax, per se. As indicated in an April 3, 1996 report by the Congressional Research Service, the AMT is merely intended to serve as a prepayment of the regular corporate income tax, not a permanent increase in overall corporate tax liability. What that means in practical terms is that businesses are forced to make interest-free loans to the federal government under the guise of the AMT. Corporations pay a tax for which they are not liable, but which they are able to apply toward their future regular tax liability. 
I would also point out that most of the corporations paying the AMT are relatively small. The General Accounting Office, in a 1995 report on the issue, found that, in most years between 1987 and 1992, more than 70 percent of corporations paying the AMT had less than $10 million in assets. 
The AMT's effect on the economy, moreover, is disproportionate to the small amount of revenue raised, due in large part to its requirement that corporations calculate their tax liability under two separate but parallel income tax systems. Firms must calculate their AMT liability even if they end up paying the regular tax. At a minimum, that means that firms must maintain two sets of records for tax purposes. 
The compliance costs are substantial. In 1992, for example, while only about 28,000 corporations paid the AMT, more than 400,000 corporations filed the AMT form, and an even greater--but unknown--number of firms performed the calculations needed to determine their AMT liability. A 1993 analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation found that the AMT added 16.9 percent to a corporation's total cost of complying with federal income tax laws. 
Mr. President, repealing the corporate AMT would help free up badly needed capital to assist in business expansion and job creation. According to a study by DRI/McGraw-Hill, repeal of the AMT would, over the 1996-2005 time period, increase fixed investment by a total of 7.9 percent, raise Gross Domestic Product by 1.6 percent, and increase labor productivity by 1.6 percent. The study also projected repeal would produce an additional 100,000 jobs a year during the years 1998 to 2002.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the third bill in this package is the Small Business Investment and Growth Act, which would ensure that small businesses do not pay a higher income tax rate than large corporations. Congressman Phil Crane of Illinois has promoted similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, the 1990 and 1993 increases in the marginal income tax rates applicable to individuals put a tremendous strain on small businesses organized as S corporations, because they pay taxes at the individual rate. S corporations, facing 36 percent and 39.6 percent tax rates at the highest levels, are forced to compete against larger corporations, which pay a top rate of 34 percent. 
The bill I am introducing would establish 34 percent as the top rate that small businesses must pay. Taxable small business income would be limited to income from the trade or business of certain eligible small businesses, specifically excluding passive income. To benefit from the maximum 34 percent rate, businesses must reinvest their after-tax income into the business. 
The intent is to provide relief for those small businesses that invest income into their business operations, thereby creating new jobs. In fact, successful small manufacturers have been able to create three to four new jobs for every additional $100,000 they retain in the business.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the fourth in the series of economic growth incentives is a bill to enhance the economic security of older Americans and small businesses around the country, a bill known as the Family Heritage Preservation Act. It would repeal the onerous Federal estate and gift tax, and the tax on generation-skipping transfers. A companion bill will be introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chris Cox of California. 
Mr. President, most Americans know the importance of planning ahead for retirement. Sometimes that means buying a less expensive car, wearing clothes a little longer, or foregoing a vacation or two. But by doing with a little less during one's working years, people know they can enjoy a better and more secure life during retirement, and maybe even leave their children and grandchildren a little better off when they are gone. 
Savings not only create more personal security, they help create new opportunities for others, too. Savings are really investments that help others create new jobs in the community. They make our country more competitive. And ultimately they make a citizen's retirement more secure by providing a return on the money invested during his or her working years. 
So how does the government reward all of this thrift and careful planning? It imposes a hefty tax on the end result of such activity--up to 55 percent of a person's estate. The respected liberal Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, observed that `polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and cigarettes.' `The estate tax,' he went on to say, `is an anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on thrift, on long term savings. There is no reason even a liberal populace need support it.' 
At one time, the estate tax was required of only the wealthiest Americans. Now inflation, a nice house, and a good insurance policy can push people of even modest means into its grip. The estate tax is applied to all of the assets owned by an individual at the time of death. The tax rate, which starts at 37 percent, can quickly rise to a whopping 55 percent--the highest estate tax rate in the world. 
It is true that each person has a $600,000 exemption, but that does not provide as much relief as one might expect. Unless a couple goes through expensive estate planning so that trusts are written into their wills and at least $600,000 of the assets are owned by each spouse--that is, not held jointly--the couple will end up with only one $600,000 exemption. Many people do not realize that literally every asset they own, including the face value of life insurance policies, all retirement plan assets, including Individual Retirement Accounts, is counted toward the $600,000 limit. 
As detrimental as the tax is for couples, it is even more harmful to small businesses, including those owned by women and minorities. The tax is imposed on a family business when it is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that business's operations. It should come as no surprise then that a 1993 study by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, Connecticut research and consulting firm--found that nine out of 10 family businesses that failed within three years of the principal owner's death attributed their companies' demise to trouble paying estate taxes. Six out of 10 family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation. Nine out of 10 never make it to the third generation. The estate tax is a major reason why. 
Think of what that means to women and minority-owned businesses. Instead of passing a hard-earned and successful business on to the next generation, many families have to sell the company in order to pay the estate tax. The upward mobility of such families is stopped in its tracks. The proponents of this tax say they want to hinder `concentrations of wealth.' What the tax really hinders is new American success stories. 
With that in mind, the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the estate tax as one of small business's top concerns. Delegates to the conference voted overwhelming to endorse its repeal. 
Obviously, there is a great deal of peril to small businesses when they fail to plan ahead for estate taxes. So many small business owners try to find legal means of avoiding the tax or preparing for it, but that, too, comes at a significant cost. Some people simply slow the growth of their businesses to limit their estate tax burden. Of course, that means less investment in our communities and fewer jobs created. Others divert money they would have spent on new equipment or new hires to insurance policies designed to cover estate tax costs. Still others spend millions on lawyers, accountants, and other advisors for estate tax planning purposes. But that leaves fewer resources to invest in the company, start up new businesses, hire additional people, or pay better wages. 
The inefficiencies surrounding the tax can best be illustrated by the findings of a 1994 study published in the Seton Hall Law Review. That study found that compliance costs totalled a whopping $7.5 billion in 1992, a year when the estate tax raised only $11 billion. 
The estate tax raises only about one percent of the federal government's annual revenue, but it consumes eight percent of each year's private savings. That is about $15 billion sidelined from the Nation's economy. Economists calculate that if the money paid in estate taxes since 1971 had been invested instead, total savings in 1991 would have been $399 billion higher, the economy would have been $46 billion larger, and we would have 262,000 more jobs. Obviously, the income and payroll taxes that would have been paid on these gains would have topped the amount collected by the government in estate taxes. 
There have been nine attempts to reform the estate tax during the last 50 years. Few would contend that it has been made any fairer or more efficient. The only thing that has really changed is that lobbyists and estate planners have gotten a little wealthier. Probably the best thing we could do is repeal the estate tax altogether. That is what I am proposing in the Family Heritage Preservation Act. 
Mr. President, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, which studied ways to make the tax code simpler, looked at the estate tax during the course of its deliberations just over a year ago. The Commission concluded that `[i]t makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose extra taxes on people who choose to pass their assets on to their children and grandchildren instead of spending them lavishly on themselves.' It went on to endorse repeal of the estate tax.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the last in the series of bills that make up what I call the Agenda for Economic Growth and Opportunity is the Invest More in America Act, a bill that would allow small businesses to fully deduct the first $250,000 they invest in equipment in the year it is purchased. The bill is based on another recommendation made by the White House Conference on Small Business in 1995. 
Mr. President, Congress last year approved legislation to phase in an increase in the expensing limit to $25,000 by the year 2003. That is a step in the right direction, but it is not nearly enough. 
Businesses investing more than the annual expensing allowance must recover the cost of their investments over several years using the current depreciation system. Inflation, however, erodes the present value of their depreciation deductions taken in future years. Moreover, many businesses are required to make significant capital investments to comply with various government regulations, including environmental regulations, yet in many cases are unable to immediately expense such costs. 
The increased expensing allowance provided by the Invest More in America Act would spur additional investment in business assets and lead to increased productivity and more jobs.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am asking the Joint Tax Committee and the Institute for Policy Innovation to analyze the economic and revenue effects of this economic growth package. It is my intention that, if there is a revenue loss to the Treasury associated with it, the loss could at least partially be offset by reductions in corporate welfare spending. 
Mr. President, the Agenda for Economic Growth and Opportunity will help improve the standard of living for all Americans. It will help eliminate from the federal budget much of the largesse the government showers on a select group of business enterprises through corporate welfare. 
I invite my colleagues' support for this very important initiative.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to ensure that crime victims are treated with fairness, dignity, and respect, I rise to introduce, along with Senator Feinstein, a resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to establish and protect the rights of crime victims. 
This resolution is the product of extended discussions with Chairman Henry Hyde, Senators Hatch and Biden, the Department of Justice, the White House, law enforcement officials, major victims' rights groups, and such diverse scholars as Professors Larry Tribe and Paul Cassell. As a result of these discussions, the core values in the original amendment remain unchanged, but the language has been refined to better protect the interest of all parties. 
Each year, about 40 million Americans are victimized, first by criminals and a second time by a government that affords them no constitutional rights. The Victims' Rights Amendment is a constitutional amendment that will bring balance to the system by giving crime victims the rights to be informed, present, and heard at critical stages throughout their ordeal--the least the system owes to those it failed to protect.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment, a resolution to amend the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced federal budget and to limit spending to 19 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
Mr. President, few people realize it, but for the last 40 years, revenues to the U.S. Treasury have remained relatively steady as a share of national income. No matter whether economic times were good or bad, whether the nation was at peace or engaged in military conflict, or whether income tax rates were as high as 90 percent or as low as 28 percent, the total amount of revenue flowing to the U.S. Treasury has always amounted to about 19 percent of the nation's income. 
That is really quite remarkable. With history as a guide, it means that higher tax rates will not produce more revenue for the government proportionate to the size of the economy. Such rate increases merely slow down the rate of economic growth, and that is why tax increases never produce as much revenue as anticipated. 
At the family level, it means some people will work fewer hours to avoid being pushed into a higher tax bracket. Others will invest less, or invest in less productive ventures, in order to minimize their tax burdens. Still others, when hit by higher taxes, cut back on the goods or services they buy, and that means less work--and less taxable income--for someone else. 
In other words, changes in the tax code affect people's behavior. Lower tax rates stimulate the economy, resulting in more taxable income and transactions, and, in turn, more revenue to the Treasury. Higher taxes discourage work, production, savings, and investment, so revenues are always less than initially projected. Although tax cuts and tax rate increases may create temporary declines and surges in revenue, history proves that revenues always adjust at roughly the same percentage of GDP as people adjust their behavior to the new tax code. 
It is important for us to understand this phenomenon because it means that Congress cannot balance the federal budget by raising tax rates. If the goal is to balance the budget--and that is what a balanced budget amendment will require--the only way to succeed is to limit federal spending to the level of revenue that the economy is willing to bear. That happens to be 19 percent of GDP. That is what the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Act seeks to do in a very explicit way. 
Other versions of the balanced budget amendment would achieve the same objective, including the version of the amendment that is most likely to pass in the next few weeks. The problem is, without explicitly limiting spending and precluding tax rate increases, Congress might try to balance the budget by raising taxes. And as I have illustrated in prior remarks, that would not only be ineffective, it would be harmful to the economy. 
Higher taxes would mean that fewer jobs would be created; some people would lose their jobs. Wages would not grow as fast. Output would fall, or would grow only slowly. And in the end, spending would probably still outpace revenue, requiring another round of deficit reduction to meet the requirements of the balanced budget amendment. If balance were actually achieved, it could probably not be sustained for very long because high tax rates would slow the economy, resulting in lower revenues in future years. 
The advantage of the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment is that it keeps our eye on the ball. It tells Congress to limit spending. And by linking spending to economic growth, it gives Congress a positive incentive to enact pro-growth economic policies. Only a healthy and growing economy--measured by GDP--would increase the dollar amount that Congress is allowed to spend, although always proportionate to the size of the economy. 
In other words, 19 percent of a larger GDP represents more revenue to the Treasury than 19 percent of a smaller GDP. 
I urge my colleagues to consider the advantages of the Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment and to join me as cosponsors of the initiative. In the event that a different version of the balanced budget amendment passes, I suggest we will have to consider a free-standing spending limitation amendment in the future if we are interested in promoting both fiscal responsibility and economic growth and opportunity for all Americans.

Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and 17 of my Senate colleagues to introduce the Tax Limitation Amendment, a proposed amendment to the Constitution to require a two-thirds vote of the House and Senate to increase taxes. 
Mr. President, on Election Day last year, by overwhelming majorities, voters from Florida to California approved initiatives aimed at limiting government's ability to raise taxes. Florida's Question One, which would require a two-thirds vote of the people to enact or raise any state taxes or fees, passed with 69.2 percent of the vote. 
Seventy percent of Nevada voters approved the Gibbons amendment, requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the state legislature to pass new taxes or tax hikes. South Dakotans easily approved an amendment requiring either a vote of the people or a two-thirds vote of the legislature for any state tax increase. 
And California voters tightened the restrictions in the most famous tax limitation of all, Proposition 13, so that now all taxes at the local level must be approved by a vote of the people. Of course, voters in my home state of Arizona overwhelmingly approved a state tax limit of their own in 1992. 
The Tax Limitation Amendment I am introducing would impose similar constraints on federal tax-raising authority. It would require a two-thirds majority vote of each house of Congress to pass any bill levying a new tax or increasing the rate or base of any existing tax. In short, any measure taking more out of the taxpayers' pockets would require a supermajority vote to pass. 
Congress could vote to waive the requirement in times of war, or when the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious threat to national security. But any new taxes imposed under such a waiver could only remain in effect for a maximum of two years. 
Most Americans believe the federal government is already taxing them far too much. In 1950, the average family paid one dollar in taxes to the federal government out of every 50 dollars earned. Today, it pays almost one dollar out of every three dollars earned. Add state and local taxes to the mix, and the tax bite is closer to one out of every two-and-a-half dollars earned. 
I would note that the Tax Limitation Amendment would not affect Congress' ability to cut taxes. That could still be achieved by simple majority vote. It would, however, make it much harder to raise taxes, particularly if there is no broad-based, bipartisan support for the proposition in Congress or around the country. It would, for example, have prevented enactment of the tax hike of 1993, one of the largest in history, and one which even a majority of Senators did not support. Vice President Gore broke a 50 to 50 vote tie to secure its passage. The TLA would have prevented enactment of the Bush tax increase of 1990. 
Raising sufficient revenue to pay for government's essential operations is obviously a necessary part of governing, but raising tax rates is not necessarily the best way to raise revenue. And in any event, voters around the country seem to believe that raising taxes should only be done when there is broad support for the proposition. The TLA will ensure that no tax can be raised in the future without such consensus.
