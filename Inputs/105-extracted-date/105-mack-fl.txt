 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to remedy a problem in the way the U.S. taxes the foreign operations of U.S. electric and gas utilities. With the 1992 passage of the National Energy Policy Act, Congress gave a green light to U.S. utilities wishing to do business abroad, lifting a long-standing prohibition. U.S. utilities were allowed to compete for the foreign business opportunities created by the privatization of national utilities and the need for the construction of facilities to meet increased energy demands abroad. 
Since 1992, U.S. utility companies have made significant investments in utility operations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Eastern Europe, the Far East and South America. These investments in foreign utilities have created domestic jobs in the fields of design, architecture, engineering, construction, and heavy equipment manufacturing. They also allow U.S. utilities an opportunity to diversify and grow. 
Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Code penalizes these investments by subjecting them to double-taxation. U.S. companies with foreign operations receive tax credits for a portion of the taxes they pay to foreign countries, to reduce the double-taxation that would otherwise result from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. The size of these foreign tax credits are affected by a number of factors, as U.S. tax laws recalculate the amount of foreign income that is recognized for tax credit purposes. 
Section 864 of the tax code allocates deductible interest expenses between the U.S. and foreign operations based on the relative book values of assets located in the U.S. and abroad. By ignoring business realities and the peculiar circumstances of U.S. utilities, this allocation rule overtaxes them. Because U.S. utilities were until recently prevented from operating abroad, their foreign plants and equipment have been recently-acquired and consequently have not been much depreciated, in contrast to their domestic assets which are in most cases fully-depreciated. Thus a disproportionate amount of interest expenses are allocated to foreign income, reducing the foreign income base that is recognized for U.S. tax purposes thus the size of the corresponding foreign tax credits. 
As the allocation rules increase the double-taxation of foreign income by reducing foreign tax credits, they also increase domestic taxation by shifting interest deductions from U.S. to foreign operations. The unfairness of this misallocation is magnified by the fact that interest expenses are usually associated with domestically-regulated debt, which is tied to domestic production and is not as fungible as the tax code assumes. 
The result of this economically-irrational taxation scheme is a very high effective tax rate on certain foreign investment and a loss of U.S. foreign tax credits. Rather than face this double-tax penalty, some U.S. utilities have actually chosen not to invest overseas and others have pulled back from their initial investments. 
One solution to this problem is found in the legislation that I am introducing today. This remedy is to exempt from the interest allocation rules of Section 864 the debt associated with a U.S. utility's furnishing and sale of electricity or natural gas in the United States. This proposed rule is similar to the rule governing `non-recourse' debt, which is not subjected to foreign allocation. In both cases, lenders look to specific cash flows for repayment and specific assets as collateral. These loans are thus distinguishable from the typical risks of general credit lending transactions. 
The specific cash flow aspect of non-recourse financing is a critical element of the non-recourse debt exception, and logic requires that the same tax treatment should be given to analogous utility debt. Thus, my bill would exempt from allocation to foreign source income the interest on debt incurred in the trade or business of furnishing or selling electricity or natural gas in the United States. The current situation is a very real problem that must be remedied, and I urge my colleagues to support the solution I am proposing.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last year in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax policy of the Clinton administration concerning business meal deductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the percentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 percent down to 50 percent. The administration marketed this as an attack on the `three martini lunch,' but the tax increase was in fact a big blow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose jobs require them to be stranded far from home. 
Workers who are covered by federal `hours of service' regulations--long-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance bus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no choice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a necessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton administration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. For the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, this tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot of money to these hard-working taxpayers. 
Congress addressed this inequity last year, passing a provision that would gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent for these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today I am introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent deduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the federal `hours of service' regulations.

 Ms. MACK. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Credit for Early Action Act, I rise to congratulate Senator Chafee on its introduction, as well as the other original cosponsor, Senator Lieberman, and to make several points about the bill. 
The purpose of the act is simple. It is to encourage and reward voluntary actions which businesses may take to reduce emissions of `greenhouse gases' such as carbon dioxide. It would not require actions, but it would provide encouragement in the form of credit, credit that could be used by companies to manage future regulatory requirements, or in a market-based approach, traded or sold to other companies as they worked to meet their own obligations. 
Given the uncertainty that surrounds the discussion of greenhouse gases and global warming, I can understand why some may question the need for such a bill. As one who is not convinced that we understand this issue well enough, I can understand that question. In fact, it is precisely because of the uncertainty that I think such a bill makes sense. 
Of course there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding such possible results, and frankly, as I said, I am not convinced that we know enough yet. The complexities and uncertainties associated with trying to understand the vast interactions of our climate, our atmosphere and our human impact on both, are enormous. And the consequences of actions targeted at changing our patterns of energy use can be dramatic. 
But uncertainty cuts two ways, and the possibility always exists that some of these projections about impacts could be more right than wrong. Perhaps then it makes sense to provide some appropriate encouragement, so that those who want to invest in improved efficiency, those who want to find ways to make cars and factories and power production cleaner, those companies can receive some encouragement, not based on government fiat or handout, but based on getting credit for their own initiative and actions. The environmental result will likely be some lessening of the potential problems associated with possible global warming, and that just makes sense. 
There is, of course, another uncertainty that gives me pause as well, and that serves as another strong reason for my interest in this bill. It is clear to me today that there is no desire on the part of this Congress to legislate requirements on carbon dioxide or any of the other `greenhouse gases.' I think that is the correct position. 
But we cannot know today what some future Congress, perhaps a decade away, might decide to do. Perhaps the science will become more compelling. Perhaps the majority will shift back to a more regulatory minded party. Perhaps a future Senate will decide to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. Perhaps a future administration and a future majority will combine to put a regulatory structure in place that will require substantial reductions of these gases. And while we may oppose such action today, we cannot know the outcome of this future debate. 
Given this regulatory uncertainty, I think a compelling argument can be made to provide protection for companies today, so that they are protected against the possibility of future requirements. What this bill will do is just that. By allowing companies to earn credit for actions that they take over the next few years, the bill will make sure that if a regulator comes to see them in the future, they can say, `I already did my part.' Companies can make decisions based on their own best interest, they can work to improve efficiency and reduce waste. And if this bill becomes law, they can get credit for those actions against any future regulatory controls on greenhouse gases. That seems like a good idea to me. 
In closing Mr. President, I again want to congratulate Senator Chafee, along with our other original co-sponsor Senator Lieberman, for this thoughtful, balanced approach to the uncertainty presented by the climate change issue. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I want to urge my colleagues to take a good look at this approach so that we can begin to move forward in earnest in the next Congress.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Water Resources Development Act of 1998 (WRDA 98). WRDA 98 recognizes the importance of Florida's natural resources--through the authorization of projects and studies related to the Everglades, flood control, shore protection and water supply. 
The investment Congress has made in the Everglades is significant. The authorization of the extension of the Everglades' Critical Restoration Projects is important because there are many stakeholders involved. The Senate, through WRDA 98, sends a clear message that this investment is important. 
WRDA 98 recognizes the leadership Florida provides in the development of water resources by authorizing Aquifer Storage & Recovery projects in South Florida, as well as a deep water storage project in the Caloosahatchee River basin. These projects provide the important and necessary next steps to continue the progress made in the restoration of the Everglades. 
Finally, a critical Alternative Water Source provision provides the necessary framework for developing a sustainable water supply as Florida continues to experience unprecedented growth. In total, WRDA 98 provides for the authorization of 23 projects in Florida to meet important shore protection, flood control and water supply needs in the State. 
The amendment (No. 3803) was agreed to.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, to clarify various provisions in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 and discuss the understandings reached among conferees regarding these provisions. 
Section 508 requires a disregard of earned income under some circumstances, including persons who obtain employment after one year of unemployment. The rules defining `unemployment' for this purpose should provide sufficient flexibility so that a family member who may have a brief, temporary period of employment during the preceding year would not be ineligible for the disregard. At the same time, the rules must not encourage households to change their employment patterns to take advantage of the disregard. 
Section 519 provides guidance for a new Operating Fund formula, including that agencies will `benefit' from increases in rental income due to increases in earned income by families in occupancy. The extent of this benefit will be determined in the negotiated rulemaking on the Operating Fund formula. More generally, the Operating Fund formula should not be skewed against or discourage mixing of incomes in public housing that is consistent with the bill's objectives. With respect to the Capital Fund formula, the possibility of having an incentive to encourage agencies to leverage other resources, including through mixed-finance transactions, should be considered during the negotiated rulemaking process. 
Section 520 amends the current definition of total development costs, but retains the current law directive in section 6(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act that these guidelines are to allow publicly bid construction of good and sound quality. In the past, HUD has not interpreted this reference in a way that allows for sufficiently durable construction, of a nature that will reduce maintenance and repair costs and will assure that public housing meets reasonable community standards. The Department should interpret this section as requiring the use of indices such as the R.S. Means cost index for construction of `average' quality and the Marshal & Swift cost index for construction of `good' quality. 
Where a family is relocated due to demolition or disposition, voluntary conversion of a development to tenant-based assistance or homeownership (sections 531, 533 and 536), the family must be offered comparable housing that is located in an area that is generally not less desirable than the location of the displaced resident's housing. For purposes of this provision, the phrase `location of the displaced resident's housing' may be construed to mean the public housing development from which the family was vacated, rather than a larger geographic area. 
Where a family is relocated due to demolition or disposition, voluntary or required conversion of 
public housing to tenant-based assistance or a homeownership program (sections 531, 533, 536 and 537), relocation may be to another public housing unit of the agency at a rental rate that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the unit from which the family is vacated. However, this requirement does not mean that the rental rate always must be exactly the same. Specifically, if the agency has exercised its discretionary authority in the initial unit to charge less than thirty percent of adjusted income and that authority would be inapplicable to or inappropriate for the new unit, the comparable rent could be a rent that would apply if this discretionary authority had not been exercised (i.e., up to thirty percent of adjusted income). 
With respect to public housing demolition (section 531), the conference report does not include a provision from the Senate bill that would deem applications approved if HUD did not respond within 60 days. However, HUD is urged to continue processing applications responsibly and expeditiously. In the same section, references to demolition or disposition of a `project' may be applied to portions of projects where only portions are undergoing demolition or disposition. 
In the provisions for voluntary or required conversion of public housing to vouchers (sections 533 and 537), residents of affected developments are to be provided notification that they can remain in their dwelling unit and use tenant-based assistance if the affected development or portion is to be used as housing. In many such instances, the development may be undergoing rehabilitation, reconfiguration or demolition and new construction. If so, the resident would be entitled to stay in the same development and use tenant-based assistance, but not necessarily the same dwelling unit. 
The bill provides for the possibility of transfer of housing from an agency to an eligible management entity due to the mismanagement of the agency (section 534). Such mismanagement may relate to a single housing development, rather than more widespread mismanagement. 
With respect to the definition of `mixed-finance projects' in section 539, the requirement that a project is financially assisted by private resources means that the private resources must be greater than a de minimis amount. In addition, in the same section, new Section 35(h) of the 1937 Act applies only to a mixed-finance project that has a `significant number' of units other than public housing units. Therefore, this section would not apply to a mixed-finance project which had only a de minimis number of units other than public housing units. 
It is intended that wherever appropriate in programs authorized throughout the bill, reasonable accommodation be made for persons with disabilities. This would apply, for example, in homeownership programs authorized by section 536. With respect to the setting of voucher payment standards authorized by section 545, agencies are urged to make payment standard adjustments to facilitate reasonable availability of suitable and accessible units and assure full participation of persons with disabilities. Subject to the availability of funds, HUD also should allow administrative fee adjustments to cover any necessary additional expenses for serving persons with disabilities fully, such as additional counseling expenses. 
The provision allowing HUD to phase in the new Section 8 law, section 559, provides HUD the flexibility to apply current law to assistance obligated before October 1, 1999. This language is intended to be construed so that HUD may continue for as long as necessary to apply current law to families now assisted by Section 8, to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator D'Amato's comments are absolutely accurate. Section 556 of the Act was added in response to a vociferous outcry among housing authorities and low-income advocates who feared that HUD's administrative actions during Fiscal Year 1998 could have inadvertently led to a decline in housing assistance under the Section 8 program. The renewal terms included in the Act are intended to avoid such a result and will ensure that full funding for the program is maintained. I appreciate the Chairman's work to ensure that this provision will not have adverse budgetary implications.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I welcome the comments of my friend, Senator D'Amato. Indeed, the amendments to the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 which we have included in the Act represent a significant improvement in the program. The amendments will provide renewable grants for agencies that meet performance standards established by HUD. In addition, housing authorities with urgent or serious crime needs are protected and will be assured an equitable amount of funding. 
Mr. President, the intent of these provisions is to provide more certain funding for agencies with clear needs for funds and to assure that both current funding recipients and other agencies with urgent or serious crime problems are appropriately assisted by the program. The provisions will also reduce the administrative costs of the current application process which entails a substantial paperwork burden for agencies and HUD. Under the terms of the amendments, HUD can establish a fixed funding mechanism in which the relative needs of housing authorities are addressed with a greater amount of certainty.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this conference report. I want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bond, and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski for bringing to the floor a well-balanced bill. 
I am extremely pleased that this bill contains a comprehensive reform of the nation's system of public and assisted housing. We began this process of reforming public housing more than three years ago. Negotiating this legislation was a long, difficult and sometimes painful process. But the end result is a carefully crafted, bipartisan compromise that reflects input from the Senate, the House, and the administration. I believe it is a good bill. I appreciate the indulgence of Chairman Bond in permitting the authorizing committee to utilize the appropriations process as the vehicle to enact these important reforms, and I appreciate his long-standing support of public housing reform. In the end, it was the willingness of the Appropriations Committee to increase the level of incremental section 8 assistance that removed the last hurdle to this agreement. 
I want to express special thanks to Senator Paul Sarbanes for his critical role in the development of this legislation and in the recent negotiations. I am convinced that this agreement would not have been possible without the leadership and support of the Senator from Maryland, and I can't thank him enough. I also want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, for his steady support and guidance over the past 3 years, and also the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, Senator Kerry, who has made major contributions to this legislation. This has truly been a bipartisan effort throughout. 
There are so many people that have played a role in this. Obviously, the Secretary of HUD, Secretary Cuomo, and I spent many hours and many, many phone calls trying to work through this and working also with Congressman Lazio, who made a special effort to try to find a way to bring this to a conclusion, and also the work of Congressman Lewis, the chairman of the subcommittee on the House side. So, again, this has truly been a bipartisan effort. I thank all of those who were involved. 
Since my appointment to the Banking Committee almost 10 years ago, I have visited public housing developments throughout Florida and in cities like Detroit, Chicago, and Jersey City. I have seen public housing that is well run and I have seen public housing that concentrates the very poorest of the poor in developments that are havens for crime and drug abuse and islands of welfare dependency. 
On a personal note, I want to say to my colleagues that while I have been working on this specific legislation now for 4 years, I have been involved in public housing issues now for 10 years, since I have been on the Banking Committee. There are two particular thoughts that come to my mind, two visits that I made. 
I spoke with individuals that lived in public housing, and that significantly affected me. I am pleased to say it has had a major role in this legislation that we developed. One person was an individual from Liberty City in Miami, who, frankly, grew up in public housing in Liberty City and saw how public housing has changed since the late 1930s. She--and I have used this term --`screamed' at me as she was explaining to me the problems she was dealing with and how she used to have a decent place to live and how it had been destroyed over the years. Her message was heard. 
I also think of a little 4, 5, or 6-year-old boy in Melbourne, FL. When we walked out of an apartment that was totally destroyed, as we walked down between these three-story buildings and saw the boarding up of windows and doors hanging by their hinges, this little fellow was walking down between the buildings. I thought to myself, what kind of future can this little fellow possibly dream of if the only environment in which he was going to live was the public housing like we saw. I wanted to share that with my colleagues. 
The time is long overdue for us to eliminate the disincentives to work and economic self-sufficiency that trap people in poverty, and to ease the complex, top-down bureaucratic rules and regulations that aggravate the problems and prevent housing authorities from operating effectively and efficiently. It is time to begin the process of deconcentrating the poor, create mixed-income communities with role models and establish a foundation for building communities of hope instead of despair. 
Let me make clear that this is only the beginning. The effect of these reforms won't be felt overnight. We are creating a framework for meaningful and beneficial change in our public and assisted housing system. But our ultimate success will depend on the ongoing cooperation and commitment of Congress, HUD, housing authorities, residents, and local communities. 
The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve the nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program and the lives of those who reside in federally assisted housing. The funding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day operations and policies of public housing authorities, encouragement of mixed-finance developments, policies to deal with distressed and troubled public housing, and rent reforms will change the face of public housing for PHAs, residents, and local communities. 
This bill empowers residents and promotes self-sufficiency and personal responsibility. It institutes permanent rent reforms to remove disincentives for residents to work, seek higher paying jobs and maintain family unity. Further, it expands homeownership opportunities for residents of both public and assisted housing. 
It improves the living environment for public housing residents by expanding opportunities for working poor families and providing flexibility for housing authorities to leverage private resources and develop mixed-income, mixed finance communities. 
It refocuses the responsibility for managing public housing back to the public housing authorities, residents and communities, it eliminates counterproductive rules and regulations, and frees public housing communities to seek innovative ways to serve residents. 
The bill requires tough, swift action against PHA with severe management deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed receivers with the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled agencies and to protect public housing residents. 
It enhances safety and security in public housing by enhancing the ability of public housing authorities to screen out and evict criminals and drug abusers who pose a threat to their communities. 
Finally, the bill enhances resident choice. It merges the section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single, choice-based program designed to operate more effectively in the private marketplace. It repeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to landlords, such as `take-one, take-all,' endless lease and 90-day termination notice requirements. These reforms will make participation in the section 8 tenant-based program more attractive to private landlords and increase housing choices for lower income families. 
To get to this stage, we have had to work through some very difficult and contentious issues. All sides have been willing to make concessions in the interest of compromise. I will mention only one of those issues--income targeting. 
At a time when housing resources are scarce, a strong argument can be made that the bulk of housing assistance should be made available for the very poor. At the same time, there is a concern that excessive concentrations of the very poor in public housing developments have negatively affected the liveability of those developments. 
The final income targeting numbers of public housing and project-based and tenant-based section 8 represent a fair compromise that will encourage mixed income communities in public housing, and ensure that tenant-based assistance remains an important tool for housing choice for very low-income families. 
Mr. President, this public housing reform bill is the first comprehensive housing reform measure to pass Congress in almost six years. It is a good, bipartisan package that represents the most significant reform of public and assisted housing in decades. I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report and I urge the President to sign the bill. 
Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes was not here when I mentioned earlier how much I appreciate his working with us, working with me, in trying to find ways to keep the process moving as we would hit roadblock after roadblock after roadblock. I want to extend to him publicly my appreciation for his work; also, again, to Senator Mikulski, and to Senator Bond. We know that we added to their difficulties. We greatly appreciate what they were able to accomplish with us. 
Lastly, I want to mention some members of the staff. Jonathan Miller, and Matt Josephs of the minority staff, again, just went out of their way to help us accomplish this. David Hardiman and Melody Fennel--I thank them as well. 
Chris Lord, Kari Davidson, and Cheh Kim of my staff did an outstanding job and worked endless hours to accomplish this, at moments of maybe thinking that we weren't going to make it but held in there to get the job done. I thank them. 
I thank the Chair for his indulgence. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last year I joined the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, in introducing a bill to authorize the placement of a memorial to Mohandas K: Mahatma--Gandhi, on Federal land in the District of Columbia in the vicinity of the Indian Embassy. A similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives. 
I am pleased to report that the House unanimously passed their version of this bill on September 15 and it now rests here in the Senate awaiting our action. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this bill and it is for this reason that I rise today. 
The proposed memorial will comply with the Commemorative Works Act and will be placed at no cost to the U.S. government; the Indian government will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of the memorial. In addition, the National Capital Memorial Commission and the National Park Service have designated and approved the site. 
At midnight on August 15, 1947, 400 million people received their independence and an institution in world history came to an end. This is the date that India became a free nation, and the mighty British empire, in effect, ceased to exist. One man more than any other is credited with bringing this profound change to the world. Dressed in white homespun cloth, with only a handful of worldly possessions, Mohandas Gandhi--known as Mahatma, or `Great Soul'--showed the world that dedication to principles, and belief in reconciliation, can prevail over otherwise insurmountable odds. Best known for his civil disobedience characterized by nonviolence and passive resistance, Mahatma Gandhi is revered by millions throughout the world for his dedication to personal freedom, justice, and human rights. 
Gandhi is not only the father of modern India, but a leader whose impact changed the world forever. Gandhi influenced great champions of freedom throughout the world including Lech Walesa of Poland, the Dalai Lama of Tibet and Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Albert Einstein said of Gandhi, `Generations to come will scarcely believe that such a one as this walked the earth in flesh and blood.' Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said of Gandhi's importance to the world, `We may ignore Gandhi at our own risk.' And Gandhi himself had strong ties to the United States. He acknowledged being influenced in his own thinking by Henry David Thoreau, as well as by the U.S. Constitution. 
Mr. President, the story of India's recent history is the story of people struggling for freedom--and this struggle is universal. Gandhi has made us all richer in our freedom through his life's work and sacrifice. The right thing for this body to do is to support the Indian government's efforts to erect this memorial; it will be a gift to the American people symbolic of the greater gift we received more than fifty years ago from Mahatma Gandhi.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. I want to commend the efforts of Senator Kyl, who introduced this important legislation and who has worked so hard to secure its passage. 
The central questions with respect to the issue of Medicare private contracting are clear. It is the proper role of the Federal government to deny Medicare beneficiaries the ability to use their own money to get the health care services they believe they need? Is it good public health policy to force doctors who treat Medicare beneficiaries on a private-pay basis out of Medicare for two years? 
I think these questions must be answered with a resounding `no'. If a Medicare patient--or any patient, for that matter--wants to spend his or her own money to pay for a health care service, it should be their decision and not the government's decision. I also believe it is wrong to put a doctor in the position of having to decide between treating a Medicare patient who chooses to pay out-of-pocket, or stop treating all their other Medicare patients for two years. 
The administration makes the argument that its opposition to this legislation is based upon its desire to `protect senior citizens'. I certainly don't question the sincerity of their concern. However, judging from the response my office has received, seniors neither want nor need the Federal government to `protect them' from themselves. Florida is home to the second largest Medicare beneficiary population in the nation. My office has been deluged with thousands of letters, telephone calls, faxes, postcards and telegrams from Medicare beneficiaries who are, quite frankly, outraged that the Administration is opposed to this legislation. 
The communications I have received from seniors in Florida all have common themes--How can something like this be happening in America? Is this not a profound assault on the freedom of American citizens? What right do you people in Washington have to tell me what I can and can't do with my own money when it comes to my own health care? Who asked you to make this decision for me? 
I couldn't agree with them more. It is clearly wrong to take important health care decisions out of the hands of patients and put them into the hands of the Federal government. Moreover, this policy results in a two-tiered system for those Americans who receive their health care from the Federal government. Patients who are beneficiaries of Medicaid, CHAMPUS, the Indian Health Service and Federal workers who participate in the FEHBP, which includes most of us in Congress and our staffs, may legally enter into private contracts with physicians of our choice. But this is not the case for Medicare beneficiaries--because the government supposedly knows what is best for them. 
Isn't it also ironic that a citizen of Great Britain, with its socialized health care delivery system, has the ability to privately pay for medical services, but Medicare patients in the United States are denied the ability to make this decision for themselves unless their physician is willing to opt-out of Medicare for two years? 
To me, this issue exemplifies one of the most fundamental differences I have with this Administration when it comes to either health care policy or the proper role of the Federal government in general. This absurd policy is simply another example of big government run amok, and it's time to put a stop to it. The Senate should pass the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act now.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last week, as many of our friends and colleagues began the Jewish New Year with the Yom Kippur day of atonement--in freedom and in peace--millions of men and women elsewhere in the world were suffering for their faith. Mr. President, I believe that our freedom to pray is not complete until all people are free to pray. 
I am told of some specific examples which make me appreciate my freedom and move me to come to the floor today. In Pakistan, a young man faces a death sentence based on trumped-up blasphemy charges. In Laos, ten courageous men and women of faith serve out harsh prison sentences for the crime of meeting for Bible study, an act which many of us take part in regularly. In China, millions of Catholics and Protestants are forced to worship in secret, paying the price of prison, fines, and even torture if they are discovered. Muslims and Tibetan monks in China suffer a similar fate. In the Sudan, Christians and animists are sold into slavery or brutally murdered by an extremist Muslim government. 
These things ought not to be, and I believe that silence is no longer an option. We must act, and we must act wisely. For this reason, I join my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, in introducing S. 1868, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This bill presents a responsible, flexible structure for responding to violations of religious freedom around the world. It allows for action that is comprehensive but calibrated. It requires consultation with those who best know the country in order to devise the most effective policy. It ensures that the action we take truly benefits the people who are suffering. The only option this bill does not allow is silence. 
The International Religious Freedom Act is not merely a short-term reaction to religious persecution. It has been carefully researched and crafted to promote long-term change, not simply to punish. There are numerous provisions for training our front lines in human rights policy--Foreign Service officers, ambassadors and refugee and asylum personnel. It incorporates religious freedom into numerous long-term avenues for change, such as broadcasting, Fulbright exchanges and legal protections for religious freedom. 
This bill has strong support from a broad base of religious and grassroots organizations. With my colleague Don Nickles, we have listened to all who desired to contribute, and have worked with both sides of the aisle to address areas of concern. This bill is truly a collaborative product of countless hours of work among members of the Congress and the administration. 
As Americans, we prize the right to freedom of religion. Our founding fathers sought to establish, as George Washington, said, `effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.' 
We now have an historic opportunity to act on behalf of millions of religious believers around the world who cannot speak for themselves. We have a solemn responsibility to stand by those suffering for their faith. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. It is the right thing to do.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my colleague John Breaux in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1998. This legislation maintains the integrity and availability of Medicare inpatient psychiatric care by changing how Medicare currently pays for services provided to beneficiaries in free standing psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part psychiatric units of general hospitals. This bill eases the transition of psychiatric facilities to a prospective payment system (PPS) while phasing in substantial cuts in payments to these providers as required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
Currently, psychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from PPS. This bill is budget neutral over five years, and ensures that until PPS is established, inpatient psychiatric care will not be compromised or disrupted because of major budget reductions. Finally, this legislation prevents the type of dislocations we now face in the Home Health Care industry. 
The purpose of this bill is to give psychiatric facilities a period of adjustment to the mandates of BBA while not jeopardizing patient care. It provides for a transition period that will help providers adjust to a prospective payment system that will be installed in three years. At the end of this time period psychiatric facilities will be paid on a prospective payment basis like other hospital providers in the Medicare program. Psychiatric hospital managers understand that the financial limitations imposed by BBA on their facilities must be met, and this bill smooths out the requirements for accomplishing this in such a way that the integrity of patient care is maintained. I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of legislation.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment which would allow some states to tax the Internet but not others. The moratorium on Internet taxation must be uniform, applying equally to all states and all local taxing jurisdictions without exception. 
Congress is taking an extraordinary, though not unprecedented, step in preempting a taxing power of the states. The people of the United States, through the Constitution, charge Congress with the responsibility of ensuring that states do not interfere with interstate commerce. This power is rarely exercised in the context of taxation, and is a power that we take very seriously. 
Use of this extraordinary power is required to prevent the heavy hands of government from stifling the economic growth potential of Internet commerce. We have now just a glimpse of the future of commerce, and a complete revolution in the way people transact business is within sight. We are on the threshold of exciting times, in which information about products will move quicker and farther than ever imagined, in which the elderly, the handicapped, and people living in remote rural areas can participate in world markets without ever leaving their homes. A moratorium is necessary to prevent the taxing authorities of 50 states, over 6,000 localities, and the federal government from taking near-sighted actions that jeopardize this future of commerce. 
A threat to interstate commerce so severe as to require a national moratorium cannot be tolerated in any state. If Congress were to grandfather those states that have already imposed Internet taxes, we would be setting a terrible precedent. This `Early Bird Special' exception gives states the incentive to rush to impose new taxes on new technologies. This is not the kind of race we want to encourage. 
And if Congress can impose a moratorium on some states but not others, will future Congresses attempt to disadvantage individual states in this manner? The defenders of a grandfather clause cast their argument as one of states' rights. But establishing the principle that a moratorium must apply equally to all states protect states from unwarranted infringements upon their power, by preventing the federal government from isolating a minority of states for adverse treatment. And I should also point out that states do not have the right to interfere with interstate commerce--the power to regulate interstate commerce was delegated to the national government, not retained by the states. 
The United States should set a strong example and preempt all Internet taxes until a rational, national approach to Internet taxation is developed. If we fail to do so, we undermine attempts to persuade our trading partners that barriers to global electronic commerce should be removed. We have the opportunity to lead the world in the area of Internet commerce, and we should make our cause the cause of freedom. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

I suspect that many of our colleagues in the Senate, and the entire Nation, for that matter, were focused on that last couple of weeks, the contest between those two individuals. 
I think, at least from my perspective as I watched events unfold, there were times people would come up to me and ask, Who do you want to win? My reaction was--like, I suspect, many others'--it would have been great if it was a tie. 
The way the two individuals interacted with each other and their attitude about the game were just, I think, a remarkable statement.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the 300th anniversary of the City of Pensacola, Florida. Although November 21, 1998 will mark the 300th anniversary of the continuous settlement of Pensacola, the origins of Pensacola are much older. 
In 1559, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano led the first authorized attempt to colonize what eventually became known as Pensacola. The first attempt at colonization failed, however, and the Spanish were forced to withdraw in 1561. The Spanish did not attempt to colonize the area again until 1698. 
Since 1698, Pensacola has flown the Spanish flag, the French flag, the British flag, the Confederate flag, and the American flag over the City. Each flag left its mark upon the City and their historical presence is still evident today. Pensacola honors its heritage each year with the Fiesta of Five Flags celebration. 
The presence of the United States Navy has also had an impact upon Pensacola. In the 1820s, a Navy Yard was established in Pensacola. The Navy Yard was closed in 1911, but in a few short years Pensacola was selected as the site of a `Naval flying school.' Today, pilots still seek flight training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station which has been called the `Cradle of Naval Aviation.' 
Pensacola's deep and sheltered bay, sugar white beaches, friendly residents, and Southern hospitality continues to charm visitors today. Over the past three hundred years, the community has hosted such visitors as General Andrew Jackson and entertainer Bob Hope. 
On November 21, 1998, Pensacola will celebrate its 300th anniversary at the site of the former Spanish settlement which today is part of the Pensacola Naval Air Station. This historic event will be commemorated with a celebration which will include a parade and fireworks. 
As a United States Senator from the State of Florida, it gives me great pleasure to wish the City of Pensacola a happy 300th anniversary. I wish the City of Pensacola all the best for a fun-filled celebration.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Breaux and I introduce a bill reaffirming that the lawmaking power is the province of the Congress, not the executive branch. Our bill prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing regulations that would impose taxes on U.S. companies merely because one of their subsidiaries pays money to itself. 
As a general rule, U.S. corporations pay U.S. corporate income tax on the earnings of their foreign subsidiaries only when those earnings are actually distributed to the U.S. parent companies. An exception to this general rule is contained in subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code, which accelerates the income tax liability of U.S. parent companies under certain circumstances. The Treasury Department has announced, in Notice 98-35, an intention to issue regulations that will accelerate income tax liability for U.S. companies--not based on the specific circumstances enumerated in subpart F, but instead on a new `interpretation' of the `policies' that Treasury infers from that 36-year-old provision. This action crosses the line between administering the laws and making the laws, and cannot be allowed by Congress. 
Notice 98-35 concerns so-called `hybrid arrangements.' These involve business entities that are considered separate corporations for foreign tax purposes, but are viewed as one company with a branch office for U.S. purposes. U.S. companies organize their subsidiaries in this manner to reduce the amount of foreign taxes they owe. Transactions between a subsidiary and its branch have no impact on U.S. taxable income of the parent, as its subsidiary is merely paying money to itself. But the Treasury Department intends to impose a tax on the U.S. parent to penalize it for reducing the foreign taxes it owes. 
This effort is wrong for several reasons. First, the Treasury Department possesses only the power to issue regulations to administer the laws passed by Congress. New rules based on congressional purpose are known as laws, and under the Constitution laws are made by Congress. 
Second, the Treasury Department is elevating one policy underlying subpart F--taxing domestic and foreign operations in the same manner--over the other policy of maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. companies in foreign markets. This proposed tax would put U.S.-owned subsidiaries at a competitive disadvantage. 
Finally, the Treasury Department should not impose a tax on U.S. companies to force these companies to reorganize in a way that increases the taxes they owe to foreign countries. The Treasury Department is not the tax collector for other nations. And by raising the foreign tax bills of U.S. companies, the Treasury Department is also increasing the size of foreign tax credits and thereby reducing U.S. tax revenues. 
The Treasury Department is not only making policy that it has no right to make, it is also making bad policy. Our bill places a moratorium on this lawmaking. It also directs the Treasury Secretary to study these issues and submit a report to the tax-writing committees of Congress. Many people and organizations, including the Treasury Department, desire changes in the tax laws. But only Congress has the power to make these changes, and this is a power we intend to keep.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate in support of today's colloquy regarding Federal judgeship needs in Florida. Although I was unable to participate in the colloquy between my esteemed colleagues, Senators Hatch and Graham, I wish to express my support for their position. It is my hope that the Judiciary Committee will lend serious consideration to Florida's unique and acute judgeship needs. 
The pressures currently upon Florida's court system, particularly in the Middle District, are some of the most severe in the nation. The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended three permanent district judgeships and one temporary judgeship for the Middle District. This is the most judgeships recommended for any federal district in the nation. 
Statistics kept by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts underscore the need for additional judgeships in this district. Recent statistics place Florida's Middle District second in the nation in weighted case filings per judge, with an average of 855. This is far above the national average of 519 weighted case filings per judge. It is expected that these numbers will continue to climb, given this area's explosive population growth. Although fifty-five percent of Florida's population currently resides in the Middle District, the district is home to only one-third of the state's federal judges. According to projected population growth figures, the Middle District will comprise two-thirds of the state's population by the year 2005. 
The Middle District contains some of the world's most frequently visited cities, beaches and tourist attractions, including Disney World in Orlando and Busch Gardens in Tampa. The heavy flow of both tourists and the `snowbird' population serve to make the needs of this judicial district unique. 
Adding to this problem, what will be the nation's largest federal prison, the Coleman Prison Complex, is scheduled to be completed in 1999 in the Middle District. This will place an additional strain on the already overburdened courts of this district due to increased prisoner petitions. Further complicating the problem, a portion of the Middle District has recently been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. An increase in drug cases will result as criminals are apprehended and prosecuted, placing additional demands upon this district. 
It is not possible to provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice unless there is a court system in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Increased judicial resources are integral in providing such a court system.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S.1873, the American Missile Protection Act of 1998 drafted by Senators Cochran and Inouye. While I have been an ardent supporter of a vigorous missile defense program with a specific architecture and under a specific deployment schedule, a sufficient minority of members has been able to derail this effort over the last few years. Therefore, the modest proposal under consideration today, is an attempt to compromise by affirmatively establishing as U.S. policy the deployment of an effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system as soon as technologically possible. 
I have long argued that such a system is both necessary and prudent because the threat of an attack or an inadvertent launch did not end with the termination of the cold war, but is real and continues to grow. In fact, the threat is greater today than any time in United States history. The technology revolution aids equally those who want to bring good into the world, as well as those who would do harm. 
Recent activities in Africa, namely the bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the launch of ballistic missiles (or a satellite) by North Korea, as well as the shoot-down of two unarmed American aircraft in the Florida straits two years ago, reminds us of the threat the United States and our allies face from rogue and terrorist states, and non-state actors. 
Beyond these, the future of Russia and China remains unclear. While we wait to see if the forces of freedom and democracy prevail in the internal struggles happening in these countries, we must remember that they maintain the capability to launch weapons of mass destruction. Other states continue efforts to develop destructive capabilities. Recently, Iran has made dramatic progress in its missile development. We know that China's proliferation has aided the development of Pakistan's nuclear program, adding to the instability of South Asia. 
My primary concern with the Administration's `plan' on deploying an anti-ballistic missile defense system is that it is premised on deploying a system within three years of clearly identifying an emerging threat. I believe the Administration greatly overestimates its intelligence gathering capability. 
In early 1997, a CIA official testified that Iran was not expected to have the capability to field a medium range ballistic missile until 2007. Less than a year later, that nine year time frame was significantly reduced by the CIA, and another Administration official predicted Iran could have the capability in as early as one-and-a-half years. Similarly, in 1997 the Department of Defense only credited Pakistan with a 300 km capability. However, less than six months later Pakistan launched a missile capable of traveling 1,500 km. 
Based on past performance, I am very hesitant to base the fielding of a missile defense system on the Administration's determination of the existence of an emerging threat. I believe such a plan is grossly inadequate and could have catastrophic consequences for the American people.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to support the proposed amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against tabling it. 
The current world economic crises and the International Monetary Fund's request for financial replenishment offer us a chance to re-examine the United States' role in the world economy. If the U.S. is going to participate in institutions that influence economic policy around the world, then we must exert our influence in strong support of sound economic policies, not just rubber-stamp whatever plans international bureaucrats cook up. It does us no good to stand idly by and let the IMF squander our resources on ill-conceived rescue plans, such as the tax-hike package recently foisted on Russia. 
What should the IMF be promoting? The same policies that we support here in the United States. To name just a few, these include: a monetary policy dedicated to long-term price stability, a sensible tax system that encourages people to work, save and invest, free and open markets and sound banking systems that use consistent accounting methods, have transparent balance sheets and lend based on market forces, not political pressure. 
The best way to start down this path is to set strong conditions on the IMF. This amendment moves us in this direction. In particular, it would promote free trade, market-based lending and the fair treatment of international investors. I urge my colleagues to vote against tabling it.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato, to ensure that every classroom in America is staffed with a competent, qualified and caring teacher. During the past several months, Congress has debated a number of initiatives to further this goal, including an amendment that Senator D'Amato and I introduced and passed as part of the Education Savings Accounts package. Our amendment passed with bipartisan support, and we are here today to pursue this legislation in light of the President's veto of the ESA bill. 
As early as the 1890s, the United States was the world's premiere industrial power, boasting a manufacturing sector roughly equal to that of Great Britain, Germany and France combined. While relatively new, this industrial order grew at a remarkable pace, leading many to concur with Teddy Roosevelt's prediction that the Twentieth Century would be `America's Century.' 
As we stand at the edge of a new millennium, another economic revolution in underway. But unlike the industrial revolution of one hundred years ago, this new revolution is defined not by large factories and natural resources, but by something a little less tangible and a little more human. I believe the 21st Century will be known as the `Century of Knowledge,' where ingenuity and innovation will prove to be the most critical of resources. Now, if our children are to be prepared for the challenges ahead, educational excellence must become our first order of business. 
The President has placed education near the top of his domestic agenda. I am pleased that he, too, recognizes the importance of providing our children with an education second to none. This is an area where we can easily agree. However, I am discouraged that none of his proposals confronts the most basic, the most important, and the most neglected aspect of public education: the quality of instruction in the classroom. It cannot be overstated that the best teachers produce the best students. Unless the quality of teaching improves, all other very worthwhile reforms, from smaller classes and higher salaries to newer buildings and computers in the classroom--are meaningless. 
Good teachers are the backbone to a good education. Every student in America has a fundamental right to be taught by a skilled and well-prepared teacher. Teachers make all the difference in the learning process. America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hardworking teachers. Studies show again and again that teacher expertise is one of the most important factors in determining student achievement. 
Nevertheless, the case for sweeping reform is not difficult to make. The United States already spends more money per pupil than virtually any industrialized democracy in the world. Nonetheless, our children frequently score near the bottom in international exams in science and math. If the teacher-student relationship--which in my opinion is the most basic building-block in the educational process--is defective, no amount of resources will be able to turn bad schools into good schools. Throwing more money at the problem is no longer the answer. Again, real reforms are needed. 
Mr. President, real education reform begins in America's classrooms. Any reform must include measures to ensure that teachers are qualified to teach the subjects they are teaching. To my dismay, I have learned that all across the country, many teachers are being assigned to teach classes for which they have no formal training. Consider these statistics: 
One out of five English classes were taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in English, literature, communications, speech, journalism, English education, or reading education. 
One out of four mathematics classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in mathematics or mathematics education. 
Nearly 4 out of 10 life science or biology classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in biology or life science. 
More than half of physical science classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in physics, chemistry, geology or earth science. 
More than half of history or world civilization classes were taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in history. 
Students in schools with the highest minority enrollments have less than a 50% chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and a degree in the field he or she teaches. 
Our schools and classrooms should be staffed with teachers who have the appropriate training and background. One way to determine this would be to test teachers on their knowledge of the subject areas they teach. 
Teacher testing is an important first step toward upgrading the quality of classroom instruction. Testing would identify teachers who are not making the grade, and would enable principals to help weaker teachers improve. Much has been made about social promotion, where 
students are often pushed on to the next grade with his or her peers despite the fact that the student has not met the criteria needed to advance. In my opinion, teachers face social promotion too. They are kept on staff regardless of performance. That is wrong. States should measure the expertise of their teachers through periodic teacher testing. 
Common sense also dictates that we should not concentrate all our attention on underperforming teachers. We must also recognize that there are many great teachers who are successfully challenging their students on a daily basis. Today, our public schools compensate teachers based almost solely on seniority, not on their performance inside the classroom. Merit-pay would differentiate between teachers who are hard-working and inspiring, and those who fall short. 
The legislation we are introducing today, known as the MERIT ACT--which stands for Measures to Enhance Results in Teaching--is the same legislation that passed the Senate during debate on the Education Savings Accounts bill. It rewards states that test its teachers on their subject matter knowledge, and pays its teachers based on merit. 
Here is how it works: we will make half of any additional funding over the FY 1999 level for the Eisenhower Professional Development Program available to states that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers, and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. There will be NO reduction in current funding to states under this program based on this legislation. As funding increases for this program, so will the amount each state receives. Incentives will and should be provided to those states that take the initiative to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. 
Again, I want to emphasize that all current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this legislation. Only additional money will be used as an incentive for states to enact teacher testing and merit pay programs. 
Finally, this amendment enables states to also use federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. This broad approach will enable states to staff their schools with the best and most qualified teachers, thereby enhancing learning for all students. In turn, teachers can be certain that all of their energy, dedication and expertise will be rewarded. And it can be done without placing new mandates on states or increasing the federal bureaucracy. 
Mr. President, as I pointed out earlier, the Senate has already debated this innovative approach when we considered the Education Savings Accounts bill. I was impressed that we passed the amendment with bipartisan support by a vote of 63-35, and that it was included in the Conference report sent to the President for his signature. I was disappointed, however, when the President vetoed that important legislation on July 22, 1998, despite his own earlier involvement in developing a teacher testing program in his home state of Arkansas while he was Governor. 
As Governor, Bill Clinton enthusiastically supported teacher testing, and while Governor of South Carolina, Secretary of Education Richard Riley advocated a merit-pay plan. In fact, then-Governor Clinton in 1984 said that he was more convinced than ever that competency tests were needed to take inventory of teacher' basic skills. He said, `Teachers who don't pass the test shouldn't be in the classroom'. Since coming to Washington, however, neither the President nor Secretary Riley has tried to do for the children of America what they as Governors fought to do for the children of their own states. Our nation's children deserve better. 
While Bill Clinton let an opportunity for true reform pass him by, I am encouraged by the recent action taken by the American Federation of Teachers. They, too, recognize that true reform begins in the classroom and that teacher quality must be at the heart of that reform. They recently passed a resolution affirming the need for improved teacher quality, which also states that they will take a more active role in reviewing teacher performance and dismissing teachers that cannot be helped. This same proposal was rejected two years ago by the Federation's membership. Again, I am encouraged by this change of heart. I am hopeful that we can work together with the AFT and any other organization interested in moving forward to improve teacher quality. While we may not agree on every approach, I would like to commence an ongoing dialogue on this important issue. 
Mr. President, I must also point out how timely this legislation is in light of the recent reports out of the state of Massachusetts, which tested prospective teachers with a tenth-grade level exam. Sadly, 60 percent of those taking the test failed. It's unfortunate that the poor results of the test overshadow the positive contributions teachers make day in and day out to challenge the imagination of their students. That's why it's important to help teachers become the best they can be and to reward the outstanding teachers who are making a difference in the lives of our youth. Our children deserve nothing less. That's what this legislation does. 
The President's lack of support for merit pay and teacher testing has only temporarily set back the call for excellence in education. But I will continue to press forward with plans to ensure that our classrooms are led by capable teachers, and I will continue the fight to give dedicated professionals who teach our children a personal stake in the quality of the instruction they provide. If we accomplish these reforms, and place the interests of students above the preservation of the status quo, then the extraordinary dynamism of the American people will continue, and the 21st Century will, once again, be the `American Century'. 
I hope there will again be broad, bipartisan support for this important initiative.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in a colloquy regarding threat emitters used to support electronic combat training by the Air Force Special Operations Command as well as testing by the Air Force and other services. These emitters replicate the surface-to-air missile threats and jammers which our combat aircraft might encounter if deployed to execute a real mission--a mission which would take them into harm's way. It is essential that these systems be available to train our first to fight, the special operations forces.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my colleague is correct. We cannot let ambiguity about words hinder the training and readiness of our forces. These emitters should be supported at Eglin until we can resolve these issues. I would ask the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee if he can assist us by working on this issue in the appropriations conference if we can find a solution. We will work with the Department of Defense as well as the defense authorizing committees to find a solution which can be accommodated in the defense appropriations conference.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the federal government should be encouraging private industry's involvement and investment in space, not competing with it and in some cases, stifling it. I am afraid that if we do not act on and pass this amendment, we will continue to encourage American companies to move their operations overseas. Companies need consistent government policy that encourages the development of new technology through private investment. We should enable private companies to locate and conduct their business here at home. 
This growing sector of the economy provides jobs to many highly-skilled and technically-trained workers. To put it into perspective, industry revenues have exceeded $7.5 billion. Commercial space businesses have grown faster than the economy and have been relatively recession proof. 
Senator Graham and I have proposed a number of balanced changes to current law. Among them, our amendment requires a study by NASA to identify commercial opportunities and interest in servicing the International Space Station. Second, we authorize the Office of Commercial Space Transportation to license commercial providers to re-enter Earth's atmosphere and return payloads to Earth. Currently, only the Federal Government is permitted to do so. 
Third, we encourage the President to enter into regional agreements with foreign governments to secure the U.S. Global Positioning System as the world's standard. Finally, we require the federal government to procure commercial space transportation services. 
Space is a frontier for research and exploration. The Federal Government's investments in space technology have provided the private sector with impressive capabilities that can benefit both our citizens and the economy. It is now the private sector's challenge to make commercial space activities earn a profit. The role of the Federal Government should be to provide stable and supportive policies for these activities. 
Mr. President, we are moving into the 21st century. However, the laws regulating this industry are decades old. It is critical that we update them. The Senate Commerce Committee reported this bill favorably on June 2, 1998, and the House passed a similar version on November 4, 1997. I hope it will receive broad, bipartisan support.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to state my views on the elimination of the marriage penalty. 
Before 1969, the federal income tax treated married couples like partnerships, in which husbands and wives shared their incomes equally. This practice was called income-splitting. It was ended in 1969, creating what is commonly known as the marriage penalty--the extra taxes couples have to pay because they are married rather than single. According to the Congressional Budget Office, about 21 million couples now pay these penalties, which average about $1,400 per couple. 
This unfair treatment of married couples is fundamentally wrong. The tax code ought to treat married couples no worse than it treats single people. It ought to recognize that marriages are partnerships in which husbands and wives share their incomes equally for the good of their families. Until it does this, the tax code is punishing the most important institution our society has. 
This amendment is explicitly pro-family. It is a direct way of letting families keep more of their hard-earned money, which can be used for child-care, taking care of a sick parent, education expenses or whatever else the family wants to do with it. It sends a message to the American people that marriage should be a welcome occasion, not just another excuse for higher taxes. 
Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to eliminate the marriage penalty.

Mr. MACK. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Graham/Mack immigration amendment to the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill. I strongly believe that this amendment is the right thing to do for the Haitian community and that it is consistent with our treatment of similarly-situated immigrant groups. 
I would like to provide the Senate with some background information on what has led Senator Graham and me to introduce this amendment, a brief explanation of the amendment, and the policy rationale behind the amendment. 
First of all, some legislative history on events leading up to the introduction of this amendment. Last year, Senator Graham and I introduced legislation which was intended to ease the transition into implementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, otherwise known as IRAIRA. Our bill simply clarified that immigrants who were in the administrative pipeline for suspension of deportation when IRAIRA was enacted would have their cases for suspension considered under the rules in place when they applied for suspension, not the new rules contemplated by IRAIRA. I was concerned with the unfairness of changing the rules on people midstream. 
While this bill was under consideration in the Senate, an agreement was reached in the House of Representatives which gave even greater relief to the Nicaraguan community--the ability to adjust to legal permanent resident status. 
Once it was apparent that Nicaraguans would be granted the opportunity to adjust to legal permanent resident status, the Haitian community made an attempt to be included in the relief. Although they, too, had a compelling case, it was not possible to include them in the final bill at that point in the negotiations. However, Senator Graham and I made a commitment to seek appropriate relief for the Haitians this Congress, and received assurances from the Administration that they would defer potential deportation decisions of the affected Haitians until after Congress had an opportunity to consider legislative relief. 
This amendment, identical in text to Senate bill 1504, which was reported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee, would provide permanent resident status to certain Haitians who fled Haiti after the Aristide regime was toppled in a brutal military coup in 1991 and were either paroled into the country or applied for asylum by December 31, 1995. 
This amendment is more narrow than the legislation passed last year which gave permanent resident status to Nicaraguans, since the scope and number of people covered is much smaller. Under last year's bill, nearly every Nicaraguan in the United States before December 1, 1995 was made eligible to adjust their status, approximately 150,000 people. Our amendment helps only a limited class of Haitians, estimated at 30,000-40,000, who have sought the help of the United States in fleeing persecution. Let me emphasize that point again--this amendment is for those who have actively sought U.S. help, not those who came illegally and sought to evade detection. 
There are two different categories of Haitians involved. The first category are those paroled into the country after being identified as having a credible fear of persecution. Nearly all in this category, approximately 11,000 Haitians, were pre-screened at Guantanamo Bay and found to meet a credible fear of persecution test. These 11,000 Haitians represent approximately 25% of those screened at Guantanamo, the other 75% were returned to Haiti. The second category are those Haitians who have applied for asylum by December 31, 1995. In the case of those in the second category, they are people who have been caught in an asylum backlog not under their control and may have a difficult time now, due to the passage of time, demonstrating a credible fear of persecution. In the meantime, they have put down roots in this country and are making positive contributions to their communities. 
I am talking about a twenty-five year old woman, Nestilia Robergeau, who fled Haiti, where she had been beaten and raped and her brother was murdered. Even though she was screened into this country through Guantanamo in 1992, she is still waiting for an asylum interview. In the meantime, she has graduated from high school and hopes to attend college to become a nurse. She works most days from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. to support herself and her teenage brother. 
And then there is a little fourth grade girl in Miami, Florida, Louiciana Miclisse. Both of her parents were shot and killed in Haiti, and the only relative she has now is her Aunt Nadia, who came with her from Haiti. She wants to grow up to be a doctor. She has applied for asylum, but her case has still not been considered. Do we really want to send this child back to Haiti where she has no family? Is that what this country is all about? I believe we are more compassionate than that. 
It's also important to mention that conditions in Haiti are not safe for the return of these people. At an immigration subcommittee field hearing last December, the committee was informed that the Haitian government has not yet established the civil institutions necessary to protect these refugees from further retribution by those who perpetrated human rights crimes. In fact, it appears that these criminals continue to operate with impunity. 
As I mentioned at the outset, this amendment is consistent with our treatment of similarly-situated immigrant groups. As Grover Joseph Rees, former General Counsel of INS under President Bush, testified at the subcommittee field hearing last December, it has been the rule rather than the exception that when a human rights emergency has led to the admission of large numbers of parolees from a particular country, such refugees and others similarly situated have been subsequently granted permanent residency through Congressional action. Congress has granted permanent residence on this basis in the past to Hungarians, Poles, Soviets, Vietnamese, Chinese, Cambodians, Laotians, Cubans, and, most recently, Nicaraguans. This action for the Haitians is entirely consistent with our past treatment of similarly-situated groups from other countries. 
This amendment is the right thing to do, and this is the right time to do it. The Haitians who are affected by this situation have been left in limbo far too long. I urge my colleagues to support the Graham/Mack amendment.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to honor John Gibson and Jacob `J.J.' Chestnut, the officers who gave their lives Friday in the line of duty. 
For Members of the Senate, I would remind them that John Gibson was one of the individuals who was a part of our security detail on our most recent retreat. Yesterday morning, after an early morning run, I stopped by the Capitol where people had placed flowers at the steps, and I talked with a young officer who told me how proud he was of J.J. J.J. was the kind of person who, after 20 years of service in the military, took under his wing the new men and women who were coming into the Capitol Hill Police Force service and to help them on a personal basis, giving them tips about the kinds of things to which they needed to pay attention with their training, the kinds of things they ought to try to accomplish when they are dealing with our constituents when they come into the Capitol. 
Many times, I am sure, we forget the difficulty of the duty that they have, on the one hand to be trained to the extent to react the way they reacted on Friday, unselfishly, putting themselves in harm's way so that others may survive, but at the same time having the responsibility of treating our constituents, our friends, our neighbors, when they come to the Capitol, with such graciousness. It is a really difficult job, and I just want to express to the members of the Capitol Hill Police Force, all of those who participate in providing security, our deep appreciation for what they do on a day-to-day basis. Each day we come to work, we pass these officers. As the majority leader said, some of them we know by name, others we have become friends with. 
I particularly remember C.J. Martin over at the Delaware entrance in the Russell Building, how each morning we would discuss some very personal things about our lives, the kinds of common bonds, if you will, that we shared. And so, while I didn't know J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson to the degree that I have known other members of the police force here, I know that they were very special people. Again, listening to that young officer talk about how J.J. would stand at that door, erect in that military stance, with great pride, frankly, in the job that he performed, and the reaction that he had, again, with the people as they came in, we don't take what they do for granted, and we want them to know that we are concerned about them and we are concerned about their families. 
I had the opportunity on Friday evening to visit the families of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson and to express to them our deep concern and our love for them, wanting them to know that we cherish their fathers, their husbands, that they mean a great deal to us, that we will do what we can to comfort them, that we won't forget them, that we will remember the families. 
While the officers are the ones who lost their lives, now it is a tough and difficult time for the families. Each one of us, I know, has had the experience of losing someone close to us and we can feel the pain of the tragedy that took place, and we want those families to know that we have not forgotten them and that we will do what we can over the years to see that they are not forgotten. 
Friday, in talking with the young sons of `Gibson,' as they refer to him, I can only imagine the hurt and pain that those boys 14 and 15 years old must be feeling. I say to all of us, regardless of the role that we play in the Senate or in the House, we are all one big family. 
In a sense, there are many families within the family. There is the family of officers and the special grief that they must be experiencing today, as they are required to carry out their duties at a moment in which their minds and hearts must be focused on their lost officers and their families. So I ask everyone, if they would, during this day and the next several days, to pray for those families--for comfort, for love, and for hope. 
Again, I can remember a particular time in which my younger brother passed away. I was so angry about his loss; people would come up to me and say, `Connie, time will take care, time will heal,' and I was so angry I said, `I don't want it to be healed. I don't want time to take care of it. I am angry.' 
But I hope that the families, especially the children, will deal with those feelings inside, that they will share those thoughts to get them out so they don't carry around that hurt and that pain. We want them to know that we truly love them, that we will miss their fathers, their husbands, and we will try to make the Senate and House and the Capitol a place in which they can be proud. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the pending legislation, H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act. My comments will be addressed to the overall bill as well as the individual amendments that have been offered or will be offered. 
On May 11, 1933, during the 73rd Congress, the Federal Credit Union Act was introduced. I have an interesting connection to this legislation. The Federal Credit Union Act was introduced by Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas. Senator Sheppard was my grandfather. I happen to be standing at the desk that he used while he was in the Senate. 
The impetus for Federal legislation was the fact that in 1933, commercial banks had little interest in consumer lending. Simply stated, the small borrower was not a desired customer of commercial banks 65 years ago. Additionally, America was a country comprised of very large employers. It made sense for these large groups of individuals with a common bond, to join together to form credit unions to meet their credit needs. So back in the 1930s, when credit unions were formed, credit union members were typically groups of city workers, postal employees, and employees of the telephone company. 
Over the next 60 years, however, we saw the number of large companies decline, and today, most people work for very small companies. In fact, in my state of Florida, 99% of all businesses have less than 1000 employees. Additionally, 97% of all companies in Florida employ fewer than 100 people. 
Since 1933, when my grandfather introduced the Federal Credit Union Act, the world has fundamentally changed. The credit unions of today are different from those of times past. 
I might also add, so are commercial banks. Today, commercial banks aggressively try to entice individuals of all incomes to do business with their financial institutions. They have aggressively reached out to consumers. To make my point, all one has to do is look at the mail you receive and realize how many credit card applications you have received. There is an aggressive outreach on the part of commercial banks to be engaged in lending to the average consumer today. 
The credit unions of today are different from those of times past. 
Now there are multibillion-dollar credit unions that in many cases dwarf the size of thousands of commercial banks and thrifts. Some of these multi-billion dollar credit unions have hundreds of employee groups and are located in multiple States. In many of these instances, these large credit unions cannot be differentiated from commercial banks--they offer home equity loans, have large credit card portfolios, loan money to small businesses, offer safe deposit boxes, and sell mutual funds. In fact, a credit union in Alaska even serves as a Federal Reserve depository. 
Mr. President, Congress has always supported credit unions. I, too, strongly believe there is a role for credit unions. By trying to improve this bill, no one, including me, is attempting to eliminate the credit union charter. 
Small, community based credit unions are vital to our communities because they provide individuals access to credit. Credit unions have played a very important role in extending credit to people who need financial help. 
However, in spite of my support of the credit union charter, I remain troubled by several provisions in the Senate Banking Committee passed bill that is before us today. I must admit, the bill we are debating today is far better than the bill the Senate Banking Committee received from the House. With the addition of caps on commercial lending and by including the Department of Treasury's prompt corrective action language, we will be able to ensure the safety and soundness of the healthy Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. I am pleased with this progress, but much more progress must be made if I am to support this bill in the end. 
My overriding apprehension about the pending legislation deals with the issue of fairness. Most credit unions pay their members higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts and offer lower interest rates on mortgages, student loans, and credit cards than most commercial banks. Credit unions on average, charge lower fees and require lower minimum deposits. There is one simple reason for this capacity of credit unions to pay higher rates and charge lower fees: they are exempt from federal income taxes. This is an unfair competitive advantage. 
During the Senate Banking Committee's discussion on this bill, the committee adopted a provision that directs the Department of Treasury to conduct a study of the differences between credit unions and other federally insured depository institutions with respect to the enforcement of all financial laws and regulations. Treasury will also compare the impact of all Federal laws, including Federal tax laws, as they are applied to credit unions and other federally insured depository institutions. This study will identify the regulatory and tax advantages credit unions have over banks, and suggest ways Congress can address these differences. This study will be a start, but by no means will it level the playing field. Upon completion of the study, I hope the Senate will hold hearings on how to reduce the inequities which exist among federally insured depository institutions. 
As I stated earlier, the Senate bill is far better than the House passed bill, but I still have some real concerns regarding provisions in the legislation. Specifically, my primary problem is the inclusion of language similar to the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Imposing the same onerous burdens on credit unions would help to level the playing field; however, I do not support the Community Reinvestment Act as it has evolved, and I oppose subjecting credit unions to these requirements. In fact, I would prefer to see the entire Community Reinvestment Act repealed. 
Because of CRA, banks are now often forced to make unsound and risky loans in economically disadvantaged areas. If they do not make these high risk investments, they are accused of discrimination. I strongly believe that most of these allegations are false. 
In contrast to banks, credit unions, by their nature, already lend to their members. It is ludicrous to impose CRA on credit unions. 
Think about it for a moment. Credit unions were established for individuals with a common bond. It makes no sense whatsoever that the institution in which you are a member would turn around and discriminate against you. It just doesn't make sense. 
In a letter to the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), I asked several questions as to whether or not there have been any meritorious discrimination complaints against credit unions. In his response, the chairman stated there was no evidence of credit unions being guilty of discriminating against their members. Given the credit union chief regulator's response, I think it makes no sense to impose the burdens of CRA on credit unions. 
Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment of Senator Phil Gramm to delete these onerous provisions from the bill. What looks harmless today will quickly evolve to burdensome, costly, and unnecessary regulations in the future. 
The same concern with CRA is also addressed by Senator Shelby's amendment to exempt banks with less than $250 million in assets from the Community Reinvestment Act. I strongly support the amendment of Senator Shelby now, just as I did in the Banking Committee's markup. 
Be assured that exempting small banks from CRA is not about opening the door to allow them to discriminate. Not only is discrimination wrong, it is illegal. Fair lending laws like the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act are still the law of the land. I believe these laws protect the American people, and as I mentioned, laws such as CRA are an unnecessary burden on business. 
My final concern with this legislation deals with the large increase in the number of commercial loans that credit unions are making. I support the Hagel-Bennett amendment because it accomplishes two things. First, it limits the amount credit unions can lend to their members for small commercial ventures, such as agriculture or small business start ups. 
Again, the reason we are tightening commercial lending is not because we are trying to vent some distrust with respect to how credit unions make their loans. 
But from my experience, having been in the business of commercial lending for almost 16 years, these are two very complicated and risky areas of lending. 
As I say, I support the Hagel-Bennett amendment, because it accomplishes two things: Well-managed, well-capitalized credit unions can lend up to 7 percent of their capital; exempts from the 7 percent cap credit unions which were chartered for the purpose of commercial lending. 
Second, the Hagel-Bennett amendment addresses the manner in which credit unions make commercial loans. Many credit union loan officers are not trained to evaluate commercial loans. The Hagel-Bennett amendment requires credit union employees who make or administer commercial loans to have at least 2 years of experience in the area of commercial lending. This provision is already part of the NCUA's regulations on member business loans, and the Hagel-Bennett amendment merely codifies this regulation. 
Be aware that much of what I am saying is the result of my experience as a member of the Senate Banking Committee when the Resolution Trust Corporation was established to bail out the savings and loan industry. I believe that if we do not take precautions now, such as those outlined in the Hagel-Bennett amendment, we could be looking at significant losses and exposure to the taxpayers in the future. 
In closing, I stress my support of the vital role credit unions play in today's financial services marketplace. Do not mistake my desire to improve this legislation with an agenda to end credit unions. I strongly feel that credit unions should exist. There are 268 credit unions in my State of Florida, with just under 3 1/2 million members. My goal today is to ensure that every credit union is a viable, safe and sound institution, one unburdened by unnecessary regulatory requirements. 
Mr. President, I cannot support H.R. 1151 in its present form. I hope that my colleagues will support both the Gramm and Hagel-Bennett amendments which ensure the safety and soundness of credit unions. I also urge my colleagues to support the Shelby amendment which will level the playing field between commercial banks and credit unions. 
Thank you. Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Katrina Ruiz and Marco Caknesella of Miami, Florida. Katrina and Marco were selected as national finalists in the 1998 Do the Write Thing Challenge Program sponsored by the National Campaign to Stop Violence. The National Campaign to Stop Violence is a coalition of businesses and nonprofit organizations who have joined together in an effort to work with young people to end youth violence in America. 
Katrina, Marco and hundreds of other middle school students in Miami took part in the Do the Write Thing Challenge Program this year. The Do the Write Thing Challenge Program asks middle school students in 12 cities across the United States to provide a written commitment to reducing violence in their lives by submitting a written answer to the question `What can I do about the violence in my life?' 
It is always a pleasure to hear about programs, like the Do the Write Thing Challenge Program, which encourage young people to begin to think about the ways that they, as individuals, can have an impact upon the problems which confront their community. I am confident that Katrina, Marco and the thousands of other young people across the nation who participated in the program will set a positive example for their peers as they fulfill their written commitment to reduce violence in their own lives. 
I commend Katrina Ruiz and Marco Caknesella for their selection for this high honor and wish them all the best for their continued success.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to again address the ongoing situation in my home state of Florida. As I mentioned earlier this month on the Senate floor, devastating wildfires have ravaged Florida, imp;acting all of our 67 counties since May 24, 1998. Since this crisis began, more than 2,000 separate fires to date have been identified and more than 500,000 acres have been burned. 
The massive campaign which has been undertaken to contain these fires is encouraging. Firefighters from across the country have been part of this effort. On behalf of the state of Florida and its people, I would like to thank all of the states, communities, and families that have committed resources to these efforts. 
Today, I join with the Florida Congressional delegation in support of H. Con. Res. 298. This resolution expresses our condolences to the people of the state of Florida who have suffered throughout this ordeal; and commends the important and heroic efforts of the firefighters, as well as the numerous federal, state, and community entities aiding in the struggle to contain and extinguish the fires. 
I appreciate the work of my Senate colleagues who have enabled us to bring this resolution to the floor quickly. I hope this swift action by Congress will help bring attention to the continuing efforts of government and community leaders, and will help lift the spirits of those closely engaged in this battle. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, southwest Florida is one of the fastest growing areas in the country. Not surprisingly it is also my understanding that RSW is the third fastest growing airport in the United States. Additionally, I am told RSW has experienced an average annual growth of 9.2 percent over the past ten years. 
Due to this unprecedented growth, RSW has embarked upon a major expansion program which includes construction of a new terminal and runway. This project is one of the State of Florida's most important airport projects and it has received substantial funding from the State. Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration has provided discretionary funding for this worthy project due, in no small part, to the support of the distinguished Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, and his subcommittee over the past two years through the prior Transportation Appropriations bills. I very much appreciate the support of the Senator for RSW and its expansion project. 
Additionally, as the Senator may be aware, earlier this year RSW submitted a request for a Letter of Intent to the FAA in order to support their expansion project from the agency. Over the course of the last several years, recognizing the budget constraints which the FAA must operate under, RSW officials have worked hard to significantly reduce the federal share of this project by more than 30 percent. 
I believe the Chairman of the Subcommittee can appreciate the efforts of RSW, in working with the FAA, to craft a plan which meets the needs of the airport yet substantially cuts costs in an effort to remain within the FAA's anticipated budget constraints. I feel confident this is the type of cooperation from a project which the FAA should consider for priority LOI consideration.

Mr. MACK. Madam President, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs is entirely correct. On June 30, 1998, HUD issued three important regulations. For all these regulations, HUD waived the sixty-day comment period. Specifically, these rules would: first, establish requirements relating to physical conditions and inspections and would apply to a wide variety of HUD rental assistance and mortgage insurance programs; second, establish uniform financial reporting standards for HUD housing programs; and third, establish a new Public Housing Assessment System. 
Despite the enormous impact of these proposed rules, HUD has waived the sixty-day public comment period as provided by HUD's own regulations (24 CFR 10.1), often referred to as `Part 10.' Previously, HUD attempted to repeal, as a practical matter, its Part 10 regulations related to notice and comment rulemaking. At that time, members of the Senate joined together in a bipartisan manner to enact legislation to safeguard public notice and comment in HUD's rulemaking process. 
It is essential that HUD maintain an adequate period of time for the public to review, analyze and comment upon proposed changes in HUD's policies and procedures. Congress established the notice and comment rulemaking procedure in order to allow the public to provide adequate input so as to avoid potential confusion in the development of new rules. Given the importance of the proposed rules at issue, a more extensive period of time for public review and comment is warranted.

At the outset, I want to say to the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, both to Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, that I congratulate them for their effort in putting together what is generally a good and balanced HUD appropriations bill. 
As chairman of the HUD's authorizing subcommittee, I appreciate the difficulty of funding the most important parts of HUD's mission, while also addressing the critical need of the Department to reform its management and operations. 
I especially appreciate Senator Bond's cooperation in helping ensure the effective implementation of the section 8 `mark-to-market' program we enacted last year. However, on the issue of FHA loan limits, Senator Bond and I disagree. 
I am concerned that the Appropriations Committee did not consider the views of the authorizing committee. This is a major policy change that is being implemented through the appropriations process despite evidence gathered in hearings that would indicate that the change is ill-advised. 
Last month, the Housing Opportunity and Community Development Subcommittee held two days of oversight hearings on FHA. The Subcommittee heard extensive testimony from HUD, GAO, the HUD Inspector General and outside witnesses on the programs, operations and mission of FHA, and on proposals for reform. I heard little testimony at those hearings that made a compelling case to raise the FHA loan limit. As chairman of the authorizing subcommittee, I would not have recommended an increase in the loan limits. 
This bill does not contain the Administration's initial proposal for raising the loan limits--a proposal I strongly oppose. However, the proposal contained in the bill does focus attention away from the traditional mission of FHA of serving low- and moderate-income families and first-time home buyers. Further, it covers up some of the fundamental problems in the FHA single-family insurance program that jeopardize its long-term stability. 
This proposal would result in targeting FHA, in part, to households well above median income, the vast majority of whom are already homeowners. An increase in the maximum mortgage amount would do little to help the households that FHA is intended to serve, namely moderate income families who for one reason or another do not have access to the conventional mortgage market. 
Mr. President, Senator Nickles, I think, did a good job of arguing his position, and the points that Senator Sarbanes raised is one of the central areas of debate. 
I would like to focus my attention on some other aspects of FHA. I want to focus the bulk of my comments now on a series of management problems in FHA which should be corrected before FHA expands its program and assumes further risks. 
At a Housing Subcommittee hearing in May, we heard testimony concerning serious material weaknesses in internal controls, financial systems and resource management that make the Department vulnerable to waste, fraud and mismanagement. Although HUD is in the process of a major management reform program, the ultimate success of that effort is questionable. 
FHA, with about $400 billion of insurance-in-force and a portfolio of 6.7 million single-family loans, is HUD's largest, most visible--and most vulnerable--program area. Many of the material weaknesses identified and described by the HUD Inspector General, the General Accounting Office and others, involve FHA programs. Further, these problems have been identified in each independent audit of FHA conducted since fiscal year 1991. 
First, FHA's staffing resources have significantly declined over the past several years. Furthermore, the majority of staffing reductions that have already occurred or are planned under HUD's 2020 Management Reform come out of FHA's single-family operations. FHA's staffing resources have declined during a period where its insured portfolio has continued to increase. In 1992, FHA's staff was about 6,800, but today, its staff is down to around 4,100. This is equivalent to a 40 percent reduction. This raises concerns about the quality of skilled staff that remain at FHA today, since many senior staff have left the Department. Replacing this staff is problematic, since unlike private entities, FHA does not have the authority to hire staff or the ability to quickly invest more resources in automated tools or staff training when its business increase. 
Second, FHA has serious weaknesses with its accounting and financial management systems. The main problems with its information system is that the systems are not linked and integrated or configured to meet all financial reporting requirements. Also, data quality problems exist in its default monitoring system. Although these problems have been recognized for several years. The HUD Inspector General has found that `resources needed to develop state-of-the-art systems are lacking' because of budgetary constraints or the lack of prioritizing these matters. 
FHA's accounting and financial management systems will also be affected by the so-called `Year 2000' or `Y2K' problem. FHA has 19 critical systems that OMB has mandated to be Y2K compliant by March 1999. However, only two systems have been programmed to address Y2K, and neither has been certified as Y2K compliant. The GAO recently warned that failure to address the Y2K problem could result in system failures that would interrupt the processing of applications for mortgage insurance and the payment of mortgage insurance claims. 
Third, data integrity problems with its default monitoring system has affected FHA's ability to effectively monitor the performance of its mortgagees. FHA also lacks an effective underwriting system that can predict which borrowers pose the greatest risk. Identifying and managing risk is absolutely critical to the long-term soundness of FHA. 
While FHA's single-family insurance fund currently exceeds its capital reserve requirement, there have been recent indications of 
potential problems in the FHA program. If these problems are not corrected, then FHA faces financial instability. For example, FHA defaults are serveral times higher than either the VA or the conventional mortgage market. During fiscal year 1997 claim payments for FHA-insured loans, especially for adjustable rate mortgages, were far higher than expected. The inventory of single-family properties owned by HUD increased by about 30 percent to more than 30,000. We have also heard and seen evidence that the geographic concentration of mortgage defaults, and FHA's inability to manage and monitor its portfolio, have damaged neighborhoods and permitted families to purchase homes that are either substandard or unafforable. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recently introduced lower down payment mortgage products that may attract some of FHA's lower-risk borrowers, leaving FHA with more of the high-risk market. 
There is no denying that the FHA single-family insurance program has been a success. More than 24 million households have used FHA since its creation in 1934. FHA has traditionally been a preferred tool for homeownership by young families and first-time homebuyers and by lower income and minority households who for many reasons have not been served well by the conventional marketplace. And, thanks to reforms begun under Secretary Jack Kemp, FHA has made significant strides toward financial stability. I have a strong interest in ensuring that FHA take all of the necessary steps to ensure that it continues to serve the people and communities the program is intended to serve and will ultimately make the program more financially stable. 
However,I question whether it is prudent for any business, let alone one ultimately subsidized by the taxpayer, to expand its operations while attempting to deal with serious management problems. And on the basis of this concern alone, an increase in FHA loan limits would not be prudent. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. BOXER, Mr. President, I take the floor to stand in opposition to the amendment that would strike the raise in the ceiling on the Federal Housing Administration loan limit. I believe the raise in the ceiling is critical for high cost real estate market areas, and I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. 
This bill raises the ceiling on FHA loans from 75 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, which is about $170,000, to 87 percent of the conforming loan limit, or about $197,000. This is particularly good for my state, where the cost of housing is so high, especially in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
FHA loans encourages lenders to make mortgage credit available in areas and to borrowers who may not otherwise qualify for conventional loans on affordable terms, such as first-time home buyers. Raising the loan limit will help those who have not been able to get conventional loans because of small credit blemishes or a lack of a large cash downpayment. These are the gaps in homeownership that FHA now fills, across income levels, and home prices. 
This is a modest proposal, and one that helps consumers residing in high-cost areas of the country who are currently locked out of housing because the FHA maximum of $170,362 is less than the average cost of housing. 
The cost of housing is so high in the Bay Area, that Bridge Housing Corporation rarely uses FHA. Carol Galante, the president of Bridge, one of the largest non-profit housing developers in the country, says she rarely can use FHA insurance because the loan limits are so far below the median home price for Northern California. 
Raising the FHA loan limit will enable FHA to reach more borrowers and more communities which are not currently being served by the private mortgage industry. The raise in the FHA loan limit as provided for in this bill will help between 125,000 and 175,000 worthy American families, including 16,500 to 23,100 California families, to have access to homeownership over the next 5 years. 
In the 15 highest cost U.S. housing markets, the homeownership rate is only 58%. That is more than 7 percentage points below the national average, and in these markets, FHA is the only credit program not available to moderate-income households. Thus, in places like New York, Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, over 7% of families are systematically denied access to homeownership. This increase in the loan limit will allow 18 counties in California to raise their loan limits. 
The increase in the loan limit will generate revenues of about $80 million a year. FHA has never called upon the taxpayers for a bailout, and certainly will not under this proposal.

Mr. MACK. Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage in a colloquy with you concerning a very important project in the State of Florida, known as the Sweetwater Branch/Payne's Prairie Stormwater Protection Initiative.

Mr. Mack. I thank the chairman. Through the Sweetwater Branch/Payne's Prairie Stormwater Protection Initiative, the City of Gainsville, Florida is attempting to tackle a very critical and complex problem that confronts not only Gainesville, but ultimately the drinking water supply of much of Central Florida. 
The Sweetwater Basin, which emanates above and beyond Gainesville, runs through some of the oldest sections of the City. The Sweetwater Basin discharges into a very critical natural resource in Florida, known as Payne's Prairie, a natural reserve park owned by the State of Florida. It is home to a number of plants and animal species that are unique to Florida. As these discharges move further through the system, they discharge into what is called the Alachua Sink, a major natural sink hole that drains directly into the Florida Aquifer. 
The City has taken the initiative to bring together the State, the County and a broad array of environmental resources and interests in order to tackle the problems that result from contaminated runoffs which seriously impact the health of Payne's Prairie and ultimately the Florida Aquifer. The City is trying to address the problem now, in order to prevent a more serious deterioration. Unfortunately, this is a problem and a project that is beyond the scope and reach of this one small city.

Mr. MACK. Yes, it has. The City has brought together and obtained the support of Alachua County, the St. Johns Water Management District, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for the purpose of providing a solution to this problem. The City of Gainesville is to be commended for bringing together so many various interests and impact parties to address this problem. This City needs help. They have devised a preliminary plan with a relatively low cost which could ameliorate and potentially resolve the situation, but because the project is beyond the scope of the City's jurisdiction, it seems to fall between the cracks of any one federal program at this time.

Mr. MACK. The Chairman is correct. The City of Gainesville has a long history of taking care of its own problems with local resources. In this case the City has already committed resources to the development of this plan and remain commits to a financial partnership. 
I am pleased, Mr. Chairman, that you agree with me on the importance of this project and are willing to work with Senator Graham and the City of Gainesville to explore a more specific source of funding for this project in the up coming Conference with the other body. It is my understanding that this is correct?

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Defense Jobs and Trade Promotion Act of 1998. This bill will eliminate a provision of tax law which discriminates against United States exporters of defense products. 
Other nations have systems of taxation which rely less on corporate income taxes and more on value-added taxes. By rebating the value-added taxes for products that are exported, these nations lower the costs of their exports and provide their companies a competitive advantage that is not based on quality, ingenuity, or resources but rather on tax policy. 
In an attempt to level the playing field, our tax code allows U.S. companies to establish Foreign Sales Corporations (FSCs) through which U.S.-manufactured products may be exported. A portion of the profits from FSC sales are exempted from corporate income taxes, to mitigate the advantage that other countries give their exporters through value-added tax rebates. 
But the tax benefits of a FSC are cut in half for defense exporters. This 50% limitation is the result of a compromise enacted 22 years ago as part of the predecessor to the FSC provisions. This compromise was not based on policy considerations, but instead merely split the difference between members who believed that the U.S. defense industry was so dominant in world markets that the foreign tax advantages were inconsequential, and members who believed that all U.S. exporters should be treated equally. 
Today, U.S. defense manufacturers face intense competition from foreign businesses. With the sharp decline in the defense budget over the past decade, exports of defense products play a prominent role in maintaining a viable U.S. defense industrial base. It makes no sense to allow differences in international tax systems to stand as an obstacle to exports of U.S. defense products. We must level the international playing field for U.S. defense product manufacturers. 
The fifty percent exclusion for sales of defense products makes even less sense when one considers that the sale of every defense product to a foreign government requires the determination of both the President and the Congress that the sale will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace. This is more than a matter of fair treatment for all U.S. exporters. National security is enhanced when our allies use U.S.-manufactured military equipment, because of its compatibility with equipment used by our armed forces. 
The bill I am introducing today will repeal the provision of the Foreign Sales Corporation laws that discriminates against U.S. defense product manufacturers, enhancing both the competitiveness of U.S. companies in world markets and our national security.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks on the extraordinary efforts which are currently taking place in my home state of Florida. For over a month now, as I am sure we are all well aware, devastating wildfires have ravaged Florida, impacting all of our 67 counties. Since this crisis began, more than 2,000 separate fires to date have been identified and more than 500,000 acres of state and federal land have been burned. 
While these facts are certainly overwhelming, I think it is important that we take a moment to recognize the heroic campaign which has been undertaken to contain these fires. Last week I had the opportunity to tour the fire ravaged area of Volusia County, and I met with firefighters and emergency officials on the front line of what has been a constant battle. I was simply overwhelmed by the determination of these men and women who have undertaken the challenge of extinguishing these fires. These brave individuals are working 16 to 18 hours a day in extreme temperatures and the harshest of conditions. Tragically, these fires have consumed over 367 homes and 33 businesses. It is, however, thanks to the efforts of these individuals that losses have remained at this level. 
These dedicated professionals, who have put their lives on the line fighting the wildfires, represent the tremendous support which Florida has received by our fellow Americans. Not since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 have we seen an outpouring of human kindness and supplies from around the country to help Florida fight a natural disaster of this magnitude. It is disasters like this which bring the American people together and makes our country one giant community. To date, 44 states, from as far away as California and Alaska, are involved in this effort. Through an outstanding coordinated effort on the part of local, state and federal agencies, countless numbers of people are working behind the scenes, including the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and private citizens. 
I have remained in close contact with state and federal emergency officials, and I am confident all that can be done is being done. What Florida really needs is rain. While the situation still remains quite volatile, the weather patterns do offer some hope and relief to the devastated areas. Over the past few days several rainstorms have offered some relief, however much more is still needed to completely extinguish the fires. I know all of my colleagues join me in letting the firefighters, emergency officials and residents battling these fires know they are in our thoughts and prayers as they continue the fight to extinguish these fires.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to make some brief comments to commend the work of Senator Specter with regard to the inclusion of language in the bill to improve public safety on college and university campuses. I am an original cosponsor of the legislation Senator Specter introduced on May 20, 1998, the Campus Crime Disclosure Act. 
My involvement in this important legislation began earlier this year, when I met with the Clery family of Palm City, Florida. Their personal tragedy, whereby Howard and Connie Clery's daughter Jeanne was brutally murdered in her college dormitory in 1998 at Lehigh University, saddened me. Since her death, her family has kept her memory alive by working to provide parents and students with more and better information about crimes occurring on college campuses. The result is the important changes to federal law which we are considering here today. 
These changes include a modification to the Department of Education's definition of a `college campus'. This definition will now include sidewalks and other areas adjacent to schools but not owned by the school. The Department had previously interpreted the term `campus' to exclude these areas. I, like Senator Specter, believe this is an incorrect interpretation. The result was that schools were not reporting crimes that had taken place on a sidewalk used by students to get to class. This legislation will correct that problem. 
Furthermore, the legislation sets up a stronger but flexible enforcement mechanism which provides that the Department can fine schools that are not complying with federal reporting laws dealing with campus security. Congress has given the Secretary of Education enforcement discretion when a school is found to be in non-compliance after a public hearing is conducted. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that we are taking these important steps to ensure safer campuses for college students. I appreciate the fine work of the Chairman, Mr. Jeffords, in including these important provisions. I commend the work of the Clery's in increasing the public's awareness about campus crime, although I realize that this day must be bitter-sweet. I look forward to continuing to work with them in the future.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there is much discussion in the news about the slow progress of the Middle East Peace Process. Unfortunately, much of the criticism is pointed at Israel's Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu. I was pleased to read, however, the Jerusalem Post's editorial of July 6 titled `The Missing Summit' which correctly identifies Arafat's failure to revise the PLO Covenant as a major obstacle to peace. The editorial reads as follows:  
The summer heat tends to slow everything down, even diplomacy. In the absence of real movement in the peace process, talk of summits is proliferating. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has unsuccessfully pushed for a `Madrid 2' international conference, France and Egypt have a proposal, and yesterday Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein, and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat met in Cairo. However, the only summit missing is the one that is most necessary--between Netanyahu and Arafat. 
When Mubarak, Hussein, and Arafat last met in September, they could hardly have expected that by now there would still be no deal on the much-anticipated second redeployment. Much of the blame for delay has fallen on Netanyahu's doorstep, and indeed Netanyahu seems to be a master at drawing matters out. Next to Arafat, however, Netanyahu's delaying skills seem almost amateur. 
In the current stalemate, one of the main issues in contention is Israel's demand that the Palestinians amend the PLO Covenant to erase its multiple calls for Israel's destruction. Arafat's promise to do so is as old as the Oslo process itself. The Oslo era officially began with an exchange of letters between prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Arafat, days before the signing of the Declaration of Principles on the White House lawn. Arafat's September 9, 1993 letter to Rabin states the Covenant's denials of Israel's right to exist `are now inoperative' and that he pledges to `submit to the Palestinian National Council for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the Palestinian Covenant.' 
At that time, amending the Covenant seemed imminent. It is now almost six years later, and Arafat's commitment is yet to be implemented. In April 1996, the Peres government attempted to negotiate a formula to resolve the issue, but the resolution actually passed by the PNC again made no specific amendment to the Covenant. Then in January 1997, as part of the Hebron Accords, Arafat again committed to `complete the process' of amending the Covenant. 
Since then, Arafat has sent letters to President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair retroactively listing the articles of the Covenant that were supposedly canceled by the 1996 PNC resolution. But this, too, can only be taken as a statement of intentions, since the Covenant states that it can only be amended by a two-thirds vote of the PNC, and numerous PLO officials have stated that it has been `frozen,' not amended. Now Netanyahu is seen to be delaying matters by demanding that the Palestinians finally carry out a commitment that is a foundation stone of the entire process. 
Since the beginning of the Oslo process, Israel has--despite fits and starts, internal division, and even the assassination of the prime minister--demonstrated its commitment to the process by transferring territorial control to the Palestinians. Even under Netanyahu, this process continued with the redeployment in Hebron, and now a major further redeployment is on the table. In this context, it is not unreasonable to characterize the situation as Netanyahu did to the diplomatic corps on Friday: `The issue is not what Israel is prepared to give--it is prepared to give considerably--but it is the Palestinians' unwillingness to give anything of substance.' 
In the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Police cut off Israeli settlements after the IDF refused passage on an Israeli security road to a convoy led by a Palestinian minister. The standoff, which could have broken out into a full-fledged shooting war, was a reminder of how dangerous the current situation is. But the lesson is not just that Israel has an interest in resolving the existing impasse, but that the Palestinians do as well. 
Now that Clinton has returned from China and the end of the Knesset summer session approaches, the fate of the redeployment package will be determined. So far, the United States has not rejected Israel's concerns regarding the package on the table, but it has not subjected the Palestinians to the same public pressure that Israel has been under. The sticking point is no longer the size of the redeployment, since creative solutions can be found for the territory surrounding the Israeli settlements that will be isolated by the withdrawal. The more significant question is whether Arafat will be pressed to deliver something much less tangible than what Israel is delivering, but no less necessary for the ultimate success of the peace process. Amending the Covenant is such a fundamental building block, as is an end to the long boycott by Arafat of direct negotiations with Netanyahu. 
Mr. President, the Palestinian Authority has promised since 1993 to change the PLO Covenant so that the Israeli people can be confident in the Palestinian regime's acceptance of the existence of the State of Israel. To this day, this most basic and vital action has not been done. As the Jerusalem Post correctly points out, the U.S. Government has `. . . not subjected the Palestinians to the same public pressure that Israel has been under.' 
The Palestinian Authority must formally and officially amend the Covenant. Until they do so, United States influence should be focused on this failed Palestinian promise.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, first I commend Finance Committee Chairman Roth, and my Finance Committee colleagues Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Grassley, for their invaluable contributions to this important step in cleaning up the IRS. The IRS reform bill that we are about to pass would never have seen the light of day were it not for the efforts of the IRS restructuring commission and the determined leadership of Chairman Roth, who presided over the first meaningful IRS oversight hearings that this body has had in decades. 
The IRS reform bill is a landmark achievement, a shot across the bow to the IRS letting them know that `business as usual' will no longer be tolerated. But this bill--although it contains the largest assortment of taxpayer rights ever enacted into law, and reforms the IRS with such important innovations as the new Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration--is only the first step in a continuing process to curb the abuses of the IRS. More important than the new taxpayer rights, more important than the procedural and structural reforms, is the process that we used to fashion this bill. Simply stated, the oversight power of the Congress is the single most powerful tool that we have to root out the abuses and injustices that have become ingrained in the corrupted culture of the IRS. I strongly support the concept of regular oversight hearings of the full Finance Committee to make sure that past mistakes are corrected, that past misconduct is punished, and that the attitude and modus operandi at the IRS are changed permanently. 
The corrupt culture of the IRS can change only if the old regime at the IRS is completely swept away. I am encouraged by the recent announcement of a high-level resignation at the Service, in an office which seemed to be a black hole for disciplinary investigations completed against IRS officials. But one change in office is not enough. Our oversight hearings exposed a rogue agency that was literally out of control. We heard testimony that armed agents use SWAT-team tactics to raid businesses, that IRS officials callously ignored the life-threatening health problems of a taxpayer, that a sexual harasser was promoted to be national director of Equal Employment Opportunity, and that statistics of property seizures were used to evaluate the performance of IRS employees. 
Most incredible but all-too-believable was the story of one of my constituents, an IRS employee who blew the whistle on a renegade special agent with a drinking and substance abuse problem. This renegade agent had fabricated allegations of political corruption against several public officials, including the former Majority Leader of this body. This renegade was protected instead of punished by his supervisors, and the IRS employees with the courage and public spirit to report the misconduct ended up being the targets of retaliation. In this instance, as in most of the horror stories brought before the Finance Committee, the misconduct could not have occurred without the encouragement or acquiescence of IRS management. Yet, we were told that one of the IRS managers responsible for this cover-up and retaliation was still on the job. 
Congress cannot let up on the IRS. We must follow through on the misconduct exposed by the bright spotlight of our oversight hearings. I am calling on Commissioner Rossotti to testify again before the Finance Committee, prior to the end of this legislative session, to bring us up to date on the disciplinary actions taken as a result of our hearings. Has the member of IRS management who covered up the scheme to frame Senator Howard Baker been fired? Have the IRS employees responsible for the abuses of power recounted to the Finance Committee been identified and terminated? Have the members of IRS management who condoned such behavior, or who ignored it through complete incompetence, been found and disciplined? We cannot fall 
into the trap of thinking that things are fixed at the IRS just because this reform bill will soon become law. The Senate has an obligation to continue its vigilance over the actions of the IRS, to follow through on the abuses that have been exposed and root out those that perpetuate. Experience has shown conclusively that the IRS cannot be trusted to police itself. 
This IRS reform bill is a step in the right direction. The comprehensive taxpayer bill of rights section is of the most value to taxpayers, although it is my belief that these provisions could have gone further to strengthen the rights of our taxpayers. Unfortunately, under our rules, overly aggressive and abusive IRS collections activity is apparently built into the budget baseline, and can only be redressed by raising new taxes as an offset. Any system that requires us to raise taxes to replace money that the IRS picks from the pockets of our taxpayers is a system that is broken and needs fixing. 
I am particularly pleased that the provisions of my Taxpayer Confidentiality Act are included in the conference report. These provisions afford uniform confidentiality protection to taxpayers for the tax advice they receive from federally authorized tax practitioners in noncriminal matters before the IRS and during subsequent court proceedings. Under current law, communications between taxpayers and lawyers concerning tax advice can often be protected from disclosure to the IRS by the common law attorney-client privilege, but communications with other federally-authorized tax practitioners--certified public accountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, and attorneys providing advice in the role of a tax practitioner--are not protected. The new tax practitioner-client privilege eliminates this unfair penalty imposed on taxpayers based on their choice of tax advisor. 
I am concerned, though, about an amendment to this provision that was inserted at the 11th hour while the bill was in conference. The amendment was meant to target written promotional and solicitation materials used by the peddlers of corporate tax shelters, but appears to me to be vague and unfortunately employs an ambiguous definition of tax shelter that some argue could be read to include all tax planning. 
I discussed the problems inherent in this last-minute attempt to create an exception for the marketing of corporate tax shelters in meetings and discussions with the Majority Leader, Chairman Roth, their counterparts in the House, and the Speaker. It was agreed that the language would be clarified to alleviate these concerns and ensure that the amendment does not cover routine tax advice and normal tax planning designed to minimize a corporation's federal tax liability. The language of the conference report, however, could be interpreted in a manner which does not fully reflect our understanding and thus undermines the intended benefit to taxpayers. 
Our oversight hearings have given us ample reason not to trust the IRS to interpret this exception to the new privilege in a narrow manner. Nor can taxpayers rely on timely clarification through judicial interpretations, as these will be many years in the making. This is an item we will have to address at the soonest possible instance, in the next tax bill. 
One excuse we often hear from apologists for the IRS is that our tax laws are too complicated, and that this is the source of the tensions between taxpayers and the Service. I cannot accept this as the reason why armed raids are conducted on the homes and businesses of peaceful citizens, or why laws and internal IRS rules are broken with gusto and impunity. But it is true that the complexity of the code is a drain on the resources of our taxpayers, and is one of the reasons I support tax reform. In this regard, it is a big relief to all taxpayers, big and small, young and old, that the provisions of my Capital Gains Simplification Act have been incorporated in the IRS reform bill. Restoring the 12-month holding period for long-term capital gains will dramatically reduce tax compliance costs, lessen the punitive lock-in effect on capital, and yield additional federal revenues in the first 2 years. 
There is one final point I would like to make concerning the IRS reform bill, as one of the primary advocates of the Sense of the Senate Resolution and the moratorium on Notice 98-11 regulations. Notice 98-35, issued by Treasury to announce its intention to withdraw the proposed and temporary regulations issued under Notice 98-11, has raised some concern for high-tech industries. For instance, Notice 98-35 does not make clear the grandfather rules for licenses--it is important that this be clarified, as the income of many high tech businesses comes from royalties tied to licensing agreements. Also, the asset test described in Notice 98-35 may put high tech businesses at a disadvantage--as the assets of high tech business consists mainly of intangible assets, which the Notice does not adequately take into account. It is my hope that the Treasury Department will clarify these and other issues unique to high tech businesses. 
Mr. President, final passage of the IRS reform bill is an important step in the on-going process of reining in the IRS. Let no defender of the status quo at the Service be mistaken on this point: This is the beginning, not the end, of our reform efforts.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in the last two appropriations acts, the Congress provided enhanced section 8 tenant-based subsidies to low-income residents of certain multifamily housing properties whose owners have elected to prepay their FHA-insured mortgages. These enhanced vouchers were provided to protect residents from displacement from their homes. I understand, however, that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has interpreted the appropriations language so that previously assisted residents would pay an amount based on the same amount of rent on the date of prepayment regardless of a change in their adjusted income. In other words, HUD would require previously assisted residents to no longer base their rent contribution as a percentage of income. This policy interpretation will likely force a section 8 assisted resident to pay a higher percentage of their income in rent if their income decreased and potentially result in displacement. 
Mr. President, HUD's interpretation seems contrary to the intent of the appropriations language and the statutory requirements under section 8 or other rental assistance programs. I would like to ask the Chairman of the VA, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee if HUD has correctly interpreted the intent of the appropriations language.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the `mark-to-market' program that was enacted last year in the VA/HUD appropriations act was expected to be implemented by late October of this year. While I applaud the efforts of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in preparing the implementation of the law, I am still concerned about its progress and ability to meet the October deadline. 
I am concerned about the President's failure after 9 months to nominate a Director of the Office of Multifamily Housing Assisted Restructuring and that interim regulations have not yet been published. I, however, would like to focus on the fact that HUD has not begun the process for selecting participating administrative entities (PAE). Without them, the program will not work. In the original mark-to-market legislation that passed the Senate as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, State and local housing finance agencies (HFA) that had qualified under the mark-to-market demonstration and FHA risk-sharing programs would automatically qualify as PAEs. The Banking Committee felt strongly that HFAs not only were the best entities to administer mark-to-market, but it also had concerns about HUD's ability to select qualified entities in a timely and objective manner.

Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee for his response and shared concerns. I would like to stress that the credibility of HUD is directly linked to its successful implementation of the mark-to-market program. It is 
imperative that the Department not only ensures that the program is implemented in time and in compliance with the letter and spirit of the law, but it also ensures a smooth transition. I believe that the legislation provides the Secretary with sufficient flexibility in selecting PAEs and would highly recommend that the Secretary use its current restructuring agents to continue as PAEs under the permanent program, especially if the program is to be implemented in time. As I have advocated before, I would specifically recommend the use of State and local HFAs as PAEs. 
HFAs have proven that they have the capacity and willingness to serve as the federal government's partners in affordable housing. Thirty HFAs have been qualified by HUD to participate under the mark-to-market demonstration program. Twenty-eight HFAs are participating in the FHA risk-sharing program. Almost every state HFA has administered the successful Low Income Housing Tax Credit program since the Congress created it in 1986. HFAs have financed more than 200,000 Section 8 units and administer Section 8 contracts on behalf of HUD in many cases. Thirty-four HFAs administer the HOME program, under which multifamily properties are being financed every year. 
It is clear from this evidence that the HFAs are the most qualified to act as PAEs under the mark-to-market program and more importantly, they are publicly accountable and have missions that are aligned with HUD. I expect HUD to approve many HFAs as PAEs and provide them as much flexibility as possible within appropriate parameters to administer the program.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today with my colleague, Senator Graham. I introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 1998. It was a little over a year ago that we introduced similar legislation to protect the pristine environment off of Florida's coasts. That legislation would have banned leasing within 100 miles of the coast of Florida, and would have canceled six oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf closest to Florida's coast held by the Mobil Corporation. Fortunately, soon after we introduced our bill, Mobil decided to pull out of those leases. Nevertheless, the threat to Florida's coastline remains. 
Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our state. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy because, in Florida. A healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to our State each year to enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The tourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates revenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford to let that happen. 
Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal the entire Florida Congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from our coasts. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. 
Mr. President, while the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well-documented, the reality remains that leases have been let, potential drilling sites have been explored and it is likely that actual extraction of resources could take place within the next few years. For these reasons, I rise with Senator Graham to protect our state from the ravages of drilling. 
First, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing activity within 100 miles of our coast in order to prevent a repeat of the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida. Second, it requires additional studies be conducted prior to the issuance of permits of oil and gas production on existing leases. Finally, it gives the state flexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil and gas development and production plans with The Coastal Zone Management Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the direct and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the Minerals Management Service. 
Mr. President, removing the threat of oil and gas exploration permanently from our shores will require responsible leadership from the Congress. This legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary to protect our state's economic and environmental well-being. I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile effort. We look forward to working with Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, to meet this goal.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the pending amendment. 
I deeply regret the circumstances regarding India's decision to detonate nuclear devices. But the increased instability in South Asia has been caused by China's proliferation policies, a U.S. foreign policy which favors China over India, and the licensing of technologies by the United States which enhances China's military capabilities. 
So I wonder why we would consider strongly condemning the Indian government--the democratically elected Indian government--for taking legal actions in its perceived self interest. And I further question this amendment occurring on a day in which the Senate could not vote to express our concerns with the reprehensible actions taken by the communist party officials running the People's Republic of China. 
Mr. President, India has broken no international laws or agreements by choosing to test nuclear devices, and India is not a known proliferator of weapons or weapons technology. We know, however, that China is a proliferator. Of particular concern is Chinese proliferation of weapons and technologies to Pakistan. But today the Senate will vote to condemn India and fail to vote to condemn China. 
India and China went to war in 1962. To this day, China continues to occupy 15,000 square miles of Indian territory in Ladakh and it claims sovereignty over the entire 35,000 square miles of India's Northeastern most province. The pending amendment rightly points out that India has not joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. But the amendment fails to recognize that the NPT seeks to ensure the current five nuclear powers alone are able to possess nuclear weapons. This means that China can maintain its arsenal, but India cannot. India has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for similar reasons. 
Mr. President, there appears to be a serious contradiction represented in our foreign policy which makes no sense to me. It is for this reason that I cannot support this amendment and will vote against it. I yield the floor.  
Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I commend Senator Torricelli for his comments on this bill and for his efforts, as well, throughout this entire process. I say to my friend, Senator Coverdell, again, that this would not have happened if it hadn't been for his commitment to this idea, his persistence, and his willingness to, in essence, say it will never end until we pass it. So I commend him for the effort he has made all throughout these months. 
This bill will enable working families to keep more of what they earn, and it includes a number of other important education provisions. 
My focus during this debate has been on providing every classroom in America with a competent, caring, and qualified teacher. In my opinion, teachers make all the difference in the learning process. 
America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable, and hard-working teachers. Nevertheless, in classrooms all over America, teachers are being assigned to teach classes for which they have no formal training. 
Consider these statistics: Twenty percent of English classes were taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in English literature, communications, speech, journalism, English education, or reading education. That is one out of five. Twenty-five percent of mathematics classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in mathematics or mathematics education. That is one out of four. Thirty-nine percent of life sciences or biology classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in biology or life science. Fifty-six percent of physical science classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in physics, chemistry, geology, or earth sciences. More than 50 percent of history or world civilization classes were taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in history. Students in schools with the highest minority enrollments have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and a degree in the field that he or she teaches. 
The amendment I introduced, along with Senator D'Amato, provides incentives for States to test their teachers on the subject matter they teach and to pay their teachers based on merit and proven performance. In light of the statistics I mentioned before, it is clear that teacher testing is necessary and important. 
Our amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 63-35, and I am pleased that it is included in this conference report. The Congress should be proud of this bill and the efforts we have made to promote responsible education policy. I hope this bill will receive broad bipartisan support. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his hard work and dedication on this bill. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with the handling of United States foreign policy on the eve of President Clinton's second summit with the People's Republic of China. American foreign policy should promote freedom, democracy, respect for human dignity, and the rule of law. It is hard for me to imagine that the President would reward inappropriate actions by the Chinese Communist Party leaders while simultaneously sanctioning the democratic leaders in India. 
Over India's 50-year history, U.S. relations have been hot and cold. But we cannot deny the reality that today, India is the largest democracy in the world. India recently held the largest democratic elections in the history of the world. And democracy is more than just a word. We have a common bond with the Indian people based upon a commitment to democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. They are a people who have struggled for freedom from a colonial power in order to gain independence. We share that struggle in our histories. 
India has many friends in the United States, and many Americans proudly claim Indian heritage. But our relationship with India has been neglected, and unfortunately, we find ourselves in a difficult bind. Due to India's recent decision to detonate nuclear devices on May 11 and May 13, we have instituted sanctions. I deeply regret the circumstances regarding India's decision to detonate nuclear devices. But the increased instability has been caused by China's proliferation policies, a U.S. foreign policy which favors China over India, and the licensing of technologies by the United States which enhances China's military capabilities. 
Let me review some of the facts. 
India has broken no international laws or agreements by choosing to test nuclear devices. 
India is not a known proliferator of weapons or weapons technology. 
India's 50-year history demonstrates peaceful intent exercised within a democratic society. 
India has been a nuclear power since it conducted its first nuclear tests in 1974; this status did not change with last month's tests. 
Although not at war, India's borders are considered `hot spots' for several reasons. 
Since independence in 1947, India and Pakistan have been disputing borders. 
Also since independence, India has understood the importance of good relations with China for its own security. 
Relations were clouded by China's occupation in 1950 of Tibet, which had been independent until then and served as a stable buffer between the two countries. This occupation brought Chinese expansion to India's border. 
India sought renewed cooperative relations on the basis of a policy that recognized Tibet's genuine autonomy under Chinese sovereignty in order to maintain a buffer between India and China. 
Relations completely changed, however, following China's military build-up in Tibet beginning in 1956 and 1957. During this period, China began the systematic oppression of Tibetan religion and culture, forcing the mass migration of Tibetans. The Dalai Lama and thousands of Tibetans were given refuge in India in 1959. After forty years, the Tibetan oppression continues, the military occupation of Tibet continues, and nearly 200,000 Tibetans remain in India. 
Between 1957 and 1962, India's relations with China were marred by Beijing's huge territorial claims amounting to 50,000 square miles, and its illegal use of force to occupy 15,000 square miles of that claimed area. 
Indian attempts to reach a border settlement through negotiations with China failed in 1961, and its attempts to prevent further Chinese encroachment into Indian territory was met by a massive Chinese invasion in 1962. 
To this day, China continues to occupy 15,000 square miles of Indian territory in Ladakh and it claims sovereignty over the entire 35,000 square miles of India's Northeastern most province [Arunachal Pradesh]. This source of tension and deep concern has not been removed despite several rounds of Sino-Indian diplomatic negotiations to resolve the border dispute since 1981. 
China conducted its first nuclear test in October 1964, within 2 years of the outbreak of the Sino-Indian War. In 1966, China tested its first medium range ballistic missile, and tested again in 1970. 
India decided to develop its nuclear weapons program in 1970. It conducted its first tests, declaring its capability to the world, in 1974. 
India did not join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty--known as the `NPT'--in 1968 because the treaty sought to ensure an arms control system that would allow the five powers alone--China, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and the United States--to possess nuclear weapons. That meant that China, the internally oppressive and undemocratic occupying force on India's border, would be permitted to have nuclear weapons while India, fearful and insecure, would be denied any recourse to such weapons. 
India has not signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty because the treaty seeks to prevent India from conducting further tests without limiting China's ability to do the same. Like the NPT, India refuses to join this treaty as a nonnuclear power unless China and the other powers agree to disarm. 
Between 1974 and 1998, India experienced sanctions by the United States on nuclear energy, space, computer, and other technologies. 
Following India's first nuclear tests in 1974, it did not conduct further tests, until now. 
India has not been a proliferator of nuclear weapons and missiles but China, a nuclear power, has proliferated. 
Some estimates indicate 90 percent of China's weapons sales go to states which border India. Of particular concern is Chinese proliferation of such weapons and technologies to Pakistan. 
Between 1974 and 1998, India has tried to break through the difficulties with China and Pakistan. India had not conducted any further tests, even though China had. India had not illegally proliferated weapons--China had. But India has been denied the same nuclear and technical cooperation which we have accorded to the PRC. 
India's commercial electricity needs are among the largest in the world, similar to China's. We have recently signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the PRC, but maintain restrictions on nuclear power agreements with India. 
India's testing in 1974 and in 1998, again, violated no agreements. North Korea expelled international inspectors in 1993, in direct violation of the NPT. We `rewarded' the brutal dictatorship in North Korea with a classic appeasement plan--free fuel oil and $4 billion worth of the top of the line nuclear reactors in exchange for their promises to do what they didn't do under an internationally binding agreement. 
China may be too preoccupied today to directly threaten India, but they need only employ Pakistan as a surrogate belligerent to jeopardize India's security. 
Mr. President, the United States is helping the largest single-party authoritarian government in the world suppress the development of the largest democracy in the world. I submit that China's behavior against students on Tiananmen Square, resistance to freedom and democratic reforms, abysmal human rights record, and dangerous and irresponsible proliferation activities deserve America's scorn more than India's legal actions taken in defense of its own national interests. There is something inherently wrong with sanctioning a democracy legally acting in its perceived national interests while rewarding a single party communist state which threatens regional security in violation of international law. 
India watched carefully as the United States has led the world in a policy of engagement with China. From the U.S.-China relationship, India has learned some important lessons. First, look at the rationale the U.S. gives for its policy toward China. We must `engage' with China because it is the most populous country, an enormous potential market, a major trading nation, a member of the permanent five at the United Nations Security Council, and China is a nuclear power with a modernizing military. With these qualifications China has been able to get top priority and attention from U.S. Government and business leaders. In spite of posing a potential threat to the United States and being among the world's worst human rights violators, China gets the perks of enormously favorable trade and investment flows and top level diplomatic treatment, including presidential visits, while India gets sanctioned. This makes no sense--it is strange--and it's just wrong. 
The United States largely overlooks India despite its 950 million people, its democratic government, and the largest middle class in the world. Demographers predict that India's population will surpass that of China sometime during the next century. Thus, the only attribute India lacks when compared with its sometimes-aggressive neighbor, in this administration's definition of importance, is acceptance into the `nuclear club.' The message sent by the Clinton foreign policy team has encouraged India to conclude the most effective way to ensure its interests are protected from an increasingly powerful Asian superpower, and garner greater diplomatic and commercial attention from the West, is to remind the world of its nuclear deterrent capability. 
What lessons are we to learn? First, the United States should be more cautious with our definition of `engagement.' By overlooking China's proliferation activities--not imposing sanctions when required by law--we are rewarding the wrong behavior. Second, understanding that India considered its security environment to be precarious enough to risk global condemnation and economic sanctions, the U.S. should take a closer look to assess whether India's fears and actions were justified. And finally, we must base our foreign policies upon the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human dignity, and the rule of law. We must look to our friends first in this endeavor, and work together to `engage' those who would oppose freedom in the world. India, along with Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and other Asian democracies should form the foundation from which our engagement in Asia begins. Working with the democracies of the world, we should engage China and bring the 1.2 billion Chinese people into the community of free nations. 
A foreign policy devoid of principle has led us to the point where we are rewarding dictators and punishing democracies. The President's visit to China this month represents another opportunity to define the United States' role in the world. The President must clearly articulate which behavior deserves praise, and which does not. He must demonstrate strong leadership on behalf of the American people. We must all understand, the behavior which the United States rewards is likely to be the behavior we will see more of in the future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will begin a period for the transaction of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill with a Gorton amendment pending regarding attorneys' fees. It is expected that a time agreement will be reached with respect to the Gorton amendment, with a vote occurring on, or in relation to, the amendment this afternoon. Following disposition of the Gorton amendment, it is hoped that further amendments will be offered and debated during today's session. Therefore, rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session as the Senate continues to make progress on the tobacco bill. 
As a final reminder to all Members, the official photo of the 105th Congress will be taken today at 2:15 p.m. in the Senate Chamber. All Senators are asked to be in the Chamber and seated at their desks immediately following the weekly party luncheons. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Grams and I introduce the Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1998. This bill would allow manufacturers of printed wiring boards and assemblies, known as the electronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production equipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law. 
As we approach the 21st Century, our Nation's Tax Code should not stand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and assemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve centers of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and televisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the Tax Code places U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage relative to their Asian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This disadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the interconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that cannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long depreciation schedule. 
As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration of competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a Tax Code that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete interconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after this equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive fire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest in new state-of-the-art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every 18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new printed wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly tripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 billion. 
But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because deductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that is several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of tax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics technology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. interconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our Tax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of American businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax laws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronics assemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble circuit boards. 
The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1998 will provide modest tax relief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 Americans, residing in every state of the Union, whose jobs rely on the success of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate tax treatment.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, as the Congress continues to address the important work of reducing government spending, eliminating layers of bureaucratic waste, and increasing efficiency, we should focus on eliminating those regulations and programs which are no longer needed and are outdated. As Republicans, we must strive to enact legislation that embraces less government, less spending and more freedom. S. 621 is a bill that embodies these important principles. 
This bill would reduce the unnecessary federal requirements included under the Public Utility Holding Act of 1935. Originally enacted to correct the abusive practices of holding companies during the 1920's and 30's, PUCHA is now an outdated law that is simply no longer needed. It has served its purpose and outlived its usefulness. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which implemented the Act has urged its repeal for several years. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, along with many state public utility commissioners, also recognize the inefficiency of PUCHA's obsolete provisions and therefore support its repeal. 
It is widely recognized that the redundant and burdensome regulations of PUCHA have resulted in higher cost for consumers. These regulations not only restrict the ability of electric producers to compete in a free market economy, but also restrict these companies from responding to the seasonal nature of electric demand. 
Many States have begun to address this issue by moving forward to a fully competitive electric market that allows consumer choice. Due to the cumbersome regulatory structure imposed upon them under the PUCHA system, States will not be able to achieve the full benefits of competition.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there are few industries I consider more vile than the cigarette manufacturers. I believe they lied to the American people and knowingly addicted millions to their harmful product. It is with this disgust and anger in mind that I encourage my colleagues to vote against the Gregg Amendment. 
Although at first blush it may seem the `right' thing to strike the liability cap if we want to punish the tobacco manufacturers, in effect we will have done exactly what they want us to do: Kill the bill. We should first ask ourselves what we are trying to accomplish with this legislation: Reduce teen smoking, fund worthy tobacco-related programs while holding harmless innocent parties such as farmers. Would the Gregg Amendment further any of those goals? No. 
The provision stricken by this amendment does not grant immunity to anyone, rather it sets a yearly cap on what they will pay and allows us to charge fees, put in place advertising restrictions and conduct strict oversight. In essence, it keeps the companies out of bankruptcy thereby allowing us to keep a close eye on them and force them to undo some of the damage they have done. The liability cap of $8 billion per year cuts off no one's rights or payments, other than for those who want to settle their claims. Taking it away would likely result in many aggrieved parties going unpaid because the companies would file for bankruptcy protection, effectively shutting out meritorious plaintiffs from recovery. 
For those of my colleagues worried about the tax burden imposed by tobacco legislation, I would think they would all vote against this amendment as well. If the Gregg Amendment is passed and the liability cap stricken, the fee would then become a pure tax and the overall tax burden on the American public would likely double. Here's why: The current bill would then not settle any state lawsuits, but rather simply impose a tax of at least $1.10. Because those state suites would continue, and likely be successful or settled, we should expect that the states will begin to impose their own taxes on tobacco. That means we see a $2-3.00 per pack increase in taxes--which is outrageous. In short, if you want to do nothing but tax and spend, vote for the Gregg Amendment. If you actually want to try and solve some of the problem of reducing teen smoking you should vote against it.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to welcome home the 351st MP Company who recently returned from Bosnia on April 3, 1998. The President sent our service men and women to Bosnia in an effort to bring peace to the region. I think it is appropriate to recognize the important and extensive contributions of our Reserve Forces without whom this extended mission probably would not have been possible. 
The 351st, consisting of 182 personnel, primarily from the City of Ocala, FL, was mobilized on August 19, 1997 and ordered to Bosnia under the command of Captain Keith Holmes. Prior to their departure, the unit underwent extensive training at both Ft. Benning, GA and Ft. Polk, LA, before being sent to Bosnia-Herzogovina. In Bosnia, the unit was split between two base camps, Eagle Base and Bedrock, located in Tuzia valley. 
While in Bosnia, the 351st participated in operation Joint Guard. The operation's major focus was to provide a stable environment for implementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP). The 351st conducted numerous peacekeeping missions, which included: area presence patrols, weapons storage site inspections, quick Reaction Force duties on Eagle Base, and protective services for numerous senior U.S. Army officers, culminating with the President of the United States during his visit to Bosnia. 
In leaving their families and their jobs, the men and women of the 351st have endured personal sacrifice and demonstrated their deep sense of duty to their country. It is only through the recognition and use of reservists as an integral part of our total force structure that the United States has been able to demonstrate its commitment to peace and security in Bosnia. And, through this commitment, the United States has made possible the promise of safety and hope of reconciliation to the people of this troubled region. 
In its role, the 351st has served as a shining example of the indispensable role of Reservists in our Armed Forces. Reservists who answered the call of duty when their country asked them to serve have my deepest respect and gratitude. Accordingly, it gives me great pleasure to welcome home the 351st MP Company and thank them for a job well done.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, President Clinton's ultimatum to Israel regarding proposals to withdrawal from the West Bank to secure the peace process is wrong and should be abandoned. What business is it of the United States to give an ultimatum to a democratically elected people regarding their own security interest? We should not publicly pressure an ally to violate their own security assessment. This is not a matter for Washington to decide, but rather for the Israeli people to decide. 
The deadline imposed on Israel by the Administration removes any incentive for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to negotiate. The United States should encourage direct negotiation, not dictate the agenda. We need to exercise patience to reach a lasting peace, not risk Israeli security. 
Mr. President, the Middle East peace process is taking place in a complex environment; caution--not irresponsible bravado--is required. There is no question that everyone involved wants peace in the Middle East. Yet, we must ask if our current actions are leading Israel and the Palestinian people toward security and freedom, or further from it. Putting pressure upon the people of Israel, forcing them to violate their own security needs, works against peace. 
The Middle East continues to be defined by suspicion, hatred, and a continuing arms race. Terrorism's presence can be felt everywhere-- in the markets and in the streets and cafes. And while much of the Arab world enters modernity, liberalizing economies and governments, radical Islamic extremism also grows. Anti-Semitism and the anti-Israeli refrain has not yet ceased to be heard through the souks and bazaars of the Middle East. This hatred is unfortunately a very real, very frightening, part of daily existence for the Israeli people. 
Over the past several months of bipartisan discussions and personal dialogue with the administration, I've concluded two things. First, America can continue to play a vital role in the peace process, but our role must be limited to mediator and facilitator. Second, in spite of this administration's good intentions, the United States is currently trying to lead the talks toward a false goal--the Israelis understand this and resist. The President must understand that peace through ultimatum may get him an agreement, but an agreement which may provide a risky and false peace. 
A lasting and secure peace represents the only worthy goal. And if this means that we wait and demonstrate patience and not arrogance, then we should. The U.S. will eagerly take a share of the credit for a successful agreement, but we must remember--we do not pay the price of failure. The price of failure will be paid by the Palestinian and Israeli people, who will continue to live in fear of another bus bombing in the city center, of their children being targeted in buses and cafes.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it was not my intention, frankly, to speak on the issue of Israel. But Senator Feinstein and I have a difference of opinion on this, and I feel compelled, frankly, to make a comment. 
I strongly believe the administration has made a major mistake in publicly tabling and publicly pressuring the Government of Israel in this particular set of circumstances. The administration knew at the time that the plan that was being proposed would be accepted by Arafat and rejected by Prime Minister Netanyahu. I, again, think it is fundamentally wrong for one democracy to try to impose on another democracy what it should be doing. The people of Israel have chosen its government. They have chosen this government based on what they perceive to be their No. 1 priority, which is security, and that government should not be pressured by the ally, the United States. It is fundamentally wrong. And I personally believe that to do that could end up with a forced agreement, which, in fact, would be a false peace. That would endanger the Middle East. 
Again, Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express those feelings.

Mr. MACK. I thank the Chair. 
Last week, thanks to the leadership of Finance Committee Chairman Roth, Congress resumed the first meaningful IRS oversight hearings we have conducted in decades. The testimony we heard reinforced the impression of a rogue agency that is literally out of control. As was the case when the oversight hearings began in September, some of what we heard was shocking, much of it was saddening, and all of it was angering. Witnesses testified to incidents of IRS abuse and of blatant misuse of IRS power that are simply unacceptable. 
I recall in particular the story of one taxpayer who could not be at the hearings in person but was represented by his former attorney. The reason the taxpayer could not attend was that he was literally hounded to death by the IRS. The 61-year-old taxpayer had been suffering from severe health problems. He had heart disease and was weakened by cancer. The IRS revenue officer assigned to his case was informed that the taxpayer could not physically withstand stressful situations but, with the support of his supervisor and the chief of collections, persisted in aggressive and intimidating tactics. 
I want to make this clear now about the IRS being well aware of the health conditions of the taxpayer. They had a letter, I believe, from the physician that was sent to them informing them of the condition of the taxpayer, and yet they persisted in aggressive and intimidating tactics. The IRS, disregarding this humanitarian appeal, sent the taxpayer a notice of intent to levy. 
By the way, let me back up for a moment as well. Notice I talked about that taxpayer going to his attorney. The request on the part of the attorney was that further contacts in this case be with the attorney, not the taxpayer, again because of the health condition. They totally ignored that request. And so 2 days after this levy, the man died from a heart attack. 
This story highlights, perhaps better than any other we heard, the fundamental and disgraceful problems at the IRS, an agency which never seems to consider the interests and perspective of the taxpayer. This attitude is entirely unacceptable and cannot be tolerated. The IRS Criminal Investigations Division has apparently learned from the FBI and the DEA criminal investigative techniques that are appropriate for dealing with violent and dangerous criminals and now uses these in routine criminal tax investigations of taxpayers who are neither dangerous nor violent. Taxpayers have had their businesses raided by armed agents, their lives turned upside down, and their reputations ruined. 
In listening to hours of compelling testimony, members of the Finance Committee could not help but wonder how in the world could such things be happening. Why would the IRS send 10 special agents to a woman's home at 7:30 in the morning to serve a search warrant and spend 8 hours in her home not to search for drugs or illegal contraband but, instead, so that a furniture appraiser could value items from her grandmother's estate? Who could have approved such a blatantly intrusive act? Why would the IRS send 64 agents to raid a man's family business with 35 employees at the home office? The taxpayer was not a violent or dangerous criminal. What purpose could be served by the use of 64 agents in this raid other than to intimidate and oppress the taxpayer? 
The villains of the horror stories that were presented to the Finance Committee last week were not just frontline, low-level employees of the IRS. None of these abuses could have taken place without either the approval of management or of failure in supervision. Last week's hearings exposed a corrupt culture permeating IRS management which will require a major housecleaning at the Service. 
The current oversight of the Service is just not working. The Treasury inspector general has the power to investigate IRS operations, but we learned last week that the inspector general is being ignored by the IRS. The inspector general investigated and substantiated allegations of travel fraud, abuse of subordinates, sexual harassment, fraudulent performance appraisals, and others to cover up illegal actions, all against IRS executives. Yet in each and every one of these cases the report from the inspector general was sent to the Deputy Commissioner's desk and no disciplinary action was taken. In other cases, the IRS has hindered oversight by keeping information from the inspector general. 
Now, this particular problem of inspector general oversight is addressed in the IRS reform bill that we have before us through the creation of a new inspector general for tax administration. But the problem underscores the corrupt culture at the IRS, a culture in which the decent, honest IRS employees who report abuses of their coworkers receive not thanks but retaliation. 
At the IRS, an individual who sexually harasses his subordinates can end up being the National Director of Equal Employment Opportunity. At the IRS, midlevel managers can decide to close the audits of major corporations and determine that no extra taxes are owed even when the corporation concedes that it owes more taxes. At the IRS, a renegade special agent with a drinking and substance abuse problem can fabricate 
allegations of political corruption and be protected rather than punished by his supervisors. 
This culture must change, and it is not happening. We heard last week that some IRS managers have been bragging that they have no regard for the Finance Committee's oversight hearings and that they intend to go back to business as usual once the spotlight is off. Even after we exposed the illegal use of enforcement statistics to evaluate IRS employees and offices, it seems that the southern region is still ranking their district offices based on property seizures. 
Many IRS bureaucrats appear to have concluded that we are not serious about oversight and that we are not serious about reform. We in the Congress must prove them wrong and send a strong message to the IRS and to the taxpayer that business as usual will not be tolerated. 
Since our hearings last September exposed numerous instances of taxpayer abuse, it seems that not one person has been fired at the IRS. It is my hope that the provisions in the IRS reform bill that require the termination of employees who commit certain acts such as taxpayer abuse will help correct this problem. 
Commissioner Rossotti has made a number of positive moves since taking office. He has ordered an independent review of the IRS Inspection Service, and now he has enlisted Judge William Webster for a much needed review of the Criminal Investigations Division. In order to change the corrupt culture at the IRS, it is necessary that outside people with a perspective different from that of the IRS bureaucracy be given a prominent role. 
It is for this reason that I have offered this amendment. My amendment, cosponsored by Senator Faircloth and Senator Murkowski, would move us closer to Chairman Roth's vision of a private sector oversight board by removing the Secretary of the Treasury from this board. 
The purpose of the oversight board is to reform the IRS from the outside. The board will be composed of people from the private sector, people with management and information systems expertise, people who still have the interest of the taxpayer in mind. To change the culture of the IRS, we need to replace the law enforcement mentality with a customer service mentality. The independent oversight board will play a vital role in changing this culture. There is no place on such a board for a Government official, such as the Secretary of the Treasury. The board must be the voice of the taxpayer, not the voice of the status quo. For this new board to have any credibility with the public, it must not be under the influence of the Cabinet Member who already has responsibility for the agency. 
We must prove that we are serious about reform of the IRS. Making the oversight board a private sector check on the IRS is essential for reform. Otherwise, it is just Washington business as usual with another Washington-controlled commission. That is not what we need. We need an oversight board of the taxpayers, by the taxpayers, and for the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I want to make it clear, because I realize that in these kinds of situations the impression could be drawn that I am focusing my concerns personally at the Secretary of the IRS. That is not the point at all. The Secretary of the Treasury is, frankly, reflecting the views of the bureaucracy. I find it troubling that we would have changed the legislation from the markup document that we began with, which Senator Roth proposed, which did not include members other than private sector individuals. Again, I want to stress this point. This is not directed personally at the Secretary of the Treasury, but it is a response in essence to an attempt by the bureaucracy to protect itself. 
Here is what the Secretary has said in the past with respect to this issue. 
In the Cincinnati Inquirer, on September 17, 1997, Secretary Rubin said:  
The fact that the agency was being run by private sector individuals would almost surely have what lawyers call a chilling effect on IRS employees and influence audit policy, enforcement policy, and the like. 
You bet it would. I think that is exactly the reason we had called for a board in which there were only private sector representatives on that oversight board. 
The ultimate concern that I have here is that if we are going to make a change, it should not be business as usual. It should not be a commission dominated by Washington insiders. Why do I say it would be dominated when this is a board that would be, under its present organization, nine members, six from the private sector, three not? The six private sector members, as I recall, are part-time members of this commission, this oversight board. When you add the Secretary of the Treasury, the Commissioner of the IRS, and a representative of the employees at IRS, what you have done is totally changed the makeup in this sense. There are huge bureaucracies that the Secretary of the Treasury and the other members from Government can call on who will dominate, in my opinion, the six individuals who are serving from the private sector on a part-time basis with very limited staffs. 
I want to conclude my comments by saying to those Members of the Senate who participated in hearings, not just in the Senate but also in the process outside the committee, in no way do I try to lessen the significance of the work that you have done. But this is not an issue of what we hear at hearings. This is an issue of how Washington works and how the bureaucracy will do whatever is necessary in order to protect itself. And to put the Secretary of the Treasury and a representative of the employees on this board is just business as usual, Washington protecting itself. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. I appreciate the kind comments that my colleagues have made in their disagreement over the amendment I offer today. 
Let me go to the heart of the matter as I see the argument that the Senators are making. What they are saying is that this oversight board, in essence, has no authority without the Secretary of the Treasury. I fundamentally disagree with that. The power comes from the law, not the presence of the Secretary. The authority is written into the legislation that is before the Senate today. Having the Secretary of the Treasury on that Commission does not add power. In fact, I say it reduces the power of the taxpayer, which is the intention behind, at least from my perspective, the oversight board. 
The reason we need an oversight board is because there have been decades of inadequate oversight by the people empowered to oversee the IRS--Commissioners, Secretaries, Presidents, and Congresses. The entire purpose of the oversight board is to provide to private citizens, to taxpayers, some power over the IRS. If the Secretary of the Treasury is on the board, his oversight power is not enhanced but the power of the private citizens on the board will be diluted. 
There is no guarantee that the staff of the board will be of any size at all. My fear would be that they might be detailees from the IRS and from the Treasury. 
It is not very realistic to assume that the private sector members of the oversight board can escape the dominance of the Treasury Secretary. 
There is one last argument I will respond to and then yield the floor. Should the Secretary be on the board so the board has the advantage of his knowledge and access to information? Nothing prevents the Treasury Secretary from submitting his views to the oversight board. It should be expected that the oversight board will consult with the Treasury Secretary. Input from within the Treasury Department is already guaranteed by the Commission's representation on the board. 
I think the amendment that I have offered and the perspective that I have argued, frankly, have great power. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this amendment. 
I yield back the remaining time. I believe the yeas and nays have been called for.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am proud to support my friend and colleague from Florida, Mr. Graham, as we introduce legislation to commemorate the retirement and life's work of Mr. Malcom Randall. Mr. Randall has served his country for 59 years, 55 of which were spent with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
A native of East St. Louis, Illinois, Mr. Randall graduated from St. Louis University with a master's degree in hospital administration. He was among a handful of medical leaders who began to transform the health care system for veterans at the end of World War II. Mr. Randall is the founding Director of the VA Medical Center in Gainesville, and he has served in that post for 32 years. During that time, he has also helped establish VA hospitals and outpatient clinics in other Florida cities. The VA Medical Center in Gainesville now serves 10,000 inpatients and handles 250,000 outpatient visits per year. 
Mr. Randall is America's longest serving administrator of veterans' health care services. He has won numerous awards for his exceptional service, including recognition for `most outstanding performance' on two occasions. He is retiring today, and while I am pleased that he will be able to take some time off to enjoy his years, I am saddened that the Department and the Center will be losing one of its greatest champions, and one of its most dedicated public servants. 
In further recognition of Mr. Randall's dedication to serving the needs of America's veterans, Bob Graham and I are proposing legislation to rename the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida as the `Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center'. Our legislation is identical to legislation offered by Representative Karen Thurman in the House of Representatives, which is supported by most of the Florida Congressional delegation. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to recognize and honor the work and service of Malcom Randall, and I wish Mr. Randall well in his future pursuits.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in the United States Senate in congratulating the people of Northern Ireland for their tremendous courage and perseverence which allowed for the signing of the historic peace agreement. With continued political leadership and the inspiring dedication of the Northern Ireland people, I am optimistic that peace may be at hand. 
I traveled to Northern Ireland this past January. In fact, I arrived on the date that the latest initiative which led to the peace agreement arrived: January 12. During three days there, as the parties reviewed the details and held discussions with their constituencies, I developed a deep admiration for the political leaders who eventually accepted this agreement. 
The concurrent resolution which we are submitting today seeks to thank all of the people who contributed to this peace agreement; I wish to personally thank all of the people who spent time listening to and talking with me. 
Mr. President, I learned a great deal about politics and courage from the representatives of the political parties in Northern Ireland. I found that politicians in Northern Ireland share many of the challenges that politicians face in the United States Senate. Specifically, they often spend hours of each day in very difficult negotiations which may result in dramatic changes in the lives of those they represent. Following these meetings, they face their constituencies and justify their actions. The difference, however, between our jobs and theirs lies in the stakes. These people literally risked their lives by engaging in the peace process; they risked their lives to endorse this agreement; and they continue to bear this risk as the process continues. 
Mr. President, the American people recognize the incredible risks these leaders take, and we thank them. To these brave men and women, however, the reward diminishes the risk. If this agreement succeeds as planned, it may alter the course of history. Because of this brave sacrifice, the people of Northern Ireland have the promise of security, freedom, prosperity and an end to indiscriminate killings and terrorist acts. 
Mr. President, our concurrent resolution thanks a lot of people. But for me, the most inspiring people I met were outside of Belfast. The role of the community leaders cannot be overemphasized. While the negotiations proceeded in Belfast, at homes, neighborhoods and towns across the region, people were building local relationships which crossed borders and communities. These are the true heroes of the peace process. The people I met are making changes and making a differences where they live. They support the political process, but were not waiting around for anything coming from the capitals. Spending time among the people in the border regions, with the strongest faith in their abilities to make a difference in their own towns and neighborhoods, I became convinced that peace had a chance in Northern Ireland. 
I salute all of the people of Ireland and Norther Ireland today who have labored for peace. They are the driving force behind the peace process, and they will make it work.

We see that competition in the 21st century will be based on knowledge, and that if our children and our grandchildren are going to be able to compete in this next century, they must have an education second to none. 
Quality teachers produce quality students. We believe this amendment will increase the number of quality teachers in the school system today.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and congratulate Michael Todd, an Army Veteran and fellow Floridian who was recently selected by the Jewish War Veterans Organization to participate as a non-Jewish delegate on the Allied Veterans' Mission to Israel. Nominated by the Oskar Schindler Post of the Jewish War Veterans in Port Charlotte, Mr. Todd was West Coast Florida's only representative on the goodwill trip to Israel from April 5-April 13, 1998. 
As a U.S. Army combat soldier, Mr. Todd was wounded four times and highly decorated for his valor and meritorious service during the Vietnam War. Since his return from Vietnam in 1974, Mr. Todd has volunteered on behalf of veterans throughout Florida and the nation. He founded and is the current President of both the National Veterans for America, and the South Gulf Coast Regional Veterans Council of Florida. Furthermore, Mr. Todd is an active member of various veterans organizations, ranging from the American Legion to the Vietnam Veterans of America. 
In addition, the Charlotte County, Florida Board of County Commissioners has issued a proclamation declaring April 21, 1998 as `Michael Todd Day.' In the proclamation, the County Commissioners praised Mr. Todd's efforts to improve the lives of veterans of the armed forces and their family members. 
Mr. Todd's tireless volunteer service deserves the respect and admiration of Congress, the Country and Charlotte County. I am proud to offer my congratulations and look forward to hearing about his experiences while on his mission to Israel. I have no doubt he will continue to represent the Jewish War Veterans and the United States of America with honor.

Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Today, Senator D'Amato and I are offering an amendment that would provide incentives for States to establish teacher testing and merit pay programs. I have said many times in the discussion about education that our children deserve an education that is second to none. I have listened to educators from my home state of Florida who have talked with educators in other countries. The consensus is that competition among nations in the 21st century will not be based on natural resources or military power, but on knowledge. 
I believe that they are correct, and if our children and our grandchildren--and I am proud to state that I have three grandsons, 13, 11 and 4--if they are going to have an opportunity to compete in the 21st century, and if they are going to have an opportunity to experience the opportunities that we have had, then they have to have an education that is second to none. 
Good teachers are the backbone to a good education. All students deserve to be taught by well-educated, competent and qualified teachers. Teachers make all the difference in the learning process. America's classrooms are staffed with many dedicated, knowledgeable and hard-working teachers. But we need to reward teachers for their efforts. 
I have traveled all around my State and, for that matter, around our Nation trying to make myself more knowledgeable about the issues related to education. I have told the story many times about an experience I had out in Los Angeles where I went to visit a school called the Marcus Garvey School and met the Administrator/Principal, Anyim Palmer. Mr. Palmer assigned a teacher to take my wife and I around the school. 
I was excited, and in some ways almost overwhelmed with what I saw. These youngsters, some of whom were 2 years old, could recite the alphabet in three languages. I want to restate that --2 years old, not second grade; 2 years old. There were 3-year-old children who could do complicated addition problems and 4-year-old students who could read at the second and third grade level. A 5-year-old student stood up in front of me and was asked by the teacher to recite all the Presidents of the United States in their proper chronological order, and the little fellow did it. I must tell you, the only reason I was sure he was correct was because they gave me a piece of paper that I could follow along with to make sure that he was doing it correctly. But he was 5 years old. 
I would like to also point out that Anyim Palmer challenged one of the best private schools in the Los Angeles area's sixth grade students against his third grade students in math and English. And you know who won--Anyim Palmer's Marcus Garvey School students. 
Every single time I asked him how he accomplished this and what makes this possible, the answer was simple, `It's the teacher.' `It's the teacher.' `It's the teacher that makes the difference.' That is why, in this education reform proposal, we have placed so much emphasis on the abilities of teachers. 
Let me give you a couple of statistics: 20 percent of English classes were taught by teachers who did not have at least a minor in English, literature, communications, speech, journalism, English education or reading education. 
Another example: In our public schools today, 25 percent of mathematics classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in mathematics or mathematics education; 39 percent of life science or biology classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in biology or life sciences; 56 percent of physical science classes were taught by teachers without at least a minor in physics, chemistry, geology or Earth sciences. I could go on. 
One additional point I want to make is that students in schools with the highest minority enrollments have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and a degree in the field he or she teaches. 
Our amendment, which is referred to as the MERIT Act, rewards States that test teachers on their subject matter knowledge and pays teachers based on merit. Here is how it works: 
We will make half of any additional funding over the fiscal year 1999 level for the Eisenhower Program available to States that periodically test elementary and secondary school teachers and reward teachers based on merit and proven performance. 
There will be no reduction in current funding to States under this program based on this amendment. All current money being spent on this program is unaffected by this amendment. Only additional money will be used as an incentive. 
Finally, this amendment also enables States to use Federal education money to establish and administer teacher testing and merit pay programs. 
Mr. President, I now yield to Senator D'Amato.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Kerry and I introduce the Technical Workers Fairness Act of 1998. This bill would repeal Section 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, something that is long overdue and is now supported by a strong bipartisan consensus. 
Section 1706 added a new subsection (d) to Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. For the class of businesses known as `technical services firms' who provide technical services to their customers, Section 1706 removed the Section 530 employment tax safe harbors that otherwise apply to all other types of businesses that use the services of independent contractors. These Section 530 safe harbors were enacted by Congress in 1978 to protect business taxpayers, especially small businesses, from arbitrary IRS decisions interpreting the common law employment test in employment tax audits. 
Yet Section 1706 leaves one group of taxpayers back in the pre-Section 530 days. As a result of Section 1706, if a technical services firm hires, as an independent contractor, a computer programmer, systems analyst, software engineer, or similarly-skilled worker who will perform services for that firm's customers, then the technical services firm--which is operating in a so-called `three-party' arrangement--must prove to the IRS that this worker is an independent contractor under the centuries-old common law employment test that Congress found so troublesome in 1978. Even if the firm can show that it has a reasonable basis for treating the worker as an independent contractor--for instance, if its past treatment of this worker as an independent contractor was approved by the IRS in prior IRS audits, or its treatment is consistent with industry practice or a relevant court ruling, all of which constitute a `safe harbor' under Section 530--none of these factors is relevant because of the enactment of Section 1706. 
The harm caused to the technical services industry and its workers by Section 1706 is more than theoretical. Technical services firms which use independent contractors--even if they act in good faith--can be severely penalized by the IRS and forced to pay `unpaid' employment taxes even though the contractors have already paid these same taxes in full. In fact, some IRS auditors have used Section 1706 to claim that even incorporated independent contractors are not legitimate. Left with only the common law employment test to demonstrate a worker's status to the IRS, many technical services firms will not hire any independent contractors in order to avoid tempting an IRS audit. 
In 1991, the Treasury Department issued a 100-page study of Section 1706, as required by Congress. The Treasury Study found that tax compliance is actually better-than-average among technical services workers compared to other contractors in other industries. It also found the scope of Section 1706 was `difficult to justify on equity or other policy considerations.' Further, Section 1706 is the only occasion since the enactment of Section 530 that Congress has ever cut back on the safe harbor protections in Section 530. In fact, in response to concerns that IRS decisions in independent contractor audits were too often arbitrary and unpredictable, in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 Congress expanded the Section 530 protections and even shifted the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS. More recently, the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics found that many high-tech professionals are actually being forced to work as employees when their preference is to be independent contractors. 
It is time to repeal Section 1706 and end the discrimination against this one industry.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, there has been a good deal of concern over whether the budget resolution actually provides adequate funding to allow the Labor-HHS subcommittee to provide increased funding for the National Institutes of Health as assumed in the budget. 
After extensive conversations with the Chairman of the Budget Committee Chairman and his staff, I am confident that the recommendations contained in the budget resolution would in fact allow for increased funding of the National Institutes of Health. 
In fact, the Chairman of the Budget Committee has agreed to enter into a colloquy with me which explicitly states that the budget assumes a substantial increase over the Labor-HHS subcommittee's 1998 appropriated levels. The chairman has assured me that this funding level assumes increases to cover shortfall created by forward funding in last years Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Additionally, the budget assumes further increases to fund a number of Congressional priorities, including increased funding for the National Institutes of Health. 
The full content of the colloquy is contained in a written statement which I will now send to the desk and ask that it be entered into the Record in its entirety. 
Mr. President, as my colleagues will recall, during consideration of the 1998 Budget Resolution, I offered an amendment to express the sense of the Senate that funding for the National Institutes of Health should be increased by 100 percent over the next five years. It passed by a vote of 98-0. 
The amendment I am offering today will help to ensure that the Senate continues to move forward toward achieving this goal. The 1999 Senate Budget Resolution assumes an increase of $1.5 billion for the National Institutes of Health for FY 1999, an 11% increase over the FY 1998 funding level. 
I know the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, has worked very hard in a tight budget year to include this increase in the Budget Resolution. I want to express my sincere thanks to Chairman Domenici and commend him for his leadership on this initiative. He, too, has been a true friend to NIH and I know he shares our commitment to increased funding for biomedical research. 
I am aware of concerns raised by patient organizations and public health advocacy organizations with respect to future increases for NIH. 
Based upon discussions I have had with both Chairman Domenici and with Chairman Stevens today, I am convinced the budget resolution will, in fact, lead to the increases necessary to achieve the goal of doubling funding for NIH. 
I have submitted into the Record a colloquy with Senator Domenici which addresses these concerns, and I encourage all interested parties to review this colloquy. 
It is also important to remember that the Congress is at the beginning of the budget process. The House of Representatives has not acted on the Budget Resolution. There still must be a conference with the House. 
At this time, I am convinced the Budget Committee has done its' best to provide the framework to increase funding for NIH by at least $1.5 billion in FY 1999. And, I am hopeful that the Appropriations Committee will do its best to support these recommendations. 
For purposes of this Budget Resolution, I do believe it is important for the Senate to be on record with respect to our bipartisan commitment to NIH. 
To that end, the amendment I offer today will express the Sense of the Senate in three areas. 
First, it would reaffirm our commitment to double funding for NIH over the next five years. 
Second, it would express the Sense of the Senate that appropriations for NIH should be increased by $2 billion in FY 1999. 
Finally, it would express the Sense of the Senate that, at a minimum, appropriations for NIH should match the levels specified in the Budget Resolution. 
Funding for NIH has always enjoyed strong bipartisan support in the Senate. Today should be no exception. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. MACK. Senator Domenici, I understand that an assumption in this Budget Resolution considers that receipts from the sale of the surplus public lands could be used to fund recovery efforts on private land for endangered species. I would like to clarify that this would in no way alter the current arrangement with the Everglades Recovery Program which is also funded by land sales.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President one of my top priorities since coming to Congress has been support of programs to eradicate the effects of cancer and other diseases that affect the people of the United States. I know many here in the Senate share my concerns who have joined me in seeking to increase funding substantially for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Indeed, the goal of this group as stated last year is to double funding for NIH over 5 years. 
I am pleased that the Budget Resolution takes a substantial step toward meeting this goal and thank the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Domenici, for recommending a funding increase of $1.5 billion in FY1999 and $15.5 billion through 2003. 
However, I would mention to the Chair that there has been much concern expressed by many public health advocacy groups that the Budget Resolution levels for the Appropriations' Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education will not support this increase. Accordingly, I would ask the floor manager to alleviate these concerns by answering a few simple questions for me. 
Has the Budget Committee assumed sufficient funds in their budget recommendation to allow the Labor-HHS subcommittee to match its 302(b) allocation from last year?

Mr. MACK. Thank you, Madam President. I want to begin my comments by also recognizing those individuals who have worked so hard on trying to come up with language that can be accepted by all of us. But, frankly, I am one of those individuals who believes that we have not gone far enough. 
With all due respect to my colleague from Maryland, I think this is exactly the time we should be requiring change in the IMF. We were told back during the Mexico crisis that once we got that problem solved, we would do what was necessary to address the problems in international financial institutions. We have not done that, and I make the case again. As my colleague said, he has been critical of the IMF in the past. My conclusion is the only time we can ever get action is, in fact, when there is a crisis at hand, and that is why I have felt so strongly that we needed to put conditions on that could be carried out and would be carried out. 
What we are being told now, in essence, is, `We will make our best effort.' The implication also is that the United States and those of us who want to put conditions on the IMF, that the United States is the only one that is interested in doing that. I disagree with that. I think there are other nations and members of the G-7 that want to see changes made. 
I think we ought to insist on this. I think the first $3.5 billion was sufficient to take care of the problems; the other $14.5 billion could be made available later after changes have been made. But I am convinced now that, frankly, we didn't have the votes to go as far as I would like to go. I understand that. 
I appreciate the efforts that have been made on both sides of this issue, but I feel compelled, Madam President, to cast a vote against this proposal. I thank you and yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, I want to thank the Members of the Senate for their cooperation in this effort. Senator Wellstone and I have been attempting to get this resolution to the floor for some time now, but because of the cooperation of Chairman Helms and many others, we have now worked our way through to the point where we, in fact, could bring this resolution to the floor and, hopefully, within not too long a period of time have agreement on this resolution. 
My resolution, introduced with Senator Wellstone and 11 other Senators, urges the President to take all action necessary to introduce and pass a resolution at the annual meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission critical of the human rights abuses in China and Tibet. I hope the President will take note and take action. This resolution passed out of the Foreign Relations Committee yesterday by a vote of 16 to 1. Again, I express my appreciation to Senators Wellstone, Helms, Thomas, Lugar, Coverdell, Feingold, Hagel, Biden, and a number of others. With this action, the committee voiced its strong support for the passage of this resolution unamended. 
Now I would like to state five points as to why we should pass the resolution now. 
First, we know that offering and debating this resolution at the annual U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva advances human rights in China and Tibet. We know that in past years the Government in Beijing has made gestures towards improving human rights just prior to the annual Human Rights Commission consideration of a China resolution. 
We know from testimony by Wei Jingsheng, Harry Wu, and many other political prisoners, that conditions for political prisoners improve when the resolution is being debated and they deteriorate when the resolve of the United States weakens. Again, I learned this not just from testimony before committees but I learned it from personal experiences and discussion with both Mr. Wei Jingsheng and Mr. Harry Wu, who actually told us they could tell the rhythm, if you will, of what was going on in the world by the way they were treated in prison in China. They knew, when things were slackened, that there was resolve in the world to take China to task over its human rights violations. And they knew as well, when they were in difficult times and experiencing tremendous abuse, that the world had turned its back on those who found themselves in prison in China. 
Mr. President, we know our approach to China must include public and private actions and must encompass trade, national security, and human rights. This Commission is uniquely suited to be the forum for the world to express disapproval of human rights violations in China and in Tibet. 
Finally, we know the United States assessment of human rights in China and Tibet, according to the State Department, is abysmal by any standard. The United States must state plainly and clearly our objection to Beijing's denial of basic freedoms to the people of China and to Tibet. 
Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, many times in the past, as I have talked about foreign policy and national defense issues, I have gone back to what I believe is the fundamental principle that has served as the foundation of our Nation, and that is the discussion about freedom. I have said over and over again that I believe freedom is the core of all human progress, that the message of freedom is the message of hope. 
Again, thinking of individuals who would find themselves imprisoned in China today, I, too, have heard them say that the knowledge that there are people around the world--particularly people in the United States--who will say it's important enough to confront the leadership in China on the issue of human rights gives them hope that there are people in the world who care about them. So the message of freedom is a message of hope. 
I want to quote a comment that was made by Mr. Wei in November of last year when he came to the United States. This is what he had to say: 
Democracy and freedom are among the loftiest ideals of humanity, and they are the most sacred rights of mankind. Those who already enjoy democracy, liberty, and human rights in particular, should not allow their own personal happiness to numb them into forgetting the many others who are still struggling against tyranny, slavery, and poverty, and all of those who are suffering from unimaginable forms of oppression, exploitation, and massacre. 
What would it be like to be imprisoned? I have also read some of the writings, such as the book of Harry Wu, for example. I have heard the stories of the conditions in which other human beings have found themselves and I wonder myself, could I survive that? Would I have the human drive, the human will to survive? Probably, if I felt that I was alone, with no concern for me whatsoever, maybe the will would disappear. Maybe the will for Mr. Wu would have disappeared. Maybe the will for Mr. Wei would have disappeared. But there was a belief that there were those out there who cared for them. 
Now, the point has been raised several times: Why China? Why only China? I think the Senator from Minnesota will agree with me that there is a condition that exists now as a result of a decision made by President Clinton not long ago to delink the issue of trade and human rights. Now, there are rational points on both sides of that debate. But the point is, that decision was made. So then the question then comes, if we are not going to engage in a debate over human rights with the issue of trade, where are we going to do it? 
It seems to me it is a reasonable, rational position to take that the debate ought to take place in the United Nations about violations of human rights. So we are very simply saying to our colleagues in the U.S. Senate, and to the President of the United States, we believe now is the time to move forward to condemn China for its human rights violations and to make it a cause. I am not shy about saying that. I believe we should do it. I don't think that, in any way, we are going to make things tougher for the people of China as a result of it. In fact, everyone we have had the opportunity to talk with has indicated to us that their treatment improves when the United States raises these concerns. So, Mr. President, I hope we do have a strong vote for this resolution, and I believe we will. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Capital Gains Simplification Act of 1998. This legislation will significantly improve the tax treatment of capital gains and would benefit all Americans. It would restore the one-year holding period (from the current 18 month requirement) to qualify for the lower capital gains tax rates the Republican Congress enacted last year. This simple change would dramatically reduce tax compliance costs, lessen the punitive lock-in effect on capital, and yield additional federal revenue in the first two years. 
Capital investment is the key to economic growth and our future standard of living. That's why we successfully fought to give the American people significant tax relief on their savings and investments last year. We reduced the top rate on capital gains from 28 percent to 20 percent. Typical taxpayers in the 15 percent tax bracket had their capital gains tax rate lowered even more--to 10 percent. 
Unfortunately, in order for taxpayers to qualify for lower capital gains tax rates, the Clinton Administration dictated an increase in the holding period from one year to 18 months when the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 was in conference. This arbitrary new holding period creates an awkward rate structure in which gains held between 12 and 18 months are taxed at higher rates. This dramatically and unnecessarily complicates tax calculations and compliance costs for taxpayers, investment firms, and the IRS. 
For most Americans, their tax accounting and investment changes are timed on a one year basis, thus making the new 18-month holding period out of sync with investment and tax filing standards. This longer holding period also reduces economic efficiency and the flow of capital by artificially locking-in investments for longer durations. Additionally, Americans who may need to sell an investment before holding it 18 months--for instance, to pay a tuition bill or medial expense--are punished with higher tax rates under current law. This makes little sense and must be corrected. 
My bill would restore a straightforward one-year holding period for capital gains. It would greatly simplify the tax compliance burden, reduce punitive taxation, and improve economic efficiency. Simply stated, it would make it easier and more rewarding for Americans to save and invest for their futures. 
New entrepreneurial activity that boosts economic growth takes money, and the demands for capital are the greatest they have been in decades. New technologies are opening the door to 
greater productivity gains and new products. We must ensure that the adequate savings and investment needed to fuel new technologies and productivity gains are available. 
Any tax on capital gains represents punitive double taxation, and often taxes illusory gains due simply to inflation. And capital gains are not just for the `rich.' According to IRS tax return data, 54 percent of taxpayers reporting capital gains have incomes below $50,000--meaning more than 8 million households earning less than $50,000 can benefit from the capital gains tax relief Congress provided last year. Many senior citizens depend on cashing in their capital gains as their major source of income during retirement. More than 80 percent of capital gains are reported by households with less than $100,000 in income. 
It's no secret that a large and growing number of ordinary middle-income Americans are directly or indirectly invested in the stock market. They invest directly by buying shares themselves or indirectly through savings in mutual funds, IRA accounts, or pension plans at work. The proportion of families who own stocks has increased dramatically. By simplifying the tax treatment of capital gains, this legislation would encourage families to save even more and would make it easier for them to buy a home, prepare for retirement, or pay for their children's education. 
Let's not forget that capital gains taxes are largely a voluntary tax, since investors decide when they sell their assets. Investors should be allowed to freely move their money into new investments without paying punitive tax rates due to arbitrary holding periods. Locking up capital with longer holding periods can only diminish our chances of achieving our greatest growth potential. 
By returning the capital gains holding period to one year, the Capital Gains Simplification Act would cut tax compliance costs, but more importantly, it would help unleash greater investment opportunities, create jobs, and boost growth to the benefit of all Americans.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it is time we end the practice of earmarking highway projects. This practice continues to disadvantage my state, and most others. Commonly referred to as demonstration projects, these earmarked dollars literally come off the top of the transportation funding available under this legislation. 
The rationale behind apportionment formulas and funding allocations is that these transportation funds are distributed according to state's needs. Notwithstanding disagreements over whether these distributions accurately reflect a state's transportation needs, the practice of authorizing demonstration projects undermines the rationale supporting the use of these formulas. Moreover, this practice literally deprives states of the funding which would otherwise be available for states' highway priorities as established by state and local transportation planners. 
While I believe this is a wasteful practice, history has shown there is little chance of its outright elimination. Beginning in 1982 when $362 million was set-aside for 10 such earmarks, the inclusion of such earmarks has continued to grow as illustrated in the 1991 transportation bill, ISTEA, where over $6 billion was provided for 538 location specific projects. 
While the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee has shown great restraint in this area, it is well understood that the House of Representatives has been unable to curtail this practice. In fact, the House is fully expected to come forward this year with billions of dollars in transportation earmarks. 
Accordingly, the amendment offered by Senator McCain does the next best thing. It requires that any highway demonstration projects come from within a state's total funding and not at the expense of funding otherwise available to all other states. 
For all my colleagues who have argued in favor of the formulas contained in the bill and the rationale behind them, support of this provision remains consistent with that position. And, for those of my colleagues who are not as enthusiastic over the distribution of highway dollars in the underlying legislation, this provision will ensure that your states prospective return on their transportation dollar will not be eroded any further. 
I look forward to the overwhelming support of my colleagues on this common sense amendment, and I thank Senator McCain for his excellent work in crafting this provision.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. It calls for repealing the 4.3-cent gas tax, while ensuring deficit-neutrality through a corresponding reduction in overall spending caps. So the first point I want to make to my colleagues is that this is, in essence, budget neutral. 
In 1993, when President Clinton and a Democratic Congress raised the gas tax 4.3 cents, they did so for deficit reduction purposes. Again, I do not think I have to remind my colleagues it was a pretty contentious debate. The underlying bill ended up passing, I believe, by one vote. However, it seems clear now that this tax is no longer needed. All the estimates that we are receiving from many, many different sources would indicate that we are going to see surpluses out for many years to come. However, rather than to return this tax, the Congress is on the verge of retaining this tax for increased transportation spending, having succumbed to a multiyear campaign by the transportation industry. 
The industry vehemently maintains that the gas tax's user fee is paid by a consumer who believes gas taxes will be used for transportation purposes. However, this is simply not the case. Gas taxes being used for deficit reduction is not a unique event. What many do not know, or simply will not acknowledge, is that the gas tax was created for deficit reduction purposes, and for the first 20 years had been used for that purpose. It was for the same purpose that the 4.3-cent gas tax was enacted in 1993. However, this Congress is one that is committed to fiscal restraint and providing tax relief to America's working men and women. It is much different than the Congresses of the last several decades, which were all too willing to commit and spend taxpayers' dollars. It seems to me that this Congress ought to return to the taxpayer this now unnecessary deficit reduction gas tax, and, in so doing, we can provide tax relief directly to the men and women who need it most--America's working class who drive on our Nation's roads every day. 
This tax should be repealed. The American people were asked to contribute more money at the pump so that we might achieve a balanced budget. And we did. But nobody has gone back to the American people and asked them if their money can be kept for increased spending. It seems to me this is a question which ought to be asked. I am confident that almost all of us have heard from our States claiming that they need more transportation dollars. They have asked for more flexibility in spending their transportation dollars, and they have complained about the bureaucratic red tape which accompanies gas tax dollars funneled through Washington. 
Repeal of the 4.3 cents offers the Congress a way of meeting all of these goals. First, it keeps the faith with the taxpaying public by returning a deficit reduction tax which is no longer needed. Again, I remind everyone, there was a very strong debate about this, passing a 4.3-cent gasoline tax for the purpose of deficit reduction. It was almost implied--in fact, I guess if I went back and pulled up the various speeches, I am sure that there were those who said, when there is, in 
fact, no longer a deficit, this tax will be repealed and returned to the taxpayer. 
Secondly, it gives States the opportunity to replace this tax with one of their own. This gives the taxpaying public ample opportunity to have their voices heard on the issue of whether this gas tax should be lowered again or kept in place for increased transportation spending. 
Finally, should the States and the respective taxpayers support using the gas tax for increased transportation spending, it would be free from Federal strings and available for the States' priorities, not Washington's. Estimates from transportation economists and several State secretaries of transportation suggest that without Federal interference, mandates, and restrictions, a State could get as much as 20 to 40 percent more for their gas tax dollars. 
As a final point, according to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service, since 1990, two-thirds of all States have increased their own gas taxes. This clearly indicates that our Nation's States have the will and the ability to increase their own gas taxes should they need them and should their citizens choose to do so. 
So I say to my colleagues, let us repeal this 4.3-cent gas tax which we told the American people would be used to achieve a balanced budget. Let us give them a chance to consider, with their State legislators, whether they are willing to see this tax used for increased transportation spending. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues, I have nothing but the greatest of respect for each of you as well. We all know that we come to the floor with different interests in this debate. I suspect if the addition of the 4.3 cents that I believe Senator Chafee added during this debate on the underlying bill, that probably, if that 4.3 cents had gone back to each individual State as the money was contributed, it would be much harder for me to be here today offering an amendment to repeal it. 
But I think it is fair to say from the perspective of a donor State--and I might add, a donor State for the past 41 years--that we are just kind of saying the time has arrived in which we think there ought to be greater equity in the allocation of funds and we believe that our States, and again the 29 donor States, would be better off with the 4.3 cents coming back to their individual States for them to make a determination about how it should be spent. 
I just happen to believe, and many transportation economists support it, that the dollars spent in States themselves are more efficiently used, more effectively used, the purchasing power is much greater. Again, I respect the perspective that my colleagues on the other side of this issue raise, but I have a totally different viewpoint. 
The second point I raise is that the comment was made a few moments ago that somehow or another if I were to be successful in this amendment--and I think we all know before we have a vote what the outcome is going to be. I make a point that if we were to repeal this, to then assume that all of these funds would then not be spent for highway construction is fundamentally flawed. 
I indicated in my opening comments that State after State has raised their own gasoline taxes to be spent at home, and I say those States--and I suspect mine would be one of them because we do have tremendous needs with respect to transportation, whether that be mass transit or whether that be highway construction--have tremendous needs and I am confident that the State legislatures would, in fact, address the issue of the 4.3-cent repeal. 
Again, the budget's bottom line is the 29 donor States would be much better off if, in fact, they were able to collect this money and set their own priorities. So that is, again, one of the reasons that I have offered this amendment. 
The last point I make before I yield to others is that the original bill had been crafted without this new funding. Any funding attributable to the 4.3 cents has been provided as a totally separate section of the committee's original bill. 
I don't think we are destroying the underlying work. I say to my colleagues, I look at this in a sense as two different packages. One, there is the underlying bill; and then the other has to do with how the 4.3 cents is divided up. 
Again, my intention here is not to destroy the work that the committee has so diligently done, and in no way do I mean to imply by the offering of this amendment that I don't appreciate the work you have done to try to accommodate us. Each of us knows there is a point at which we have to stand up for our own beliefs, and the time has arrived with respect to this issue. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. If I may take a couple of minutes to respond, and then I think my colleague, Senator Graham, will seek recognition, I think it is fair to say that the so-called donor States, some of the more densely populated States, have recognized the needs of western States. I grant that there are unique situations that exist among the different States of our Nation. 
I might just say I don't think in my wildest imagination that if this amendment would pass, we would have created, then, 50 nations, but I understand the point that my colleague is trying to make. 
We understand and I think that, by our actions in the past, we recognize that. But the concept, when the Interstate Highway System was put into effect, in fact, was an interstate system. It was done for a national or Federal purpose. That is, in fact, why the formulas were initially created. But I again make the argument that--and I think most people would agree--for all intents and purposes, the Interstate System has been completed. 
While I probably would go much further than this amendment, all I am suggesting is that we take the 4.3-cent gasoline tax, which was originally passed for the purpose of deficit reduction, and eliminate that. I think it is fair to say that we do have an interstate system that is in place. States like mine recognize the needs of other States around the Nation. We helped build those, pay for those, and maintain those. But now it's time to recognize that there is a new era, that things have in fact changed. The Interstate System is built. There is no longer a deficit--at least, we are being told that--and it is safe to assume that, for as far as we can see, there will be surpluses. There ought to be a repeal of the tax. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Madam President, before I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for a waiver of the Budget Act, I cannot help but respond to my delightful colleague from Alaska. 
First of all, with respect to Eisenhower, if you go back and read the record, Eisenhower indicated that he was in favor of repealing the gas tax when the interstate system was completed. So I think if he had the opportunity, we would know where he stood on this issue. 
In respect to the comments made about Florida and Alaska and oil and so forth, I remind my colleagues, I am talking about 4.3 cents of the gasoline tax. That is point 1. 
Point 2, we have supported the interstate system for 41 years, and there will be sufficient funds to, in fact, maintain the interstate system after the repeal of the 4.3 cents. 
I just could not let those comments go without responding. 
At this point, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Taxpayer Confidentiality Act of 1998. This bill corrects an inequity in the way that taxpayers are treated by the IRS. Under current law, communications between taxpayers and their lawyers concerning tax advice can often be protected from disclosure to the IRS by the common law attorney-client privilege. 
Many taxpayers choose to obtain their tax advice from practitioners who are not attorneys. Under federal law, there are other categories of tax practitioners to whom these taxpayers can turn for tax advice--certified public accountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, and attorneys providing advice in the role of a tax practitioner. These tax practitioners are subject to federal regulation, and are authorized to provide tax advice and to represent taxpayers before the IRS. 
But under current law, communications with these other tax practitioners cannot be protected from disclosure to the IRS by a client privilege. The very same words on the very same piece of paper that would be beyond the reach of the IRS if they were the advice of an attorney at law would have to be turned over to the IRS if they came from a certified public accountant or an enrolled agent. This is an unfair penalty to impose on a taxpayer based on their choice of tax advisor, particularly since many taxpayers do not have the financial resources to hire legal counsel. 
The Taxpayer Confidentiality Act of 1998 fixes this unjust situation, and provides taxpayers with the confidence of knowing that their tax advice communications with any federally-authorized tax practitioners are afforded equal confidentiality protections in dealings with the IRS. 
This bill does not unduly restrict the ability of the IRS to gather information. The IRS will still be able to discover the facts. The taxpayer can protect from disclosure only tax advice communications that would be protected by the attorney-client privilege if the advisor were acting as an attorney. The client privilege extends only to communications and does not cover the taxpayer's business records. Also, courts have widely held that information used to prepare a tax return is not subject to a privilege and thus, under the Act, would remain subject to disclosure. 
The bill will not hinder criminal investigations and prosecutions, as taxpayers can assert the privilege only in noncriminal matters before the IRS and noncriminal judicial proceedings arising from these matters. And existing exceptions to the attorney-client confidentiality privilege would also apply to the protections under the bill. Thus, communications in the furtherance of a crime or a fraud would not be protected. 
And the bill does not affect the ability of anyone other than the IRS--including other federal or state agencies, and private individuals involved in civil litigation--to obtain access to information that they have the right under current law to obtain. It is just a narrowly-tailored, common-sense solution to the problem of treating taxpayers differently based on the tax advisor they employ. Taxpayers should have a right to privacy in the tax advice they receive from qualified tax practitioners. 
The Taxpayer Confidentiality Act of 1998 does not modify the attorney-client privilege in any way, and does not expand the authority of federally-regulated tax practitioners in any way. It merely provides equal treatment for all taxpayers who receive tax advice from federally-authorized sources. The Act curbs unwarranted IRS intrusiveness, and must be included in our IRS reform efforts.

Mr. MACK. I just want to address myself to comments that were made by Senator Levin a little earlier with respect to, frankly, those of us who are considered donor States. We are still looking for more information. I understand from your point of view we have all the information that there is to have, and we ought to have sufficient data to make decisions about where we are on this amendment. 
I would say to the distinguished Senator that last evening several of us met with our staffs, going over, asking questions about what the impact of the amendment would be to our individual States. There was no clarity last night. We called and asked for a meeting this morning with individuals from the highway department, to come down and go over the data with us. They did so this morning. We asked for additional information. They are working on getting that information back to us. We hope sometime this afternoon that information would be available to us. We will then be in a better position to evaluate just exactly where we are. 
I must say, maybe it is because I am dealing from a position of real extreme frustration, representing a State that we believe under the old proposal had about 77 cents back for what we had contributed in the past, in the last year. I remember the debates and the discussions that we had 5 years ago, kind of saying, `This is never going to happen to us again,' that is being a donor State to the extent that we have been. 
So we are concerned and we do not feel that we have enough data to make a decision. We think it is unfair to say, let's just go ahead and move this amendment at this time. We do not have, and have not had, the time that you all have had over these last several months to be working on this bill. We have this opportunity now to try to evaluate what the amendment does. We are making a reasonable request. We are not trying to delay the bill. So, I ask the amendment be set aside until we have an opportunity to get this information and we can then discuss how we proceed.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution calling for the United States to introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights criticizing the People's Republic of China (PRC) for its atrocious human rights record in China and Tibet. This commission will meet on March 16, so I am here today with a sense of urgency. 
Mr. President, President Clinton reversed his position in 1993 and chose to de-link trade and human rights in 1993. This decision sacrificed important leverage in our relationship with the PRC to address America's human rights concerns. At the time of the President's decision, however, he promised the American people that he would strengthen his efforts to obtain an international condemnation of Beijing's violation of international human rights standards in China and Tibet. Specifically, he pledged that the United States would step up its efforts in cooperation with other states in insisting that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights pass a resolution dealing with the serious human rights abuses in the People's Republic of China. 
Mr. President, this Human Rights Commission meets in Geneva on March 16, and to date, the President has not demonstrated his commitment to keep his pledge to the American people. It appears that no other nation on the Commission will initiate this resolution without U.S. support and leadership. It is time for the United States to provide that leadership--the leadership which the people of China depend upon. We must take action to introduce the China resolution at the Human Rights Commission and build international support for its passage.

Mr. MACK. I thank the distinguished Senator from California for yielding this time. I have prepared remarks that I have gone over with my staff that cover things like it is obvious that there is no medical or ethical justification for human cloning. We all understand that. We also know there have been no hearings. We know as well that we have information from 27 Nobel laureates who say we should not pass this legislation. We have letters from 71 patient groups and scientific organizations that say we should not do this. 
But let me say to my colleagues that I stand here this morning to make a special appeal. My father died of cancer. My mother died of cancer. My brother died of cancer. I was diagnosed with cancer. My wife was diagnosed with cancer. Our daughter was diagnosed with cancer. 
I say to my colleagues, I appeal to you, don't get drawn into this debate that we should pass this legislation because we want to stand up and make a statement that we are against cloning. We are all against human cloning. We are all against human cloning. What I am asking you to do is to vote no on cloture so we will have an opportunity to hear from those patient groups that want to represent people like myself, represent families that have been affected like my family has been affected. Let us hear from the scientific community that tells us whether this is the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do. I don't make a suggestion here that this is an easy decision to be made. It is a very difficult one. But that's all the more reason that you should vote against cloture and allow the process to take place--to have input, to have discussion, to have understanding. Then we then will be in a position to try to make a decision about what is the right thing to do. We just say let the process work. Let there be input. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture and to support moving the process forward. 
I thank the distinguished Senator from California for yielding.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-mack-fl-2-19980205</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. MACK. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I want to begin my comments by making it clear, like I suspect everyone in the U.S. Senate, that I am against human cloning. I have not really found too many people who have come forward with a statement saying that they are for human cloning. I am opposed to human cloning. So, let me make that clear at the beginning of the discussion. But, there is much more to this debate than as to whether one is for or against human cloning, and I think it is important that we get beyond that. 
I agree with those who have indicated earlier in the day that, frankly, we need to delay this debate, we need to delay this legislation. You might say, `Well, why?' Certainly the individuals who engaged in producing the legislation are thoughtful, serious people. I do not question that, nor do I question their intentions. But what they have proposed I think has tremendous risks. 
I will read from just a couple of letters that I have received from Nobel laureates. One of the letters indicates--and this is from Dr. Paul Berg, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate, chemistry, 1980. In his letter he says:  
The bill sponsored by Senators Bond, Frist, Gregg and others, if passed, would be the first to ban a specific line of research. 
A specific line of research. Not the end result, but the specific line of research would not be permitted. 
And he goes on to say: 
I believe this is a serious mistake, one that we could regret because of its unintended implications for otherwise valuable biomedical research. 
He goes on in the letter to say: 
At the same time, any legislation should not impede or interfere with existing or potential critical research fundamental to the prevention or cure of human disease. 
In another letter, from J.M. Bishop, Nobel laureate, university professor, University of California, San Francisco: 
The fundamental flaw in this legislation is the prohibition of a technology irrespective of its application. Such prohibition forecloses on any benefit from the technology, even if that benefit were in no way objectionable. Many well-intentioned people fail to understand that somatic cell nuclear transfer is not limited to cloning an organism. There are many examples of possible future applications of this technology to produce healthy tissue for therapeutic purposes, such as skin grafts for burn patients, or even to create insulin-producing cells for diabetics. There may also be applications for cancer patients who need a bone marrow transplant for whom a match cannot be found. 
Mr. President, I suggest that if time had permitted and if there had been greater warning that this legislation was going to come to the floor, I could virtually fill up the Congressional Record with those individuals who have serious concerns about what this legislation would do. And the same group of people would make the statement they are opposed to human cloning. 
I must admit that I have more than just a casual interest in this legislation. I have been deeply involved in trying to understand basic research as it relates most specifically to finding cures and better treatments for cancer. I am terrified at the thought that this legislation could move forward without the opportunity for there to be in-depth scientific debate before committees of the Congress of the United States about what this legislation would do. 
I just say to people that, if you go back into the early 1970s, 1971, I believe, regarding the issue of recombinant DNA, there were horror stories that were told about recombinant DNA research. There were all kinds of fears that were created. And there were places in the country where bans were actually put into place. 
Well, fortunately, the Congress never passed a ban like 
they are talking about here, because if they had, just to use one disease--cystic fibrosis--think about what it would be like if you were the parent of a child with cystic fibrosis that had been denied a treatment that was developed as a result of going forward with recombinant DNA. 
What was developed enhanced the ability of the lung to function as a result of the discovery. Back in 1971, no one had even an idea where that research might have taken us. But in retrospect we can see that the foundation has been built for the future research that may in fact find better treatments, whether that is cancer, whether that is diabetes, whether that is Parkinson's disease, whether that is AIDS, whether that is sickle-cell anemia. And I could go on and on and on. 
So, Mr. President, all I am saying here today, and to my colleagues, is that if there is not a change in this legislation, then I am going to have to oppose the legislation. I understand that the majority leader will be coming to the floor shortly to file a cloture motion. I would have to vote against cloture if this legislation is not changed. I frankly believe that the most significant thing we could do would be to delay so that in fact we could hear from both sides on this issue. 
Again, the debate really isn't whether there should be human cloning. I think most people in this country clearly have said we should not do that, that it should be banned. But what we are debating is the potential outcome of the language that is put into legislative form that would limit the scientists of our country, limit them in their ability again to find cures, possibly, and certainly better treatments for the diseases that face our families, our children and our grandchildren. 
So, Mr. President, I sincerely hope that either we find some way to correct the legislation before us or that we delay this so that not only the scientific community can have an opportunity for input but also for patient groups. I think they ought to have an opportunity to come before the Congress at our hearings and let them raise their concerns about what might be done to maybe one area of hope that they have about better treatment or a cure.

Mr. MACK. 
Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to introduce with my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator Graham, the Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1998. This legislation will provide the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida with the judgeships which have been recommended for them by the Judicial Conference of the United States. The Middle District would receive three new permanent judgeships and one temporary judgeship (the highest number of new judgeships recommended for any district in the country), while the Southern District would receive two new permanent judgeships. 
I would not be introducing this bill if I did not believe there is a real need for increased judicial resources in Florida. The pressures upon our court system, particularly in the Middle District, are some of the most acute in the entire country. The Middle District currently contains 55% of Florida's population, projected to grow to two-thirds of the population by the year 2005; and yet this District has only one-third of Florida's judges. This District also contains the federal correctional center at Coleman. When construction of this facility is completed in FY 1999, it will be the largest prison complex in the country. The increased prisoner petitions which come with this will stretch judicial resources even further. 
To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been designated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased that Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against drugs, we must also recognize and anticipate the increased demands that this will put upon this district as more criminals are apprehended and prosecuted. 
Both districts contain major tourist attractions in frequently visited cities, including Disney World, Universal Studios, and Busch Gardens in Tampa and Orlando and the international playground of South Beach in Miami. This heavy flow of both tourism and winter residents serve to make the needs of these two judicial districts unique in our nation. 
The statistics kept by the Administrative Office of the US Courts demonstrate the compelling need for new judges in these districts. The numbers for the latest twelve month period show that the Middle District ranks second in the nation in average cases (adjusted for complexity) filed per judge, with a crushing 855. The Southern District averages 605 per judge. To put this in perspective, the national average for this time period was 519. Clearly, both of these districts are in need of relief. 
I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass this legislation expeditiously. I would also like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to Chairman Hatch for his swift consideration of all of the judicial nominees from Florida last year. The Southern and Middle Districts of Florida received three excellent new district judges, Donald Middlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold of Miami, and Richard Lazzara of Tampa. In addition, Judge Stanley Marcus was nominated to the federal appeals court and confirmed by the full Senate in only six weeks. I know I speak for both Senator Graham and myself in saying that we are grateful for Chairman Hatch's responsiveness to the needs of these districts. 
It will not be possible to provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to justice unless there is a court system in place which can handle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. This legislation is integral to providing that court system.

Mr. MACK. Thank you, Madam President. 
I thank the Senator from Georgia for this opportunity. I want to again commend the Senator for the leadership he provided last year in focusing us on this issue, leading the debate and the effort to try to pass the A-plus education savings account with great leadership. We appreciate what the Senator is doing. 
I want to kind of set the stage as to why I think the issue of education is so important. When I go home and speak to the people, they will tell you that the No. 1 issue facing the Nation, facing their State, facing their community, is education. I think they recognize that if their children are going to be successful with their lives, they have to have an education that is second to none. 
But let me put it in a broader perspective in that I believe that the 21st century is going to be the century of knowledge. 
We have all heard about, for the last 10 or 15 years, folks like Alvin Toffler talking about the information/communications age. Some of us find ourselves totally surprised that we are engaged in playing around on the computer, the Internet, things I couldn't have dreamed of a couple years ago. We know there is an explosion of knowledge and information out there. We also know that if our children are going to be successful and be able to compete in the 21st century, they are going to have to have an education second to none. 
To just build on that, there was an educator in the State of Florida--President Bush put him on his commission-- Mitch Madique, who is the president at one of our State universities. He traveled to South America and had discussions with the various leaders of education in those countries. They were saying to him, `We are really looking forward to the 21st century because competition in the 21st century is no longer going to be based on military capability, military strength or the amount of your natural resources. Instead, competition is going to be based on knowledge. If that's the case, we're all starting off on the same foot. And we believe we have just as much of an opportunity to develop a first-class education system as you do. So we look forward to competition in the 21st century.' 
To me, this means that if those three little grandsons of mine, who are 13, 11 and 4, if they are going to have an opportunity to make it, and if they are going to have an opportunity to have the same kind of experiences and opportunities that we had, then they do have to have an education that is second to none. 
The proposals that the Senator from Georgia has already laid out make clear that there is not going to be a solution described and defined at the Federal level and passed on to the local communities and States. Conversely, we believe that the answers are going to come from the grassroots level. 
So I would like to just share for a moment an experience that I had in California a few years ago. I went to a school in the area where the riots took place. The name of this school was the Marcus Garvey School. We have had some experience with the Marcus 
Garvey School here in Washington. The experience we had in California was totally different than here locally, so don't be confused. 
As I went to the school and I drove down the street, I would suggest that probably most of you would think, `I'm not sending my child to that school.' There were just absolutely no amenities. There was not a blade of grass anywhere. There was not a single basketball hoop or any playgrounds that I could see. There was just a building that had been converted, I am not sure what from, into a series of classrooms. 
We went in and we met with the owner, the administrator, the principal--all one person. His name was Anyim Palmer. His office was probably 10 by 12, stacked full of papers. He had no secretary. When the phone rang, he answered it. The equipment or the desks and chairs appeared to be 30-40 years old. The point I am making is there was not a lot of money invested in amenities in this school. 
He suggested that maybe we go down and work our way through the different classes that were being taught. We started out in the day care area. We saw about eight or nine children age 2--not second grade, but age 2. When my wife and I went down to the room, the teacher said to the children, `Show the Senator and Mrs. Mack how you can say your ABCs'--again, they were 2 years old. They said their ABCs. Just as cute as they could be, they ran through the alphabet. When they finished with that, the teacher said, `Now say it in Spanish.' Then they said it in Spanish. Then she said, `Do it in Swahili.' Then they said it in Swahili. Here are 2-year-old children who have already mastered the alphabet in three different languages. 
We went from there over to where the 3-year-old children--again, I emphasize 3-year-old children--were working on math. These little children were walking up to the blackboard working through math problems. So the teacher said to me, `Give them a problem to work on.' I suspect everybody here would have reacted the same way I did. I said, `How about 5 plus 3?' She said, `No. I mean, give them a difficult problem to do.' So I said, `Well, how about 153 plus 385.' And the little 3-year-old stood there and put a couple dots on the board, wrote down one number; put a couple more dots on the board, and another number went down; a few more dots, another number went down. It was the right answer--3 years old. 
We went over where the 4-year-olds were being taught reading, and they were reading at the second and third grade levels--at the age of 4. 
I went to where the 5-year-old children were--and mind you, we have not gotten to the first grade yet. The teacher asked one of the little boys to stand up and recite for me, in the proper chronological order, all the Presidents of the United States. This little boy stood up and looked me right square in the eye, and he listed every President of the United States in proper chronological order. 
You might be asking yourself, how did I know that? Frankly, they handed me a cheat sheet, and I was working my way down it as he was going through it. 
My point is, here is a school that most people, again, would look at and say, `I don't want my child to go there.' No amenities. It is bare bones. You may say, `Well, what makes this thing work?', which is exactly what I asked every teacher in every room that we went into. How is this happening? Anyim Palmer told me that the answer was the teacher. It is the teacher. Every time they asked the question, the answer was the same--it is the teacher. 
Interesting things came out of it. I don't believe any of the teachers were certified. I think only two of them had college educations. What happened is Anyim Palmer, who was the owner, administrator, the principal, was a former public schoolteacher who became so frustrated with the public school system that he said, `I'm going to start my own school. I'm going to teach people how 
to teach.' 
Again, I would encourage anyone who has an opportunity to make a visit to that school or something like it to do so. But the point is, if we rely on the present system, the present system will produce exactly what it has produced in the past, unless there is something that forces people to change. We believe the program that we have put together will in fact assist local communities and States to develop alternatives to the present public school system. 
I visited a charter school in Miami just a few days ago and spoke with a teacher there, who up until a few years ago was an engineer. I said, `What happened? Why are you teaching?' He said two things. One is, he said, `I lost my job. And I didn't want to put my family through that kind of an experience again. I felt there was some security in teaching.' And then he said, `You know what? I have found my calling.' He is teaching second grade children. He said, `This is exactly where I should be.' 
But in this charter school, this individual had flexibility. This individual could approach the opportunity of teaching our children in a totally different way than in the past. So, again, I think if we encourage innovative thinking, we are going to find there are some remarkable ways to improve education in our country. 
As you know, one of the major points in our proposal is to reward teachers who do a good job. We ought to reward excellence. We ought to say to those teachers, `You have done a great job and we are going to reward you for it.' That is why we are talking about the importance of merit pay. 
But if we are going to have merit pay, we also need to recognize those teachers who are not doing a good job. We need a way to determine that, other than whether a principal likes an individual or does not like an individual, or a school board does not like an individual. We ought to say there ought to be competence testing. Part of this plan, known as BOOKS, calls for competency testing and for merit pay. 
Before I conclude, I would like to point out that in the State of Florida, 70 percent of the community college freshmen require remedial education. We have to change that. The cost to the State of Florida is $50 billion a year to handle this problem. Let's improve our K-12 education system. 
With that, I yield the floor and again thank the Senator from Georgia for tackling this initiative. I look forward to working with you on this important issue.

Mr. MACK. I could suspect you could draw the conclusion they were somewhat different than, say, what most people think of as the traditional family in America. But I would be careful about drawing too many conclusions on that because I think there are some things about what was going on in this school that also sends a message to moms and dads. 
I think that one of the reasons for success was because mom and dad were involved. They made the determination. I mean, this was a private school, so they have to pay to go to that private school--some of them at great sacrifice. Some of them, frankly, from outside the community. 
But the point there is, if you go back to the charter school, for example, one of the things that most charter schools require, as you know, is that they want parent involvement. In fact, when I was at the school in Liberty City, in Miami, mom and dad parents came into the classroom, as I was talking with the teacher, to discuss with him the problems of their student. What was the problem? Or what should they be doing more at home to help? 
Again, I think one of the messages that we do get is that in the charter schools--I guess there are others who are much more knowledgeable at these things than I am, but because it is a very focused school, it understands the importance of mom and dad being engaged. The teacher understands the importance of moms and dads being engaged, and, clearly, the parents understand if they are going to be able to keep their children in this charter school, they have to be part of it. 
Again, I would make the case, whether it be a mother and a dad or single mom or single father, that if you can engage them in the education process, regardless of that background, in probably 9 out of 10 cases--I am just saying this from my feeling; I do not have the statistics--but 9 out of 10 times, if you, the parent, one or both, are engaged in your children's education, you are going to improve the ability of your child to learn. And, again, I think you are going to find that you are going to create that environment, something different than we are doing today. 
There is just so much we can learn from this experience. Again, the answer that kept coming back, `It is the teacher. It is the teacher. It is the teacher.' I think people ought to recognize that what Republicans are saying is we value teachers. They are the ones who really make a difference. 
Again, if my grandsons are going to succeed, they need to be exposed to good teachers. We have to help create an environment in which people, (a) want to come into the teaching profession and, (b) once they are there, want to remain and experience the excitement of seeing young children learn. Teachers help children realize how important knowledge is to them and their future. Again, teachers are the ones who really make a difference.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to address a matter regarding the refinancing of section 8 assisted properties whose bonds are financed with a financial adjustment factor [FAF]. In order to save section 8 housing assistance payment funds, the Congress through the enactment of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act encouraged owners of FAF properties to refund their bonds with lower interest rates. The recaptured section 8 savings were equally shared between the bond issuing housing agency and HUD and the housing agencies were required to use their share of the savings for affordable housing purposes. In the recently enacted VA, HUD appropriations legislation, a provision was included to encourage owners to refinance their properties by providing the owners a 15-percent share of the savings. 
It has come to my attention that there may be some question as to whether the fiscal year 1998 VA, HUD appropriations act would allow an owner or an issuer to refinance a FAF property which was previously refinanced. We reviewed this matter while developing the amendments to this version of S. 562. However, upon review of the appropriations language, it appears unnecessary to include statutory language to clarify this matter. I would like to ask Senator Bond, the chairman of the VA, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, if he could confirm my interpretation of this issue.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Harkin, DeWine, Santorum, Collins, Snowe, D'Amato, Smith of Oregon, Boxer, Kennedy, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Graham, Dodd, Durbin, and Wellstone in introducing legislation that begins to realize the paramount goal of doubling funding for the National Institutes of Health [NIH] over the next 5 years. The bill ensures that any tobacco settlements or judgments are not tax deductible. 
As currently crafted, the global settlement specifically allows the tobacco companies to deduct the entire amount of their payments. That is a possible $128 billion break on their tax bill. I believe it is fundamentally wrong to allow them such a free ride at taxpayers' expense. More importantly, any settlement should provide funds for biomedical research, including funding to find better treatment and cures for the diseases caused by tobacco. 
Although the Tax Code often allows settlement amounts to be deductible, the current law provides that fines or penalties paid to a Government entity are not. The unprecedented situation we face with the tobacco industry demands that the Congress define these payments as more akin to such a fine or penalty. If a businessman cannot deduct a speeding ticket he received on his way to a meeting, tobacco shouldn't be able to deduct its payment for guaranteed immunity and certainty of liability. Which is worse, a speeding ticket or knowingly addicting and killing millions of Americans? 
I want my colleagues to understand that the success of our efforts on this front does not hinge on the enactment of a final Federal settlement. The bill applies to any settlement or judgment at the State or Federal level. As such, if the tobacco companies are found liable in any forum, or see fit to settle any of their cases with governmental entities, those payments will not be deductible. However, the bill leaves in place the deductibility of compensatory sums paid to individuals for harm done to them. Now is the time for Congress to step forward and pledge that we will not be a party to any tobacco settlement that comes at taxpayers' expense. 
Allowing the companies to state that they are willing to pay $368.5 billion to the Government, when in reality they are only paying two-thirds of that amount, is false advertising. The bill corrects this misleading situation to the benefit of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans whose tobacco-related illnesses might be cured now through medical research. 
As my colleagues will recall, the Senate passed by a vote of 98 to 0 a Sense of the Senate Resolution that Congress, and the Nation, should commit to the goal of doubling funding for NIH over the next 5 years. The actions we are taking today will help us to achieve that goal. 
The tax revenues which will be derived as a result of making the settlement or judgments nondeductible will be used to establish the National Trust Fund for Biomedical Research. Each year, after the President has signed the Labor/HHS/Education bill into law, the moneys in the medical research trust fund established by this bipartisan legislation will be allocated to NIH for biomedical research. 
Research has demonstrated that many diseases can be prevented, eliminated, detected earlier, or managed more effectively through a vast array of new medical procedures and therapies. 
For the first time in history, overall death rates from cancer have begun a steady decline in the United States. Ten years ago, cancer patients were offered little hope of survival. Today, however, if a breast cancer is detected at an early stage, there is a 94-percent survival rate. Today, 80 percent of children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] are alive and free of the disease 5 years after diagnosis. 
Genetic research has enabled Americans to learn if they are more likely to develop osteoporosis, breast cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease and other illnesses. Scientists now know that, in at least 50 percent, and possibly as many as 80 percent, of all cancers, one gene--p53--is damaged. If cancer cells growing in a dish are given healthy p53 genes, they immediately stop proliferating and die. 
We now know that if one inherits a mutated gene for hemochromatosis, more commonly known as iron overload disease, a disease which affects approximately 1 million Americans, then one will actually develop the disease. The benefit of knowing this is that giving blood is an effective way to manage the disease. 
Because of the advances made in biomedical research, people with Parkinson's disease, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and other ailments are living longer and healthier lives. We are on the verge of cures and new treatments for diseases which have plagued our society for many years. Research is the key which will unlock the knowledge needed to find these cures. 
But doubling our commitment to NIH, we could improve the grant success rate from 25 to 40 percent. More patients would have access to clinical trials. Approximately 2 percent of all cancer patients are now enrolled in clinical trials. We could increase that to 20 percent. The result is that more families would have access to the most effective state-of-the-art treatment. 
Patients would also benefit by advances in new methods of treatment including gene therapy, immunotherapy, spinal cord rejuvenation; helping diabetics naturally produce insulin; relief for Parkinson's disease patients, and reduction in heart disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States. 
We have entered a new era of medical research in this country, but we must provide the necessary funding in order to translate discoveries into new methods of diagnosis and treatment. 
There can be little argument that scientific advances will also have a significant positive impact upon our Nation's economy. They will result in reduced health expenditures for Medicare, Medicaid, DOD, VA, and other public and private health programs. A recent study by the National Science Foundation concluded that every dollar spent on basic research permanently adds 50 cents or more each year to national output. 
In addition, the medical technology industry provides high-wage jobs to millions of Americans. Investment in basic science helps the United States compete in the global marketplace in such industries as pharmacology, biotechnology, and medical technology. Combined with the actions taken earlier this year to reform the FDA, public and private investment in biomedical research will ensure our ability to compete in this important industry and create new jobs. 
Mr. President, there are millions of Americans who are fighting a day-to-day battle against cancer, sickle cell anemia, AIDS, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, and other ailments. Their lives are in our hands. They are asking for hope and the opportunity for a cure. We must act now.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the Senate is honored today to have Dr. Charles Lever with us. Dr. Lever is the senior minister at the Lake Magdalene United Methodist Church in Tampa in my home State of Florida. We are also happy to have his wife, Xiommy, who works as a hematopoeitic product specialist at Ortho Biotech and is also active in the church as a certified lay speaker and is involved in Disciple Bible Study and the Walk to Emmaus. They have two sons--Chaz who is in the seventh grade, and Chapman, who is in the first grade. 
Dr. Lever was called to the ordained ministry as a young man. He began his education at Wofford College in South Carolina, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree. He earned a master of divinity from the Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, and a doctor of ministry from Vanderbilt University in Nashville. He has also done continuing education work at the Jerusalem Center for Church Studies in Israel, and the Robert Schuller Institute in Garden Grove, CA. 
Among his many educational and leadership awards and honors are the American Legion Award, induction into Phi Beta Kappa, Blue Key, and numerous other honorary fraternities and societies. 
Mr. President, with some 3,200 members, Lake Magdalene Methodist is one of the largest churches in Florida. But Dr. Lever's accomplishments have always extended far beyond the santuary of his church. He is a leader in numerous organizations serving the people in his local community. Among these are the 90-unit apartment complex for the elderly, 125-unit child care center for low-income families, and the Life Center for older adults that he served as minister at the Riverside Park United Methodist Church of Jacksonville, FL. 
He is active in both district and conference affairs of the United Methodist Church in Florida. He has served on the board of the Christian Enrichment School, the district committee on finance, and the Conference Council on Ministries.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent resolution on the Clinton-Jiang United States-People's Republic of China summit with my colleagues Senators Abraham, Nickles, and Craig. I am compelled to do this for two reasons. 
First, let me provide some context for my comments. I traveled to China this past March to address Hong Kong reversion issues, and returned concerned about United States-China relations. My concern grew from what I perceived as the distance between the shared humanity of American and Chinese people, and the distrust of people expressed by the autocratic Government of the People's Republic of China. 
My two issues with this summit are these: 
First, we know what President Jiang gets from this visit; we do not know what President Clinton will receive in return for the American people. 
Second, unfortunately, it seems that the bar has been lowered--the administration has lowered expectations for the summit--in order to more easily achieve the appearance of a successful summit. If the United States abandons realistic and important summit deliverables until a possible 1998 Clinton visit to Beijing, United States values today will be sacrificed for political gain tomorrow. 
Let me elaborate on these points. What does Jiang get? He gets more power in Beijing. 
He is the leader of the largest authoritarian government in the world. His top priority, as a Communist leader, is consolidation of power and longevity in office. 
His overriding goal for the summit, therefore, is to demonstrate that he can deal effectively with the United States. He wants to bring home symbolic proof that the United States views the People's Republic of China, with Jiang at the helm, as a respected global power. 
This state visit will deliver the symbolism President Jiang so strongly seeks. 
What do we get? We do not yet know because there is not an articulated United States-China policy. 
President Clinton has no articulated China policy and will not likely produce one during this summit. This may be the single most dangerous aspect of our relationship with China. 
President Clinton this week must deliver a milestone in a clearly articulated policy which supports a coherent and well defined strategy. And he must bring the Congress and American people with him. 
To do this, he should attain specific deliverables on human rights, weapons proliferation, and trade. 
Therefore, Mr President, today we are introducing this resolution to articulate our specific expectations. During this summit, the United States should do the following: State United States support for the democratization of China; call for progress on human rights, and the immediate release of prisoners of conscience, including Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan; call for concrete steps to prevent the proliferation of weapons and weapons technology, including nuclear technology and cruise missiles; call for concrete progress to cease unfair market practices; state United States commitment to maintaining regional peace and security by working with our regional allies; and reaffirm United States policy promulgated in the Taiwan Relations Act. 
Mr President, I hope that President Clinton will not lose this opportunity to gain concrete progress on the vitally important United States-China relationship. 
If we solidify Jiang's hold on political power in Beijing, and in return must wait until a possible Beijing summit next year before the American people get what they desire--trade, human rights, and national security progress--the failure of the summit will not be lost on the Congress or the American people. 
Nonaction represents an opportunity cost, Mr. President. My question to President Clinton is this, `What price would you have the people of the United States and China pay for this week's headlines.'

Mr. MACK. I agree with Senator Sarbanes that this flexibility is extremely important in dealing with disqualified properties and that with input from local governments, communities, and residents, hopefully some creativity can be used. I strongly believe that it is important that the Federal Government terminate its relationship with those owners who have abused the program and those properties where it is simply infeasible to continue to subsidize. However, we should not take a `one-size-fits-all' approach and ensure that the interests of residents, communities, and local governments are carefully considered. 
I am also concerned about those properties, not eligible for mark-to-market, whose contracts are not renewed due to noncompliance actions by owners or the poor physical condition of the property. I have some reservations about HUD's policy to simply voucher out those properties instead of exploring other creative options such as transfers or sales to resident-supported nonprofit entities.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, under the `mark-to-market' title that is contained in the VA-HUD appropriations conference report, a strong priority to public entities is provided to act as participating administrative entities [PAE]. It is expected that qualified public entities will handle most of the work under this program. However, in instances where a qualified public entity is not available, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] is provided flexibility in selecting other qualified entities such as nonprofit and for-profit entities. 
To ensure that these entities do not use their positions as PAE's for unfair financial benefit, the bill contains an important provision that would prevent conflicts of interests by PAE's. It is my understanding that this provision was included to permit the Secretary to establish guidelines that would prevent conflicts of interest by a PAE that provides financing or credit enhancement as part of the restructuring process. Further, the provision allows the Secretary to establish guidelines to deal with other conflicts of interest issues that would prevent PAE's, especially nonprofit and for-profit private entities, from using their roles as PAE's in the restructuring program that go beyond the public purposes outlined in the legislation. 
I would like to ask Senator Bond if this is also his understanding of the bill.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond, for crafting a measure that carefully balances a wide range of competing and diverse interests. I believe this conference report deserves the strong support of all Senators. 
I am especially pleased that this bill contains legislation I introduced, along with Senators D'Amato, Bond, and Bennett, and cosponsored by Senators Domenici, Chafee, Faircloth and Grams, to reform the Nation's assisted and insured multifamily housing portfolio. It is unusual to have extensive authorizing language in an appropriation. However, title V of this bill, the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act, balances both fiscal and public policy goals. It will save scarce Federal resources over both the short and long term while preserving the affordability and availability of decent and safe rental housing for lower income households. 
About 20 years ago, the Federal Government encouraged private developers to construct affordable rental housing by providing mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and rental housing assistance through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [HUD] project-based section 8 program. In addition, tax incentives for the development of low-income housing were provided through the tax code until 1986. 
HUD's section 8 assisted and FHA-insured multifamily housing program has created thousands of decent, safe and affordable housing properties. However, the current program allows some owners to receive more--often far more Federal dollars than necessary to maintain their properties. Further, a portion of the rental stock suffers from poor management or has become physically distressed. Thus, in some cases, taxpayers are paying costly subsidies for inferior housing. 
We are on the verge of a funding crisis in the renewal of HUD's expiring section 8 rental assistance contracts. Indeed, HUD Secretary Cuomo has called the section 8 contract renewal problem `the greatest crisis HUD has ever faced.' Over the next several years, a majority of the section 8 contracts on the 8,500 FHA-insured properties will expire. If contracts continue to be renewed at existing levels, the cost of renewing these contracts will grow from about $2 billion in fiscal year 1998 to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 and more than $7.7 billion 10 years from now. The total cost of renewing all section 8 project-based and tenant-based assistance would grow from $9 billion in fiscal year 1998 to as much as $18 billion in fiscal year 2002 without policy changes. 
Federally assisted and insured housing serves almost 1.6 million families with an average annual income of $7,000. About half of the households are elderly or contain persons with disabilities. Many of these developments are located in rural areas where no other rental housing exists. Some of these properties serve as anchors of neighborhoods where the economic stability of the neighborhood is dependent on the vitality of these properties. If the project-based contracts are not renewed, residents and communities would be adversely affected. Further, most of the underlying FHA-insured mortgages--with an unpaid principal balance of $18 billion--will be forced into default. 
The Banking Committee began its examination of what is commonly referred to as the `mark-to-market' issue more than 2 years ago. Since that time, we have received extensive input from all of the potential stakeholders in this issue, including residents, project managers, low-income advocates and project residents, State and local interests, the financial community, and HUD. 
The version of the bill we are considering today reflects negotiations with all parties that have occurred since its original introduction as S. 513 in March. It is a consensus bill that helps to ensure that residents, communities and the Federal investment in the housing are protected at a cost we can afford. 
At a Housing Subcommittee hearing in June, HUD Secretary Cuomo raised some administration concerns about S. 513. We have attempted to address those concerns and provide a reasonable degree of flexibility for HUD in its overall administration of the mortgage restructuring program and also to provide reasonable opportunities for the use of tenant-based assistance after restructuring. I appreciate the cooperation of Secretary Cuomo in helping to move this important legislation forward. 
I want to thank Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Banking Committee, for his ongoing, strong support for this legislation. In addition, I appreciate the support of Senators Sarbanes and Kerry. From the outset, mark-to-market has been a bipartisan effort, and those Senators have made invaluable contributions to the final version of the legislation. 
I want to touch briefly on some of the bill's major provisions and the compromises that are reflected in the conference agreement. 
First, the bill `marks' rents on oversubsidized properties to comparable market rents or to 90 percent of area fair market rents. The underlying mortgages would be restructured so they could be supported by the new rents. In some cases, higher rents could be permitted if necessary to support proper operations and maintenance costs. These exceptions are principally intended to assure the continued viability of projects, generally serving the elderly, located in rural areas. 
Second, the bill also recognizes that HUD lacks the staffing capacity and expertise to oversee effectively its portfolio of multifamily housing properties or to administer a debt restructuring program. Accordingly, the bill would transfer the functions and responsibilities of the restructuring program to capable third parties, preferably State and local housing finance agencies, who would act as participating administrative entities [PAE's] in managing this program. 
The language concerning third parties has been modified from its original form partially in order to accommodate concerns raised by the administration. These changes will increase HUD's flexibility to partner with a variety of public, nonprofit, and for-profit entities that have expertise in affordable housing, while also providing an exclusive time period for applications submitted by publicly accountable entities. 
Under the revised language, public entities--State and local housing finance agencies [HFA's]--would be given an exclusive time period to submit proposals to serve as PAE's. Criteria for the selection of PAE's would be based on the applicant's demonstrated experience and expertise in multifamily financing and restructuring and the capacity to work with low-income residents and communities. Further, selection would be based on the PAE's ability to perform the portfolio restructuring in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. I would like to emphasize that the Secretary would be required to select housing finance agencies as PAE's if they meet the selection criteria. 
I strongly believe that, based on the housing finance agencies' track records and mission that they are by far the most viable entities to carry out the responsibilities under this program and to balance the financial and social policy goals of the bill. Accordingly, it is my expectation that State and local HFA's would be responsible for most of the properties under mark-to-market, as evident by the significant participation of public entities under HUD's fiscal 1997 mark-to-market demonstration program. 
Third, owners who clearly violate housing quality standards would no longer be tolerated. The bill screens out bad owners and managers and nonviable projects from the inventory and provides tougher and more effective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of FHA insurance and assisted housing programs. 
Fourth, the conference bill revises the original version of S. 513, which had called for the exclusive use of project-based rental assistance after restructuring. Under the conference agreement, project-based assistance would be maintained on properties located in markets where there is inadequate available affordable housing and for those that predominantly serve elderly or disabled populations. For the remaining inventory, PAE's would be provided the discretion of either maintaining project-based assistance or providing tenant-based assistance. The PAE's decision on the form of assistance would be based on factors related to the local market, the stability of the project, resident choice, and the impact on the community. This decision would only be made after consultation with affected owners and appropriate public officials, and significant participation by affected residents. 
Fifth, the conference agreement establishes a new Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance Restructuring, headed by a Presidentially appointed Director, within HUD to oversee the restructuring process. The bill makes it clear that the Director will be answerable and be accountable to the Secretary, but will free of undue Secretarial interference in the conduct and decisionmaking of the office. 
Last, the bill provides tools to recapitalize the assisted stock that suffers from deferred maintenance. It provides the opportunity for tenants, local governments and the community in which the project is located to participate in the restructuring process in a meaningful way. Residents would also be empowered through opportunities to purchase properties. 
Mr. President, I would like to emphasize how important it is that we are addressing this issue this year. Delays will only harm the assisted housing stock, its residents and communities, and the financial stability of the FHA insurance funds. I would add that, as we face an explosion in the cost of section 8 contract renewals, we cannot afford to pay more than is reasonable to renew expiring contracts. 
This legislation will protect the Federal Government's investment in assisted housing and ensure that participating administrative entities are held accountable for their activities. It is also our goal that this process will ensure the long-term viability of these projects with minimal Federal involvement. It is a sincere effort to reduce the cost to the Federal Government while recognizing the needs of low-income families and communities throughout the Nation. 
In closing, I want to commend Senator Bond and his counterpart in the House, Congressman Jerry Lewis, for their cooperation in acting to avert a potential section 8 contract renewal crisis. This is a bipartisan proposal that both reduces unnecessary Federal expenditures and represents good and thoughtful Federal housing policy.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the key issue in this debate is a simple one: Will we enforce the campaign laws already on the books or not? Will we concoct some new layer of confusing and complex rules and regulations to distract the voters from the real issue, or will we do the right thing? Are we going to insist that campaigns and candidates follow the current rules, or are we going to keep changing the laws each time there is a new scandal? If we can't--or won't--even enforce the laws we have now, what makes us think that a new set of laws will be more effective? 
The Senate and the American people have witnessed a flood of testimony in recent weeks and months about illegal foreign contributions, influence peddling, and money laundering at the highest levels of our Government. The Attorney General has finally called for an investigation in the face of mounting evidence that, to many of us, clearly warranted a special investigator months ago. 
Now, here we are debating a bill on the floor of the Senate that will not only add new regulations and restrictions to the people's ability to participate in the election of their own representatives, but which ignores the violations of campaign laws that apparently have already taken place. 
How does that play with the American people? I doubt it goes over too well. Sure, Americans are distrustful of all the money in campaigns. They are right to be suspicious when they read about Buddhist nuns being used to funnel foreign money into a Presidential campaign or the Lincoln bedroom being used to cozy up with big-money campaign contributors. 
And they are also right to be dubious of what is going on here, because I think they understand and we are not tackling the real issue at hand. We are trying to divert their attention away from the simple fact that our campaign laws are not being enforced. This is the kind of cynicism that justifies the American people's distrust and apathy toward Washington politicians. 
History teaches us that when any law is not enforced, whether campaign law or any other law, the people lose confidence in the system, whether it is the criminal justice system or the electoral system. When violations of the law go uninvestigated and unpunished, we send the message that the law doesn't matter. We destroy one of the core principles of our government--that we are a nation of laws, not of men--and the law applies equally to everyone--not just to some and not others. 
We aren't doing anything to restore the American people's confidence in their Government until we begin to deal with this fundamental issue: Do the current campaign laws matter enough to be enforced or are they just an arbitrary system that can be followed or ignored depending on what is convenient for a campaign? The answer to this question must be emphatic--the laws that are here to protect our political system must be enforced vigorously. Nothing less is acceptable. 
Mr. President, there is a second reason the voters are dubious about our seriousness for cleaning up campaign finance violations. Many of these voters are angry that their hard-earned money goes to candidates they don't agree with. This happens through what essentially is extortion by the unions. Many hard-working union workers have part of their paycheck sent to political campaigns they don't support. 
Yes, by codifying the Beck decision, this bill tries to make sure that non-union members don't have their paychecks extorted for political use. But union members are left in a position of having to choose between their job or their first amendment right to support the candidate of their choice. With more and more union members voting Republican in recent years, it's no wonder that the liberal union bosses are working to make sure this form of political blackmail is protected. 
Some will say this is no different than PAC's using their money to support candidates that a contributor may not agree with. Well if the Sierra Club or the National Rifle Association or any other similar group uses your money to support a candidate you disagree with, you can stop giving your money to that group and its PAC. It's a voluntary choice. But that's not possible in a union--at least not without putting your job at risk. 
No, Mr. President, this effort does nothing to fix what's broken. There are all sorts of schemes to make television stations give candidates free air time, and to regulate what can and can't be said in political commercials. And there are even provisions that would have the Federal Government establishing State and local campaign restrictions. All of this adds up to putting chains around our fundamental first amendment rights. 
The courts have repeatedly held that communications which do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate are not subject to regulation by the Government. But the proponents of this bill would make the Federal Election Commission into the politics police. They would determine whether a reasonable person would know that an ad is advocating the election or defeat of a candidate or not. This would send a chill through our political process. Now the Government would decide what is reasonable or not. It is exactly the kind of temptation to tyranny that the Founding Fathers were protecting the American people from when they adopted the first amendment. 
Supporters of this bill contend there is too much money in politics. What they're saying is, they think there's too much free speech, too much involvement by free people expressing their views. But isn't that exactly what we want--more involvement and more participation? More candidates are running for office now than ever. Voters now have more options than ever. Placing further limits on speech will effectively drive more citizens from the process. 
We should stop this misguided effort and do what the American people really want--and that is to enforce the laws that have been on the books for years. Only by doing so will we restore their confidence in the political and electoral system that is supposed to send us here to do their bidding. 
Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make enforcing our current laws the No. 1 priority and put aside this effort to construct yet another monstrosity of bureaucracy and complexity that will add to American's skepticism of Washington.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this amendment was offered last Thursday. We still have not had one Member come to the floor to speak in opposition to it. It has received support from both sides of the aisle and is supported by Senator Abraham, the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee. It has received positive editorial support from a wide array of newspapers, including the Washington Times and the New York Times. It has also received the endorsement of Empire America. Yesterday I introduced into the Record a letter of support from Jeanne Kirkpatrick, Jack Kemp, William Bennett, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes. 
This is a narrowly targeted amendment which merely ensures that Central Americans receive the due process which they were originally promised. It is focused on an identifiable group of people and ensures their opportunity to apply for suspension of deportation. It is not a grant of immunity. 
I have not been able to obtain an up-or-down vote on my amendment, so I will be moving to table my own amendment. I will oppose the motion to table, and ask for the support of my colleagues in opposing the motion to table. 
So, Mr. President, I therefore move to table amendment No. 1253. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

<TEXT>
Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered simply clarifies the implementation of last year's immigration legislation in one specific area, the suspension of deportation. Last year's bill imposed stricter standards to obtain suspension of deportation. While this is fine for future applicants, it is unfair to impose new, harsher standards on cases which were already in the pipeline at the time of passage. 
This amendment does two specific things: first of all, it clarifies that certain Central American immigrants who were in the administrative pipeline for suspension of deportation must continue to meet the standards that applied before the immigration reform law took effect. Second, the annual cap on suspensions of deportation would only apply to cases commenced after April 1, 1997. 
Without those two changes, we will be changing the rules midstream for a group of people who were attempting to comply with the guidelines for regularizing their immigration status. We encouraged them to come forward and play by the rules and we cannot go back on our word now. 
As a way of background, let me lay out some information for the Senate. Starting in the mid-1980's, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans fleeing the civil wars in their home countries started coming to the United States. Many of them made asylum claims, many of which were improperly denied as the U.S. Government acknowledged by ordering them readjudicated. In the case of Nicaraguans, this was done through the Nicaraguan review program established by Ronald Reagan. And in the case of Salvadorans and Guatemalans this was done through settlement of the ABC class lawsuit agreed to by the Bush administration. 
A huge backlog of asylum claims, however, then prevented their cases from being reheard for many years. Meanwhile, various temporary statuses allowed the members of this group to avoid deportation. In addition, they received authorization to work legally in the United States. During that time many members of that group established strong roots in this country. 
Under immigration law, there has long been available a procedure called `suspension of deportation' for an individual found to be of good character and who has been here for 7 years to adjust to legal status if deporting that individual would cause `extreme hardship' to the person or his or her immediate legal present relative. This requires a case-by-case adjudication that the person being granted this benefit meets the legal standard. Because of the asylum backlog and because conditions in the individual's home country had changed since the filing of their original asylum claims, the Department of Justice under President Clinton encouraged these central Americans to seek suspension of deportation rather than continuing to press their asylum claims or file a new lawsuit. 
Again, the point that I am trying to make here in laying out this history is that each step along the way this group of individuals has complied with the rules that existed at the time. In fact, we went to the extent that we encouraged these people to file for suspension of deportation, and it would just be fundamentally unfair at this point if we were to change the rules on these people who in fact have been trying to live by 
the rules every day that they have been here. 
Several other points. The reason why we believe this is important is because we believe that this in essence will deny these people the right to due process under laws with respect to suspension of deportation. 
I want to emphasize to my colleagues that this is not amnesty, and there is nothing automatic here. Let us assume for a moment that this amendment were to pass. We are not guaranteeing anybody anything other than the fact that they will have to comply with the rules as they existed at the time they came into the process of suspension of deportation. 
Again, I want to emphasize to my colleagues that this is not amnesty. Every person affected by my amendment is merely being given a chance for due process, to have their case heard. They must still meet the criteria to be granted suspension of deportation. In addition, my amendment is focused only upon an identifiable group. There are those who want to create the impression that if this amendment passes literally millions of people, millions of illegal immigrants will use this as a loophole to remain in the country. This is an extremely identifiable group. And, again, working with the INS, we have concluded that there are probably in the neighborhood of 316,000 individuals that would be included in the group, and of that 316,000 it is likely that 150,000 will receive suspension of deportation. 
Again, I make the point that we ought to pass this amendment from the perspective of fairness. We should not change the rules midstream for this group of people. It is unfair and, I would make the claim, un-American. 
On a personal note, from time to time, I have been asked why I became involved in this issue, and I will tell you that one of the memories that comes back to me is a trip to Nicaragua back in the 1980's where I went to a contra camp, and this was at a particular period of time where the concern was whether the United States was going to continue to provide assistance to those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua. And since they did not have the commitment to those financial resources, thousands of these freedom fighters came back into the camps in northern Nicaragua. I visited them. It was quite a scene--I must say, too, a very emotional scene. 
As the helicopter landed, off to the side of the camp two lines were formed, in essence two lines of men in fatigues at attention. As we walked through this group of individuals, where roughly 7,000 to 8,000 freedom fighters were standing at attention, 
three men, three of the soldiers, with guitars played the Nicaraguan national anthem. It was a tremendously emotional period. In essence I said to them that we will not abandon you, that we will continue to support you in your fight for freedom. 
I would make the case that fighting for freedom is not just providing resources to those engaged in battle, or fighting for freedom is not simply standing firm in the U.S. Senate for a strong national defense. But standing firm for the protection of individual rights is, in fact, standing up for freedom. And I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. 
We have encouraged those people over years, not only in their fight for freedom, but afterward, telling them that if they played by the rules they could stay in this country. 
Mr. President, again, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the right thing to do. It is a fair thing to do. And it would be in the best interests of our country to continue to stand up for freedom for this group of people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Abraham not only for his eloquent statement but also his understanding of the matter of why we have ended up in this situation of having to deal with this issue on an appropriations bill. Again, I appreciate both your effort and your staff's effort over this last week or 10 days to try to keep making the effort to see if there was some way we could come to some agreement that would not have to put the Senate through this debate. So again, your counsel was invaluable, and I appreciate your presence on the floor as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration of the Judiciary Committee. It is very meaningful to have your support, and we thank you very much. 
Just a couple of other comments, Mr. President. I wanted to indicate some of those who are supportive of this legislation. I have a letter from Empower America that is signed by Jeane Kirkpatrick, former Ambassador to the United Nations; Jack Kemp, former Member of Congress and former Secretary of HUD; William Bennett, former Secretary of Education; Lamar Alexander, former Secretary of Education; and Steve Forbes. All of them are supporting the legislation, making some of the same points that have been made already in the debate this morning. They urge support of the bill. 
`We urge you to join in standing in solidarity with free people and democratic governments of our Central American neighbors and friends.' 
The point they stressed in the letter is that the Central American countries, who, in essence, we went to bat for in the 1980's to protect democracy and to move them toward freedom and capitalism, today are still struggling in that battle. To send several hundred thousand individuals back into an environment, for example, in Nicaragua, where the unemployment rate is 60 percent, would destabilize those countries, which would be just the opposite of the effort that we made in the 1980's.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, just to close this portion of the debate, there may be some that are saying, why are we doing this now? I ask people to try to put themselves in a position of a group of people who have, in fact, played by the rules, as was so eloquently laid out by Senator Abraham, and now there is the great potential that the rules could be changed on them and they would be denied due process. That is fundamentally wrong. 
I want people to think about what it must be like to wake up each morning and wonder whether you are going to be one of those that will be the subject of deportation. Think about the fear that must be going through that family, that mother or father, when that child goes off to school that afternoon or that morning. What is going to happen? Are they going to receive a notice of deportation? I know that our Nation does not want to impose that kind of fear on people. That is counter to everything that we believe. 
So again, I ask those who have listened to this debate and will be voting to vote in favor of this amendment.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the floor S. 462, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This bill is similar to public and assisted housing reform legislation, S. 1260, that was introduced in the 104th Congress and passed unanimously by this body. 
The Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 addresses a public housing system fraught with counterproductive rules and regulations that make it impossible for even the best run public housing authorities [PHA's] to operate effectively and efficiently. It will help to make public housing a platform from which residents can achieve the goal of economic independence and self-sufficiency. In addition, it promotes increased residential choice and mobility by increasing opportunities for residents to use tenant-based assistance. 
The following reforms contained in the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act represent significant improvements in current public and assisted housing policies. 
First, the bill consolidates a multitude of programs into two flexible block grants to expand the eligible uses of funds and allow more creative and efficient use of resources. The bill also repeals a number of current programs that are obsolete, unused, or unfunded. 
Second, it institutes permanent rent reforms such as ceiling rents, earned income adjustments, and minimum rents that provide PHA's with the tools to develop rental policies that encourage and reward work and further the goal of creating mixed-income communities. The bill also removes the floor on rents that may be charged under the Brooke amendment, while assuring that poor families will not pay more than 30 percent of their income for rent. 
Third, S. 462 requires tough, swift action against PHA's with severe management deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed receivers with the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled agencies and protect public housing residents. 
Fourth, it requires intervention with respect to severely distressed public housing developments that trap residents in deplorable living conditions and are costly to operate or maintain. It provides residents with alternative housing using vouchers or other available housing. 
Fifth, the bill permanently repeals the one-for-one replacement requirement and streamlines the demolition and disposition process to permit PHA's to demolish or sell vacant or obsolete public housing. 
Sixth, it gives PHA's broad flexibility to develop or participate with other providers of affordable housing in the development of mixed-income, mixed finance developments. 
Seventh, it repeals Federal preferences that have had the unintended consequence of concentrating the poorest of the poor in public housing developments and allows PHA's to operate according to locally established preferences consistent with local housing needs. The bill still maintains the requirement that most housing assistance be targeted to very low-income households. 
Eighth, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act calls on PHA's to increase coordination with State and local welfare agencies to ensure that welfare recipients living in public housing will have the full opportunity to move from welfare to work. 
Ninth, the bill provides residents with an active voice in developing the local PHA plans that will govern the operations and management of housing and for direct participation on housing authority boards of directors. It also authorizes funds for resident organizations to develop resident management and empowerment activities. 
Finally, S. 462 merges the section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single, choice-based program designed to operate more effectively in the private marketplace. It repeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to landlords, such as `take-one, take-all,' endless lease and 90-day termination notice requirements. These reforms will make participation in the section 8 tenant-based program more attractive to private landlords and increase housing choices for lower income families. 
The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve the Nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program and the lives of those who reside in federally assisted housing. The funding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day operations and policies of public authorities, encouragement of mixed-finance developments, policies to deal with distressed and troubled public housing, and rent reforms will change the face of public housing for PHA's, residents, and local communities. 
Reform of the public housing system has been and remains a bipartisan effort in the Senate. I want to thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato for his strong and steadfast support of public housing reform. Further, I appreciate the commitment of the ranking member of the Committee, Senator Sarbanes, and the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, Senator Kerry, to the reform effort.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for yielding. 
First of all, I want to commend him for a tremendous amount of work. This is an incredibly complicated piece of legislation. It has involved a lot of different interest groups in some issues that have become very charged. 
So I again want to thank the Senator from Vermont for his willingness to work with Senator Frist and I as we worked on the so-called off-label issue. 
I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy. He had some deep concerns about the legislation, and as a result of extensive discussions we were able to find a compromise. I think it was one of the reasons that this bill was able to move forward. 
So I thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy. And I also want to put in a comment with respect to Mark Smith, my staffer who has worked on this issue for more than some 2 1/2 years. 
Again, I thank Senator Jeffords for what he has done.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to add my strong support for S. 830, which will reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act as well as provide much-needed reforms to the FDA, and the approval process for prescription drugs and medical devices. 
I want to specifically address one area of FDA reform which has become one of the most controversial, and most often misunderstood, provision of this legislation. I'm referring to the issue of off-label information dissemination. 
This is an issue I've worked on for more than 2 years. Joining me in this effort have been Senators Frist, Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer. We come from different political parties. We have different political philosophies. But, there is one principle upon which we strongly agree. 
Physicians, and other health care professionals, should have the ability to receive credible scientific information from reputable medical journals and medical textbooks in order to make informed treatment decisions with their patients. 
However, because of an FDA policy--not a law, not a regulation, but a policy--that is not happening today. 
Let me explain. 
When the FDA approves a prescription drug or medical device, it does so for specific uses. Frequently, scientists find the FDA-approved prescription drug or medical device is also effective for other uses. Doctors are legally able to prescribe drugs or use devices for these new uses, which are called off-label uses. 
According to the American Medical Association, between 40 and 60 percent of all prescriptions written are for off-label uses. For cancer patients, up to 80 percent of prescriptions are for off-label uses. For example, the prescription drug Intron A has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma, hepatitis B, and other diseases. Additional studies, which were published in such prestigious publications as the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of Clinical Oncology, have shown the drug is also effective for such diseases as kidney cancer, myeloma--cancer of bone marrow--and bladder cancer. 
However, since 1991, the FDA has maintained a policy which prohibits manufacturers from giving doctors and other health care professionals scientific data about new uses of FDA-approved drugs and medical devices. 
That's simply bad public health policy--and the bipartisan agreement we have reached will correct this intolerable situation. 
The agreement will permit the dissemination to health care professionals of balanced, peer-reviewed articles from reputable medical journals and medical textbooks about new uses of FDA-approved prescription drugs and medical devices. 
It will also ensure that the important research on these important new uses of prescription drugs and medical devices moves forward. 
We ensure that only the highest quality of information can be disseminated by defining the specific criteria for medical journals and medical textbooks. It is important to note this legislation does not permit the dissemination of marketing materials, brochures, promotional materials, newspaper or magazine articles, or other industry-generated materials. 
Our legislation ensures that a balance of material about the use must be disseminated. Sixty days prior to dissemination, manufacturers must submit the article it desires to disseminate to FDA along with a bibliography of other medical journal articles about that off-label use. The Secretary has the option of adding an objective statement which describes additional scientific findings about that off-label use of the prescription drug or medical device. 
The intent is that the statement be limited to objective and scientific information, and not present an opportunity to editorialize about independently derived scientific information. That statement, along with the required bibliography, must accompany the article or textbook. In addition, companies must also submit and disseminate a detailed statement which discloses that the article being disseminated describes a scientific study about an off-label use; any potential conflict of interest of the authors of the article; the source of funding for both the study and the dissemination of the article; and a statement which discloses if other products or treatments have been approved by the FDA for the use described in the article. 
In other words, in addition to the article the company wants to share, the doctor will also receive: the disclosure statement; a statement of additional scientific findings from the Secretary of HHS; any previous FDA notices about that off-label use; a bibliography of other articles about that off-label use; and a copy of the FDA-approved labeling for the drug or device described in the article. 
In order to disseminate the medical journal articles and textbooks, manufacturers must agree to conduct the required clinical trials in order to apply for a supplemental new drug application. 
Companies must either certify they will file an SNDA within 6 months, or they must submit a clinical trial protocol and time schedule for conducting the needed studies to apply for an SNDA within 3 years. The Secretary of HHS may grant a 2-year extension to comply with this requirement if the company is acting in due diligence to conduct the studies in a timely manner. Periodic progress reports are required to be filed with the Secretary. Companies may apply for an exemption under very limited circumstances. 
The manufacturer is also required to share with the Secretary new information about that same off-label use of the drug or device. If the Secretary determines the new information demonstrates that the drug or device may not be effective or may pose a significant risk to public health, then the Secretary shall, in consultation with the manufacturer, take corrective action to ensure public health and safety. 
The provision provides the Secretary of HHS with strong oversight authority, including the ability to stop dissemination of articles and the ability to require manufacturers who violate the provisions of this legislation to either take corrective action or return to compliance. The Secretary can order a manufacturer to cease dissemination if the SNDA application is denied. 
We also require that two future studies be performed. One study will examine the impact this legislation has had on FDA resources. The other study will assess the quality of the information disseminated and it will examine how useful the information has been to doctors and other health care providers. 
It is important to note that this legislation will expire in 2006, unless Congress acts to continue it. 
This legislation has earned the enthusiastic support of the American Medical Association. Let me quote from the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs report:  
It is imperative that physicians have access to accurate and unbiased information about unlabeled uses of prescription drugs. Dissemination of independently derived scientific information about unlabeled uses by manufacturers to physicians can help physicians have access to the latest, scientifically credible information.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his hard work in getting this bill to the floor today. I also want to express my personal thanks for his including a truly historic appropriation for land acquisitions related to the Everglades restoration effort in my State of Florida. I would like to take a moment of the Senate's time today to engage the Senator from Washington in a colloquy. 
As the chairman well knows, the restoration effort encompasses all of south Florida, from the Kissimmee River in the north to the Florida Keys in the south. I understand that while the $66 million has been allocated for land acquisitions in Everglades National Park, the bill contains language allowing the Secretary to use these funds to purchase lands elsewhere in the south Florida ecosystem. Is that correct?

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Gorton has introduced an amendment which would return federal funding for education programs serving grades K-12 directly to school districts. Currently, nearly one third of all the money spent on education by the federal government ends up at the Department of Education. However, of that amount, only 13.1 percent actually reaches local school districts. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government currently administers so many education programs which it cannot efficiently control, nor can it determine if it is money well spent. The vast number of these programs are redundant and could be easily combined. Over the years, as new ideas and innovations in education have been enacted, we have not reviewed programs currently in place which serve similar purposes. The result has been a growing Washington bureaucracy, with more federal regulations affecting the day-to-day workings of our local schools. 
Clearly, when it comes to the education of our young people, one size does not fit all. This amendment would remove Washington bureaucrats from what should be local decisions. Parents, teachers, and local school officials are far better prepared to determine how best to use scarce resources. We should express our confidence in parents, our teachers and our principals to decide how best to use limited resources to meet the needs of children--who ultimately are the ones we must serve. Washington bureaucrats, far removed from these local situations, cannot accurately make those decisions. 
Mr. President, I am sure that during debate on this amendment and debate on this bill, we will hear from others in this body about the need to preserve Congress' role in providing for the education of our nation's children. Certainly, there is a role for Congress in this area, but I believe it is a more limited role. 
I must point out that this amendment would not reduce by one dime the amount of funding provided by the federal government for education nationwide. Instead, it will ensure that the status quo which has sentenced our schools to mediocrity will be reformed to enable parents, teachers and local decisionmakers to enact innovative reforms to our education system. 
Mr. President, I believe in this approach because I believe in parents--who have the biggest stake in their parent's success and fulfillment. I believe in teachers--who, everyday, stand before classrooms of children and challenge their minds with knowledge and ideas, who inspire them to dream and imagine, who help them open the doors to success. These are the ones we should seek to help, because their efforts will determine how America fares in the 21st Century--they will determine whether we continue to lead in the world or whether we will allow that leadership to fall on some other nation. 
I'm confident that our parents, teachers, and students can build the best education system in the world, if only Washington `experts' will just get out of the way. Let's show them that Congress believes in their abilities to make the right decisions for the future of our children by supporting this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

This center was authorized in 1992 as a freestanding bill and became Public Law 102-423. It would be offset by decreasing the salaries and expense accounts.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, we have good reason to celebrate what we have just accomplished by passing the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
We set out to help families pay for the education of their kids. It's done. We set out to provide a $500 credit for children. It's done. We set out to provide meaningful death tax relief. It's done. We set out to expand IRA's to encourage savings. It's done. We set out to provide significant capital gains relief. And it's done, too. 
The Taxpayer Relief Act is a great victory for the American people. But we cannot rest on this accomplishment, when there is much else that needs to be done. I am today introducing legislation to permanently extend the research and experimentation tax credit. In the tax bill we just passed, the research and experimentation tax credit is extended a mere 13 months, to June 30, 1998. This extension is disappointing. 
The research credit has provided a valuable economic incentive for U.S. companies to increase their investment in research and development in order to maintain their competitive edge in the global marketplace. A permanent extension of the research credit is critical to fast-growing research-intensive companies such as those in the computer, telecommunications, and biotechnology industries. 
For these companies, an incentive to increase investment in research plays a critical role in determining whether future research projects, many of which span many years in length, are started, continued, or abandoned. The incentive benefit of the current research credit is reduced because of its temporary and uncertain nature. The bill I am today introducing will correct this problem, and make the research tax credit an incentive that our high-technology companies can count on.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, just over 1 week ago, Congressman Chris Cox, together with many other Members of the House of Representatives, including Ben Gilman, Gerald Solomon, Duncan Hunter, Tillie Fowler, Chris Smith, Ed Royce, Bill McCollum, Henry Hyde, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced an 11-point legislative plan to address our Nation's failure to truly engage the People's Republic of China. Senator Tim Hutchinson and I joined in the unveiling of the House proposals to show our support for the good work done by our House colleagues and endorse the leadership of Congressman Cox. I also promised at that time to introduce companion legislation in the Senate. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer that bill, the United States-People's Republic of China National Security and Freedom Protection Act. I am proud to say that Senator Hutchinson and Senator Ashcroft are joining me in introducing this bill today. 
Mr. President, I also want to congratulate Senator Abraham for his interest and work on developing a China policy. He has played an instrumental role in advancing the debate on this important issue. 
Mr. President, I come to this discussion of China policy following my 7 years of involvement with the people of Hong Kong and their commitment to freedom and democratic reforms. As Senate cochair of the congressional caucus on Hong Kong, I traveled to Hong Kong and China in late March of this year with the Democratic cochair, Senator Joe Lieberman. 
I must confess that on this recent trip, my concerns for the people of China and the future United States-People's Republic of China relationship increased. I was struck by the dichotomy between the people and the leadership in China. People's Republic of China officials expressed the view that people made governing difficult, as if the people exist for the benefit of the government. This fundamentally opposes my belief that people know what is best for themselves, and that government is for the benefit of the people. The official People's Republic of China view puts people at odds with government. 
Mr. President, in China, I attended church and visited with people at the Forbidden City, and saw in the eyes of children and parents throughout China the same thing I see here in America. I saw children full of hope and wonder, and parents full of pride and ambition for their children. 
I fear that these differences between the United States and China will lead us toward conflict unless we have a sound policy for which we can actively work toward improving relations. The administration calls their policy `strategic engagement.' I call it appeasement. Any policy which does not allow Americans to address their concerns with the People's Republic of China will prove irresponsible. I am introducing this bill today so that the children of China and the United States can grow up in peace, benefiting from each others' freedom and prosperity. 
Mr. President, this bill takes root in a belief that our China policy must contain five essential elements. 
First, United States policy should seek liberalization of the People's Republic of China Government, responsible behavior by the People's Republic of China, and integration of the People's Republic of China into the community of nations. United States interests are best served in China, as they are everywhere, when they are defined by the United States national security strategy: in the proliferation of democracy and the liberalization of authoritarian forms of government. 
Second, United States policy should continue to maintain a strong presence and commitment to leadership and involvement in the Asian Pacific region. The policy should be regionally and globally integrated. The United States shares a stake in China's future with the people of China, the region, and the world. 
Third, United States policy should encourage friendship between our nations while protecting national interests and acting on national values. The People's Republic of China does not today, and will not for the foreseeable future, pose a 
direct military threat to the United States. The People's Republic of China is not an enemy of the United States and should not be made out as such. 
Fourth, United States policy toward China should contain resolute and straight-forward toughness. United States policy toward China must not paper over issues which make China feel uncomfortable, but these issues should not dominate the relationship either. United States policy should seek to overcome these differences with the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China expects the United States to act honestly and directly, and the American people require a foreign policy which is honest and direct. 
And finally, United States policy should be a policy of meaningful engagement which includes the mechanisms of this act. In order to fulfill a meaningful policy with respect to the People's Republic of China, more tools are needed to address American interests beyond those available in the current policy. 
Mr. President, this bill provides a broad and positive context for dealing with the People's Republic of China and encouraging China's democratic development. 
It is divided into three main sections: national security, human rights, and trade. It uses targeted sanctions and increased diplomacy as its primary tools. Economic sanctions are imposed against the People's Liberation Army, which is banned from operating commercially in the United States. Political sanctions are imposed against human rights violators by denying entry into the United States to those responsible for religious persecution, coercive family planning practices, and political oppression. The act also calls for military sanctions as provided for in the Gore-McCain Nonproliferation Act. 
The sanctions are complemented by additional advocacy and reporting requirements placed upon United States diplomatic and customs officers in the People's Republic of China. The act provides for additional authorizations to meet these requirements, as well as to improve the broadcasting effectiveness of Radio Free Asia. To demonstrate support for Taiwan and clarity in our Taiwan policy, the Act requires a bilateral study assessing the need for and feasibility of providing TMD to Taiwan. 
The bill concludes with a title calling for review of the mechanisms called for in this act based upon China's behavior. 
Mr. President, perhaps within our lifetimes, and almost certainly in the lives of our children, China will become a premier Asian power. Whether that is a threat or a promise depends in large part on whether we rise to the occasion by asserting our values and interests while at the same time helping China meet its new responsibilities. Continuing down a policy track which offers choices only between inadequate engagement or quixotic containment is a journey that will end as it began, in frustration without alternatives. We cannot allow that to be our legacy.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I join my friends Senator Graham and Senator Kennedy in introducing a bill which would ease the transition into implementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 [IIRAIRA] for certain Central American immigrants. This legislation, which has been requested by President Clinton, is designed to ensure that those immigrants who were in the administrative pipeline at the time IIRAIRA took effect will have their cases decided under the set of rules in place before enactment of IIRAIRA. This legislation will by no means grant amnesty to anyone; it will ensure that each individual will have their application for suspension of deportation given full and fair consideration. 
This legislation is a matter of freedom, justice, human rights and fundamental fairness. During consideration of IIRAIRA, I maintained that those immigrants who were already in this country should not have the rules changed on them midstream. Many Central American immigrants have planted deep roots in the United States and are valued members of their communities. They should be free from the fear of deportation without a full consideration of their request for suspension of that deportation under the set of rules in place at the time that they applied. 
Ten years ago, in the mountains of Nicaragua, I spoke to thousands of young men who were fighting for freedom. I told them then that we would not forget them, and I tell them now that we will not forget them. 
I urge the Senate's expedient consideration and passage of this legislation.

Mr. MACK. I would like to commend Senator Bond for addressing the section 8 contract expiration issue by including S. 513, the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 in the VA/HUD appropriations bill. This legislation, which is cosponsored by my colleague from Missouri and Senators D'Amato, Bennett, Domenici, Faircloth, Grams, and Chafee, is a national priority for reforming the Department of Housing and Urban Development's HUD multifamily housing programs and reducing the escalating costs of project-based section 8 renewals. According to preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation will save the American taxpayer about $4.6 billion in section 8 funds over the next 10 years. This legislation not only saves scarce Federal resources, it also protects the Federal investment in affordable housing by screening out distressed properties and noncompliant owners from the Federal programs and addresses HUD's management problems with this portfolio by utilizing capable public and private third parties. 
It is critical to enact this legislation into law this year. The Banking Committee unanimously approved S. 513 as part of its budget reconciliation package this June. Unfortunately, the Senate and House subconferees were unable to come to an agreement on this legislation and subsequently, it was dropped out of the reconciliation package. Accordingly, I will continue to push this legislation and strongly support Senator Bond's effort in passing S. 513 as part of the appropriations bill. 
When Secretary Cuomo testified before the Banking Committee on S. 513, he raised several concerns about the restructuring process outlined in the bill. But he also indicated his willingness to address those concerns through negotiations with the Senate. I want to point out that significant progress has been made to address the administration's concerns with the bill. Two major areas where agreement was reached relate to the use of third parties or participating administrative entities [PAE] and the use of tenant-based assistance. On the use of PAE's, HUD has agreed to maintain the Senate's priority for State and local housing finance agencies to serve as restructuring entities. However, the Senate has agreed to provide additional flexibility to the Secretary in selecting qualified PAE's while protecting the public purpose. Also, the Senate and administration have agreed to provide discretion to PAE's in determining whether tenant-based or project-based assistance will be provided for qualified properties after restructuring. 
I would like to ask Senator Bond for his assurance that, as this process moves forward, he will endeavor to assure that the agreements made with the administration are incorporated into the bill.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, to introduce legislation approving an agreement between the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and the State of Florida. This agreement arose from disputes surrounding the construction of Interstate 75 through the Miccosukee Reservation in Florida. 
By way of background, Mr. President, when the interstate was built from Naples across to Fort Lauderdale, the Florida Department of Transportation dredged fill dirt off the northern Miccosukee Indian Reservation and used it to construct the roadbed. The Miccosukees subsequently sued in Federal District Court on the basis of an unlawful taking of property. 
The State and the Miccosukees subsequently worked out a settlement whereby Florida would keep the fill-dirt and the Indians would get several parcels of State land. One parcel is adjacent to the tribe's permit lands on Tamiami Trail and another is near the Krome Detention Center in Miami. This agreement has been signed by the Miccosukees and the Department of Interior and was endorsed unanimously by the Governor and Cabinet of Florida. 
The bill we are introducing today will direct the Secretary of the Interior--as the Federal trustee of the Miccosukees--to: 
First, aid and assist in the fulfillment of the settlement agreement in a reasonable manner; second, upon finding that the agreement is legally sufficient, the Secretary should sign the agreement on behalf of the United States; third, facilitate the transfer of Miccosukee land--the fill-dirt--to the Florida Department of Transportation under the terms of the agreement, and; fourth, receive in Federal trust--on behalf of the Miccosukees--the land put up by the State for the swap--adjacent to Permit Area and Krome. 
Mr. President, this legislation has also been introduced by Representative Diaz-Balart in the House of Representatives. The enactment of this legislation is very important to the Miccosukee Tribe and I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Texas for her comments this morning and for her involvement in expressing the importance of the actions on the part of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I also want to express my support for the committee itself and the inquiry that began some 6 months ago. As elected officials, it is our duty not only to change the laws when necessary but to abide by them. The hearings that began in the Governmental Affairs Committee yesterday are an inquiry into just how well the Clinton administration abided by the law during the last election cycle. The Democrat Party and the White House would like the American public to think that they did nothing different than anyone else, and that everybody does it and therefore we must change the law. 
That just simply is not true. No, not everybody does it. Before we begin considering what new laws to pass, we ought to examine who has violated the ones we have on the books now. In my view, the administration will have no standing to debate the issue of campaign finance reform until they prove that we can live and that they can live within the law as it currently stands. It does little good to create new laws if our leaders don't follow them with principle, integrity, and some semblance of morality. We ought to have leaders who adhere to the spirit 
of the laws--rather than to push the envelope of propriety. 
Unfortunately, there are credible allegations that the Clinton administration exhibited precious little principle, integrity, or morality in the conduct of their last campaign. The committee will be looking into whether the Clinton administration knowingly accepted illegal foreign contributions, allowed money laundering to occur, or actively engaged in the unlawful solicitation of campaign donations in Federal buildings. Worst of all, the committee must determine the true nature and extent of what appears to be a calculated attempt by the Chinese Government to buy influence in the last election. 
Senator Thompson's committee has uncovered evidence of a detailed plan by China to illegally increase their influence over the United States legal process. They found that China has invested substantial sums of money in this effort and that the White House was made aware of the plan prior to the election but did nothing to prevent it from succeeding. Disturbingly, the Chinese plan continues today. The committee must now determine who knew or should have known about this plan and how it came to be implemented. 
I commend Senator Thompson and his team for uncovering this shocking infiltration of our electoral system by another government. Judging by the level of complaining by Democrats, he must be close to the truth. When you get right down to it, these hearings are about the lack of shame in this administration. No one in this administration is ashamed of the fact that they may have broken the laws to win the election. No one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that the President and Vice President reportedly leaned on donors from the comfort of the White House. That is illegal. And no one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that overnight stays in the Lincoln bedroom were for sale to the highest bidder. The White House should not be for sale. No one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that poor religious people were preyed upon for illegal donations. They should be beyond such political manipulation. No one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that fundraising safeguards were jettisoned so that illegal foreign cash came rolling in with no questions asked. Compliance with our country's election laws is not optional. No one in this administration seems to be ashamed of the fact that a midlevel political appointee potentially compromised our national security. 
He should never have been in a position to do so. 
This administration seems incapable of being ashamed of any of this. Rather, they continue to rationalize their actions in an attempt to deflect the negative publicity with hollow calls for campaign finance reform. Unlike others who attempt to tear down our current system, I hope Senator Thompson and the members of the Governmental Affairs Committee are able to restore some confidence in our system through these hearings. Calling people to publicly account for their wrongdoing is the first step in that journey. 
Finally, I want to thank Senator Thompson for his forbearance. He has shown great tolerance and conducted himself like a gentleman, at times when courtesy has been hard to muster. The administration continues to stonewall the committee on producing documents; witnesses have claimed their fifth amendment privilege; targets have fled the country; and a paper trail consisting of millions of pages have been left for the committee to unravel. 
Today, I express my gratitude to him for taking on this unpleasant job, and I wish the committee members patience and good judgment in exercising their duties to uncover what has heretofore been covered up. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Lieberman, to introduce the Hong Kong Press Freedom Act. 
Mr. President, as we consider China and Hong Kong in these final weeks before Hong Kong reversion, it is important for us to reflect on the facts, and what drives our behaviors toward China. 
We fought the Cold War for freedom and democracy. The war is over, but we know of 1.2 billion people still wearing the yoke of communism--or at least nondemocratic oppression. On July 1, we might be forced to witness that number grow by 6 million as Hong Kong falls under control of the People's Republic of China. If the defining moment of the 1980s was the crumbling of the Berlin Wall and the spread of freedom and democracy, we should not allow this decade to be remembered most by the victory of totalitarianism over human dignity. 
One essential element of freedom is press freedom. Until recently, Hong Kong enjoyed one of the freest presses in the world. But already, experts point to instances of self censorship occurring on the island. All indications are that this freedom will continue to deteriorate following Hong Kong's reversion. 
Today, I am introducing a bill in the Senate to encourage press freedom in Hong Kong. A similar measure was introduced in the House by Representative Porter and 27 other members in February. The measure supports those Hong Kong journalists who chose to remain loyal to the standards of honest and open reporting. Specifically, this bill provides special immigration status to journalists and their families should they be threatened as a result of their reporting. When Senator Lieberman and I visited Hong Kong earlier this year, we heard several stories of self-censorship occurring in the Hong Kong press. Many of the larger papers were losing circulation and the underground and small papers were growing. It is this free thought and competition which we seek to preserve. 
Without press freedom, what other freedom can survive? While this is a small and specific measure, its impact can be profound. I urge immediate consideration and passage of this measure.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Graham, to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act. This legislation will cancel the six oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf closest to Florida's coast. Representative Scarborough is leading a similar effort in the House of Representatives. 
Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned about the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our State. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our environment and our economy. 
Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and drilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal the entire Florida congressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from our coastlines. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to drilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all new leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf. 
The reason for our concern is simple, Mr. President. In Florida, a healthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to our State each year to enjoy the climate, the coastlines, and our fine quality of life. It would only take one disaster to end Florida's good standing as America's vacationland and we cannot afford to let that happen. 
Mr. President, if the current exploration plan runs its course, there is the potential for the operation of up to 400 drill rigs off Florida's panhandle. A recent permit report from the Environmental Protection Agency states that a typical rig can be expected to discharge between 6,500 and 13,000 barrels of waste. This presents a huge potential for damage to our near-shore coastal waters and beaches. The report warns of further harmful impact on marine mammal populations, fish populations, and air quality. We cannot afford these risks in Florida and we do not want these risks in Florida. 
But while the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well documented, the reality remains that leases have been let, potential drilling sites have been explored and it is likely that actual extraction of resources will take place 17 miles off the coast of Florida. Mr. President, if this is allowed to happen, the drill rigs will be within the line of sight from vacationers in Pensacola. This Congress must not allow that to happen. 
The legislation we are introducing today is very simple. It provides for cancellation of the lease tract 17 miles off Pensacola. Under the OCS Lands Act, Mr. President, the current holders of these leases would be entitled to fair compensation for their investment. This is only fair. The bill also makes permanent the moratorium on any new leasing activity in order to ensure the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida is not repeated. 
If the threat of oil and gas exploration is to be permanently removed from our shores, it will require responsible leadership from the Congress. This legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary to protect our state's economic and environmental well-being. 
I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile effort.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem and to congratulate the people of Israel on their commitment to freedom. 
Jerusalem, Mr. President, is a city unique in all the world. We know much of its 3,000 year history. We know that Jerusalem has been a great city for many people; we know that it remains a holy city for people throughout the world; we know that it is an inseparable part of the Jewish state, a fundamental part of Jewish identity; and we know that it is the undivided capital of the State of Israel. 
It was on the hill which we call the Temple Mount that overlooked the Jerusalem of Abraham, where God called upon Abraham to bring his son to be sacrificed; it was here that God made His covenant with man. Jerusalem holds the remains of the first and second temples including the Western Wall of the temple's courtyard, Judaism's holiest site. It is to Jerusalem that Jews everywhere in the world turn in prayer and, no matter where they live, they conclude their celebrations with the refrain `next year in Jerusalem.' 
Mr. President, I would like to read from perhaps the most moving description of this great city delivered by one of Israel's greatest leaders and statesmen. In 1995, the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin delivered the following remarks here in the U.S. Capitol: 
Jerusalem is the heart of the Jewish people and a deep source of our pride. On this festive occasion, thousands of miles from home, here and now, we once again are raising Jerusalem above our highest joy, just like our fathers and our fathers' fathers did. 
Jerusalem has a thousand faces--and each one of us has his own Jerusalem. 
My Jerusalem is Dr. Moshe Wallach of Germany, the doctor of the sick of Israel and Jerusalem, who built Sha'arei Zedek hospital and had his home in its courtyard so as to be close to his patients day and night. I was born in his hospital . . . 
My Jerusalem is the focus of the Jewish people's yearnings, the city of its visions, the cradle of its prayers. It is the dream of the return to Zion. It is the name millions murmur, even on their death bed. It is the place where eyes are raised and prayers are uttered. 
My Jerusalem is the jerrycan of water measured out to the besieged in 1948, the faces of its anxious citizens quietly waiting in line for bread, the sky whose blackness was torn by flares. 
My Jerusalem is Bab el-Wad--the road to the city--which cries out, `Remember our names forever.' It is the ashen faces of dead comrades from the War of Independence, and the searing cold of the rusting armored cars among the pines on the side of the road. 
My Jerusalem is the great mountain, the military cemetery on Mount Herzl, the city of silence whose earth holds the treasured thousands of those who went to bitter battle--and did not return. 
My Jerusalem is the tears of the paratroopers at the Western Wall in 1967 and the flag which once more waved above the remnant of the Temple. 
My Jerusalem is the changing colors of its walls, the smells of its markets and the faces of the members of every community and every faith, where all have freedom of thought and freedom of worship in the city where holiness envelops every stone, every word, every glance. 
And my Jerusalem is the City of Peace, which will bear great tidings to all faiths, to all nations, `For the Torah shall come forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem . . . Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces.' 
We differ in our opinions, left and right. We disagree on the means and the objective. In Israel, we all agree on one issue: the wholeness of Jerusalem, the continuation of its existence as capital of the State of Israel. There are no two Jerusalems. There is only one Jerusalem. For us, Jerusalem is not subject to compromise, and there is no peace without Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem, which was destroyed eight times, where for years we had no access to the remnants of our Temple, was ours, is ours, and will be ours--forever. 
`Here tears do not weaken eyes,' wrote the Jerusalem poet Yehuda Amichai. `They only polish and shine the hardness of faces like stone.' Jerusalem is that stone. 
Mr. President, Jerusalem is more than the heart of the Jewish people. It is sacred throughout the world. Jesus was crucified inside today's city, and Mohammed was said to have ascended into Heaven from the Temple Mount. Mr. President, Jerusalem indeed is a great city; it is a city of the world, a city revered by the world, and a city for the world. Its freedom is invaluable. 
Unfortunately, from 1948 to 1967, beginning with the war waged against the new State of Israel and ending with Israel's victory in the Six-Day War, Jerusalem was a divided city. During this time, Israelis of all faiths and Jews from around the world were prohibited from entering the eastern part of the city and from praying at the holy sites there. Jerusalem had lost its freedom, and the world had lost its Jerusalem. 
This week, Mr. President, marks the anniversary of the liberation of the holy city and its return to freedom. That is why we are congratulating the people of Jerusalem. 
Today, Jerusalem is a city of growth, prosperity, and freedom. Upon their victory in 1967, those denied the city for so long did not deny it to the defeated. To this day, perhaps the most holy site for all three major religions of the city remains housed in a Moslem mosque, the Dome of the Rock. But it is a place which can be visited by anyone who desires. 
So, beyond honoring the freedom of this great city, I want to congratulate the people of Jerusalem and of Israel for their commitment to religious freedom and the principle that religious faiths should not pay the price of political disputes. The Jews of Israel know very well the importance of religious freedom, and the pain of its denial. 
Today, as we remember Jerusalem's proud and turbulent past, and honor its freedom-loving residents, we must appreciate the continuing threat to the city's future. 
Thirty years ago today, Mr. President, Israel was at war, fighting for the freedom and indivisibility of Jerusalem. I submit that today, Israel remains at war. We must remember, as the peace which seeks to end this war ebbs and flows, that many people in and around Israel are trying to accomplish through other means what they failed to do in 1967--push Israel into the Mediterranean Sea. In this environment, we must not assume all parties are equally right and equally wrong. The middle of a dispute is usually not halfway in between the belligerents. Treating bombs in cafes and on buses as morally equivalent to bulldozers on deserted hilltops jeopardizes peace. 
The Senate, on May 20, passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 21, marking the anniversary of Jerusalem's reunification and congratulating the people of Israel. The measure had 88 initial cosponsors and passed unanimously. This clear message cannot be misunderstood. There is only one Jerusalem and it is the undivided capital of Israel. As the peace process continues there should be no doubt about where the U.S. Senate stands. The Senate strongly believes that Jerusalem must remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected as they have been by Israel during the past 30 years and calls upon the President and Secretary of State to publicly affirm as a matter of United States policy that Jerusalem must remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on June 4, 1989, the People's Republic of China perpetrated a bloody massacre against her own people. Thousands of freedom-seeking people took to the streets only to be put down violently by the long arm of the Chinese Government. Today, 8 years later, what has changed with that Government to reassure us that such atrocities will not happen again? Not much. Those in power remain in power, and they express no remorse. The only significant change is that every major dissident in China today is imprisoned. 
Today, those same rulers in Beijing, their princeling children, and the military leaders of the People's Liberation Army strengthen themselves through operating commercial activities in the United States. We allow a regime willing to use violence against its own people, surely capable of directing that violence outwardly, to develop and strengthen through profits obtained in the United States. This is intolerable and must be stopped. 
On the occasion of the eighth annual remembrance of the Tiananmen Square massacre, I call upon the President and Congress to work together to address this gross error in U.S. policy which threatens even our own national security. This must be an essential element of a new China policy which creates effective ways to address U.S. trade, human rights, and security concerns. 
We have the opportunity of the 1997 MFN debate to address our concerns with, and even support for, China. We must use this opportunity to engage in an earnest debate over the proper form of engagement. We should not accept the simple refrain, engagement is better than containment as a substitute for a substantive policy.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition. 
I, like my colleagues, have come to the floor of the Senate today to express my fond feelings for Senator Thurmond, the Senator from South Carolina. As he is fond of saying about so many of us that he campaigns for, he is a man of character. He is a man of capacity. 
And I would add that he truly is a man who cares about his fellow man. 
Senator Stevens said a moment ago that Senator Thurmond is someone we can all learn from. I can tell you as a fellow who was running, campaigning for the Senate in 1988, Senator Thurmond volunteered to come to Florida to campaign for me. One of the things he said prior to making that commitment was that `if I come, I want to be busy. I do not want to come down there for just one or two events. I want to come down there, I want to be busy.' We picked him up at about 5:30 in the morning and we finished that day about 10 o'clock at night. We traveled from Jacksonville, FL, down through the center part of the State, to Lakeland and Tampa, and then an event close to Winter Haven that evening, never missing a beat. 
And again, I say I learned not just about campaigning but I truly learned about the heart of the man because about halfway through the day there was a press conference set up. He asked me if he could make a phone call before we did that press conference. And, of course, I said sure. And as I stood by him I realized what he was doing. He was calling a family in South Carolina that experienced the loss of a family member. Here is this man who has been elected and reelected and reelected and reelected, and loved in South Carolina in the middle of a tough day campaigning taking a moment out of that busy schedule to reach out to that family in South Carolina to say we understand your concern, the pain that you are feeling, we are concerned about you; I am concerned about you. Your family member was a great, great person; he meant so much to me. 
Can you imagine the sense of love the family felt that day. If anybody ever questions why Senator Thurmond has been elected and reelected and reelected and reelected, it is because he is a man who truly cares about others, whose heart is filled with love. 
I came to the Senate 9 years ago, and in a sense Senator Thurmond acts as a bridge between one generation of my family and myself. My step-grandfather retired from the Senate in December 1952, and Senator Thurmond, if I have that correct, was sworn in to the Senate in the next Congress, and so he served in that interim period of time between the time that my step-grandfather retired from the Senate and I came to the Senate. 
What an inspiration he has been to me. Frankly, Senator Thurmond, you have created a new dimension of what service to this country is all about. You have created a new dimension about service to the Senate. A moment ago I heard Senator Stevens talk about a strong heart, and it triggered in my mind that in essence, Senator Thurmond, you are a modern day brave heart, and it is has been a true honor to serve with you in the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and the following Senators: Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Frist, Specter, Harkin, D'Amato, DeWine, Boxer, Collins, Durbin, Reid, Breaux, and Dorgan. 
Madam President, let me quickly state the amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Let me just say to my colleagues that I recognize that what we are doing here is merely making a statement. But I think it is an important statement to be made. 
This has to do with a sense of the Senate about doubling the investment in the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years. 
It further States that it is our intent that the investments of the National Institutes of Health be increased by $2 billion in this next fiscal year. 
I begin my remarks, as I do often about this issue, by speaking about my own personal experiences, in essence, what motivates me to offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
Before I get into those kinds of personal feelings, maybe I ought to share with my colleagues an experience that I had just a few months ago, the last hearing that the Senate--at least I believe it was--the last hearing that the Senate held in the 104th Congress. It was a hearing that was chaired by Senator Hatfield and Senator Cohen, and it was a hearing to raise the awareness of the American people about the advantages and the needs of more research dollars. 
General Schwarzkopf was one of those individuals who testified. He, in essence, said that one of these days the American people are going to realize how little we have invested in basic research in health care, in health care research, health research in this country, how little we have done. He said, in essence, when they find that out, they are going to be mad as hell and they are going to want something done about it. 
I have spent many years now here in the Senate trying to raise the voices of concern, and the time has now come, frankly, that another year cannot pass without this Congress and this Senate making a commitment to doubling the investment at the National Institutes of Health. 
And I say so in recognizing I do this from an emotional perspective because I, like so many others, represent families that have been devastated by disease. 
In my particular case, I am talking about cancer. Since the last time I spoke on the floor of the Senate about this issue I lost another member of my family to the disease. I lost my father, who died at the age of 83 with esophageal cancer. 
I remember at a particular moment as he was fighting the disease, and I guess this moment comes for most of us, dad realized regardless of all the advantages and all the breakthroughs that have taken place with research, that frankly nothing more could be done for him. One of the doctors suggested what they needed to do next was to insert a feeding tube into his stomach. Dad's reaction to the doctor was, `That's not going to happen to me. I have lived a pretty good life. I have raised eight children,' and he said with a little grin, `They have all done pretty well. So I look upon my life as one that has been pretty successful.' He said, `It's time for me to die. I'm going back home. I'm not going to stay in the hospital. I'm not going to eat anything else. I'm not going to drink anything else. It is time for me to die. I accept that.' 
That was totally different than the experience that I had with my younger brother who died of melanoma at the age of 35. At that age, I guess it is almost impossible to give up. You have a sense that you have got to fight every step of the way. Maybe there will be a discovery made is the sense of what people feel. I can tell you as a member of the family, I sure was hopeful, each day, maybe a new procedure, maybe a new experimental drug would come along and save my brother Michael's life, who for 12 years, from the age of 23, on knew that each year could be the year in which he would lose his life. 
So I say today, Madam President, I can no longer be kind of quiet about this issue. I realize I am here today speaking about my own personal experiences, but in essence I represent every family in America. Why are we taking this? Why have we, as a Nation, said over and over and over again we do not have the money to invest in this kind of research? We are talking about $2 billion more in this next fiscal year--$2 billion more, and we are told we do not have the money. Now I know how difficult it is going to be to find it. I do not mean to be underestimating that. But if our Nation made the commitment to do it we could find the resources to invest $2 billion more at the National Institutes of Health. 
As I say, my story is a story about cancer. I was diagnosed with the same cancer that killed my brother, within months after I came to the U.S. Senate. And I would say this, if it had not have been for Michael's death, I probably would have been the one who died because I would not have been sensitive to the information on the early warning signs of the disease. I would have ignored the mole on my side until maybe it was too late. All I am saying is I do not think we as a Nation should ignore the warning signs. 
You can talk about Parkinson's disease, and many of us have had the opportunity to talk with Morton Kondracke or with Joan Samuelson. In my case, a dear friend, Bob Finkernagle, another dear friend, Pat Hucker, whose wife is suffering with the disease. There have been tremendous breakthroughs with respect to Parkinson's disease but there is a lot more out there that can be discovered, a lot more that can be done. 
During these past several years I have had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Varmas, Dr. Klausner, Francis Collins, all out at the National Institutes of Health, and as you listen to them talk about breakthrough after breakthrough after breakthrough you cannot help but be excited about what the opportunities are for further investments in medical research. 
There is a gene known at the P-53 gene with respect to cancer. Interestingly enough, this gene, when it malfunctions, when it is mutated, has been found in somewhere between 50 percent and 80 percent of all cancers. It is a tumor suppressor gene and research scientists all across America and around the world are, in fact, trying to figure out the mechanism. They have indicated that in their tests in the laboratory that when a P-53 gene that is not 
mutated is placed in with other cells it, in fact, stops the growth of those cells. More money needs to be invested to find out whether P-53 holds a key for a cure. 
What can be the benefits from more research? One of the things that would happen is that we would see that the number of people that participate in clinical trials would go from 2 percent to 20 percent. What does that mean to the average person? Well, it means that some mother or some father or some brother, some sister, might have an opportunity to have drugs that are available on the market but only through a clinical trial. We would increase from 2 percent to 20 percent if we were to double the investment at NIH. 
The number of grants that would be approved would jump from 25 percent to 40 percent. More access to state-of-the-art care, ability for the research centers to attract new talent. I could go on and on. 
The point here is this, and I will close my comments at this time, with another story from that same hearing that I referred to a little bit earlier. There was an individual on that panel with General Schwarzkopf by the name of Travis Roy. Travis Roy is a young man whose dream it was to play ice hockey in Boston, and he succeeded. Unfortunately, in the first 11 seconds of a game he was hit in such a manner that he is paralyzed from the neck down. He said to the Members at that hearing, to the panel, that his dream was to be able to hug his mother again someday. You know something, if we had listened to that 15 years ago, our reaction, sure, we would have had the compassion and the concern for that young man, but in the back of our mind we would have said, but you know there is nothing we can do about it. Well, something dramatically has changed in America. We no longer believe that there is nothing we can do about it. We have seen so much happen in the field of research that we now believe there are opportunities all across the board in all different kinds of diseases for breakthroughs that will save lives. 
Today, I had the opportunity to listen to a physician by the name of LaSalle LaFalle, a former President of the American Cancer Society. He said, `When I was trained, I was told that there was no cure for leukemia, that everyone died from leukemia. Hodgkin's disease, everyone died from Hodgkin's disease.' We know now the cure rate of leukemia is around 60 percent, and Hodgkin's disease is 80 percent. That is a result of the investments we made in basic research. I ask my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. MACK. As I listened to the discussion, and most of you heard me go through some of my experiences, I will never forget the moment that my wife told me she had discovered a lump in her breast and the doctor had told her that she had cancer. The sense of terror that gripped both of us, the sense of fear that we experienced--and I must say to you, there were a lot of selfish feelings going on inside me. I thought that I was going to lose my wife, that she would die of cancer. That is the reaction most people have when they are told they have cancer. I thought I was going to lose her. And so I wonder to myself, knowing what we know today, the breakthroughs that have already taken place in research, what keeps us from doubling the investment at NIH? Why will people accept the notion that we cannot do more? 
I just cannot comprehend that. And so I would ask my colleagues tonight to support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, recognizing that it is only the first step in a long, hard fight to find the dollars to double the investment in the National Institutes of Health. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today because a bill is being introduced by Senators Roth, Moynihan, and members of the Finance Committee which seeks to amend trade laws and provisions referring to `Most Favored Nation' [MFN] trading status. They seek to rename MFN, `Normal Trade Relations.' 
I am not joining my Finance Committee colleagues on this bill today. But I would gladly support this initiative once the United States has an effective China policy. 
Mr. President, the reason we annually consider China's trade, human rights, and national security behavior during the MFN renewal debate is because we do not have an acceptable alternative. The goal, therefore, of this year's debate should not be to simply extend or revoke MFN for the PRC. I suggest, instead, that we endeavor to address the shortcomings of our China policy so that we do not need the annual MFN issue to debate China. 
Mr. President, we need a real China policy to replace the MFN revocation threat, not a name change. If the issue were just about the name, Americans would not voice such strong opposition to trading with China as if it were a normal country. The fact is, Mr. President, China is not like other trading nations. It is perhaps the worst violator of human rights and weapons nonproliferation standards in the world. The PRC trades unfairly, persecutes people of faith, imprisons and tortures democrats, proliferates weapons technology, sells arms to street gangs in the United States, and disbands democratic institutions in Hong Kong. The PRC does this while receiving international aid, American technology--much with military applications, and free access to the American market. This so-called engagement policy seems hollow and dangerous. Merely changing the name of MFN will not change this reality. 
Mr. President, I traveled to Hong Kong and China in late March this year with my colleague and fellow co-chair of the Senate's Hong Kong caucus, 
Senator Lieberman of Connecticut. 
I returned from this mission more concerned about Hong Kong than when I departed. The Chinese leadership tried to put to rest my concerns for Hong Kong by reassuring me that democracy would be returned to Hong Kong once the people received proper civic education. This distrust of people is apparent in China's actions toward Hong Kong's civil and political freedoms. 
It also caused me to renew my concern for our China policy. My position on this bill, and on the MFN debate in general, arises from my desire for good relations with China. I know this is in the best interest of America, China, and the world. 
There are a tremendous number of issues which Americans wish to raise with China. In 1997, these include Hong Kong reversion, weapons proliferation, religious persecution, PRC-Taiwan relations, human rights, involvement in U.S. elections, and our unequal trade relationship. 
Many people advise, however, that opposing MFN represents a hollow--essentially meaningless--threat. And yet, without a responsible alternative, Members of Congress must choose between voting to revoke MFN or taking no action. Neither option is acceptable. Neither choice is in our Nation's best interest. 
So that our children and the children of China do not inherit an adversarial relationship, we must do two things in 1997. First, we must engage in a domestic debate on China; we must get beyond hollow engagement and hollow threats. Second, we must ensure our policy demonstrates to China that their actions have consequences: That they are a member of the world community and actions which violate agreements and norms are not merely internal matters. 
As many people know, I had discussed an idea to extend the current MFN status for the PRC for an additional 3 months in 1997. In offering this idea, I sought to accomplish the above two goals. It is too late for the House to take action on the 3-month extension as I had proposed it, but it is not too late for us to unite behind a call for action. 
Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished Finance Committee colleagues who believe we must get beyond the annual MFN revocation threat. But the way to do this is not to change the name of MFN; we must address the real problem. We must develop new instruments which address our interests with China. 
I fear, Mr. President, that the name change does not accomplish this most important goal; in fact, to the extent that it decreases our resolve to discuss China, this bill jeopardizes our national interests. It is for this reason that I do not join my colleagues today in offering this name-change legislation. 
Instead, I invite the Congress and the President to join me in making the best use of this year's debate. We must utilize this time to develop and advance our China policy, not merely put it off for another year.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce along with my colleague Senator Lieberman the District of Columbia Economic Recovery Act. The social, administrative, and fiscal problems of our Nation's capital are well documented. The District of Columbia is facing its greatest economic crisis since its establishment in 1790. Congress has taken major steps, including the creation of a financial control board, to assist the city during this current financial crisis. Despite efforts by the District's Government and Congress to manage these problems, the city has a long way to go to achieve economic self-sufficiency. 
Mr. President, at the root of the District's problems is an evereroding middle class. Since 1950, Washington's population has declined by nearly 250,000 residents; 68,000 left between 1988 and 1993 alone. The vast majority of these people were middle-class families whose taxes funded the city's operations. Historically, the District of Columbia has tried to offset this decline by raising taxes, leading to even more residents leaving the city in search of lower tax rates, better schools and safer streets. 
We believe that the best way to help the District is to promote economic growth, and the best way to promote economic growth is to significantly reduce the tax burden on its residents. Economic growth will mean more jobs, more opportunity, greater private sector investment and ultimately a better quality of life in the Nation's capital. 
The DCERA is an important step in luring taxpayers back to the District of Columbia. It provides tax incentives, including a 15-percent flat income tax rate for all District resident and deductions of: $15,000 for individual filers; $25,000 for head of household filers; and $30,000 for married filers. 
Many critics of the flat rate argue that it is a bonanza for the rich and the poor, but does little to address the needs of the middle class. We have added several incentives designed specifically to assist the middle class. First, the bill includes a $5,000 first time home buyers' provision designed to assist middle-class families in purchasing homes within the District of Columbia. Second, the bill maintains the current home mortgage and charitable deductions. Finally, we have included a zero capital gains tax rate to help spur investment by District and non-District residents. Middle class residents should benefit significantly from this provision because it encourages them to invest their earnings and it offers a generous reward if and when a middle-class resident sells their homes. Besides these incentives we have included a brownfields provision that encourages companies to clean up environmentally damaged land that is sure to improve the quality of life for District residents and their families. 
This bill also provides an opportunity for all Americans to participate in the economic stability of the District of Columbia by allowing them to have a zero capital gains rate for investments made within the District. We believe that Americans everywhere have great pride in this city and truly want it to represent all the best aspects of this Nation, including a vibrant economy. For too long the city's economy has been linked with the growth and declines of the Federal Government. I believe that the capital gains provisions will encourage nongovernmental economic investment in the District of Columbia. 
Washington, DC is not only home to the people who live here, it is truly the Nation's city. 
We believe that these incentives, along with responsible and sensible financial management, are just what this great city needs to regain its past glory.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues in both the House and Senate, from both sides of the aisle, for their diligent work on S. 717, the IDEA Improvement Act of 1997: Their commitment to ensuring that children with disabilities have continued access to the opportunities and resources essential to becoming independent and contributing members of society. 
Since Congress first enacted legislation to ensure that students with disabilities were no longer denied educational services, few changes have been made. Today, the world is a very different place, and Congress needs to address the issues currently facing both students and educators. These include changes to ensure States have flexibility in using Federal funds; the ability for schools to effectively discipline disruptive children; and provisions to encourage alternative dispute resolution procedures to ensure timely and cost-effective responses to the needs and concerns of parents and administrators. S. 717 accomplishes these important goals. 
Discipline of special education students has been a matter of contention for several years. Currently, except in cases involving firearms, schools are hindered from removing a disabled child from their current educational setting unless the parents of the child agree with the removal decision. Under S. 717, schools can discipline a disabled child just as they would on a nondisabled child if the behavior is determined not to be a manifestation of the child's disability. A hearing officer would then be able to remove the child from his or her current educational placement. This is an important change because, currently, a court injunction is required to remove a dangerous child.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate some very bright and promising students from the State of Florida who visited our Nation's Capitol last week to participate in the `We the People * * *' nationwide championship on the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. I am pleased to announce that students attending the Our Lady of Lourdes Academy in Miami finished in first place. 
At the 3-day competition, students demonstrated their knowledge of the Constitution, U.S. history, and current issues facing our Nation. Their diligent preparation and impressive demonstration of their knowledge propelled them to first place. 
Led by their teacher, Rosie Hefferman, the following students competed on behalf of the Our Lady of Lourdes Academy: Melissa Alvarez, Sonia Borell, Jackie Chisholm, Annette Comas, Caroline DePosada, Dania Fyffe, Vanessa Harries, Jaqui Lage, Carolina Latour, Alicia Llosa, Giselle Perez, Jennifer Rodriguez, and Caroline Ulvert. I would also like to recognize the district coordinator, John Doyle, and the State coordinator, Annette Boyd Pitts. 
I extend my sincere congratulations to these fine students, their families, and their teachers. They worked hard to achieve this impressive goal. Their parents and teachers long realized that education is an investment in our future and critical to our Nation's growth, and these students have acted on that sentiment. Students around the country should view their accomplishment as an inspiration as they seek to achieve their own goals. 
I hope the students from Our Lady of Lourdes Academy enjoyed their experience while visiting Washington, DC, and that they will continue striving to excel in their studies. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan legislation which would allow States to keep almost all of their gas tax revenues for their own transportation projects without interference from Washington. 
The Transportation Empowerment Act--which being re-introduced in the House by Representative John Kasich--would replace the current law governing the Federal highways program, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. 
Under ISTEA, Washington currently collects about $25 billion each year in dedicated transportation taxes, skims money off the top for demonstration projects, skims more off the top to fund its highway bureaucracy, runs the remainder through a maze of formulas, and then returns what's left to the States to fund their transportation programs. 
However, this circle of waste, has shortchanged our Nation's transportation infrastructure. Today, notwithstanding the tremendous growth in spending, our Nation's transportation investment backlog is estimated to be at least $200 billion. This backlog includes the following deficiencies: 25 percent of our highways are in poor/mediocre condition; 24 to 28 percent of bridges are structurally deficient/functionally obsolete; 24 percent of rail transit facilities are in substandard/poor condition; and 20 to 24 percent of transit buses need to be replaced. 
The fact is that our country is getting less from our transportation dollars. Part of the reason for this is reflected in the growth of administrative costs. These costs, as a function of Federal highway construction dollars, have risen from 7 percent in 1956 to over 21 percent today. 
The history of the Federal program has shown us that the current system [ISTEA] of collecting and distributing gas tax dollars needed by States to implement their own transportation needs is too inefficient, too costly, and too bureaucratic. Washington simply can't meet the challenges facing the Nation's infrastructure. 
Simply put: The era of big Government is over. And in this era, the highway system is a perfect example of a program that ought to be returned to the States. It's a simple formula for success--less Washington, more roads. In fact, transportation economists and State officials estimate that if States weren't hamstrung by Washington's arcane formulas and mandates, they could get 20 percent more highways and transit systems for every dollar collected. 
I have introduced the Transportation Empowerment Act because I believe we can better serve our Nation's transportation needs primarily through State run transportation programs, without Federal micromanagement and without laundering gas tax dollars through Washington.

Mr. MACK. I would like to engage the chairman of the committee in a colloquy to further define the purpose of section 2 of the Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act. Section 2 would authorize new disclosure requirements by amending the existing eligibility requirements of HUD's home equity conversion mortgage [HECM] program. The National Housing Act would be amended to ensure that to be eligible for FHA insurance a home equity conversion mortgage shall have been executed by a mortgagor who has received full disclosure of all costs to the mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate planning, financial advice or other related services. 
Is it correct that this section would authorize HUD to require HUD-approved housing counseling agencies and FHA-approved lenders offering the HECM program to ask potential borrowers a series of questions aimed at determining if they have been or are about to be charged unnecessary or excessive fees by a service provider?

 Mr. MACK. Madam President, I am submitting a concurrent resolution today to congratulate the people of Israel and commemorate the 30-year unity of Jerusalem. Jerusalem must remain an undivided city. As a unified city of Israel for the past 30 years, Jerusalem has protected the rights of every ethnic and religious group. This must continue. 
In spite of all that the Congress has done, recent news continues to make reference to Israeli settlements in Jerusalem. Jewish communities and neighborhoods in Jerusalem are not settlements. There is only one Jerusalem, and only one Israel. Jerusalem is an indivisible part of Israel. Israel's friends in Congress understand this. This concurrent resolution is an expression of this support.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, on behalf of Senators D'Amato, Bond, and Bennett, the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. This bill is a serious effort to reform the Nation's assisted and insured multifamily housing portfolio in a responsible manner that balances both fiscal and public policy goals. This legislation will save scarce Federal subsidy dollars while preserving the affordability and availability of decent and safe rental housing for lower income households. 
About 20 years ago, the Federal Government encouraged private developers to construct affordable rental housing by providing mortgage insurance through the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and rental housing assistance through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [HUD] project-based section 8 program. In addition, tax incentives for the development of low-income housing were provided through the Tax Code until 1986. 
This combination of financial incentives resulted in the creation of thousands of decent, safe, and affordable housing properties. However, flaws in the section 8 rental assistance program allowed owners to receive more Federal dollars in rental subsidy than were necessary to maintain the properties as decent and affordable rental housing, and we are beginning to pay the price for excessive rental subsidies. A recent HUD study found that almost two-thirds of assisted properties have comparable rents greater than comparable market rents, in some cases almost 200 percent of area market rents. 
In addition, like the severely distressed public housing stock, some of these section 8 projects have become targets and havens for crime and drug activities. Thus, in some cases, taxpayers are paying costly subsidies for inferior housing. We believe that a policy that pays excessive rental subsidies for housing is not fair to the American taxpayer, nor can it be sustained in the current budget climate. 
It is widely understood that there is a funding crisis in the renewal of HUD's expiring section 8 rental assistance contracts. Indeed, HUD Secretary Cuomo has called the section 8 contract renewal problem `the greatest crisis HUD has ever faced.' The contract renewal problem involves all of HUD's section 8 inventory, both project-based and tenant-based--in all more than 3 million units of low-income housing. The new budget authority needed to renew expiring contracts at current levels will grow from $3.6 billion in the current fiscal year to almost $10 billion in fiscal year 1998 to an estimated $18 billion in fiscal year 2002. 
Over the next several years, a majority of the section 8 contracts on the 8,500 FHA-insured properties will expire. If contracts continue to be renewed at existing levels, the cost of renewing these contracts will grow from about $2 billion in fiscal year 1998 to $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 and more than $7.7 billion 10 years from now. Thus, the project-based section 8 inventory, 
which is addressed in this legislation, is a significant part of the overall section 8 renewal problem. 
The implications of not renewing project-based section 8 contracts are potentially devastating. Without renewals, most of the FHA-insured and section 8-assisted multifamily mortgages--with an unpaid principal balance of $18 billion--will default and result in claims on the FHA insurance funds. This could lead to more severe actions, such as foreclosure, which will adversely affect residents and communities. 
Federally assisted and insured housing serves almost 1.6 million families with an average annual income of $7,000. About half of the households are elderly or contain persons with disabilities. Many of these developments are located in rural areas where no other rental housing exists. Some of these properties serve as anchors of neighborhoods where the economic stability of the neighborhood is dependent on the vitality of these properties. 
The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act addresses the problem of expiring section 8 project-based assistance contracts through a new, comprehensive structure that provides a wide variety of tools to address the spiraling costs of section 8 assistance without harming residents or communities. The bill will reduce the long-term ongoing costs of Federal subsidies by reducing rents to a level that more closely approximates market area rents and restructuring the underlying debt insured by the FHA. The bill also contains a provision that will minimize the potential adverse tax consequences to owners that result from debt restructuring. 
The bill also recognizes that HUD lacks the staffing capacity and expertise to oversee effectively its portfolio of multifamily housing properties or to administer a debt restructuring program. Indeed, one of the principal problems with developing a portfolio restructuring proposal has been the lack of good information on the characteristics or the condition of the properties in FHA's multifamily mortgage portfolio. Accordingly, the bill would transfer the functions and responsibilities of the restructuring program to capable State and local housing finance agencies, who would act as participating administrative entities in managing this program. 
The bill provides incentives to administering entities to ensure that the American taxpayer is paying the least amount of money required to provide decent, safe, and affordable housing. Any amount of incentives provided to State and local entities would only be used for low-income housing purposes. 
Owners who clearly violate housing quality standards would no longer be tolerated. The bill screens out bad owners and managers and nonviable projects from the inventory and provides tougher and more effective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud and abuse of FHA insurance and assisted housing programs. 
Last, the bill provides tools to recapitalize the assisted stock that suffers from deferred maintenance. It provides the opportunity for tenants, local governments, and the community in which the project is located to participate in the restructuring process in a meaningful way. Residents would also be empowered through opportunities to purchase properties. 
Mr. President, I would like to emphasize how important it is to address this issue this year. Delays will only harm the assisted housing stock, its residents and communities, and the financial stability of the FHA insurance funds. I would add that, as we face an explosion in the cost of section 8 contract renewals, we cannot afford to pay more than is reasonable to renew expiring contracts. There is strong support on both sides of the aisle to renew all expiring section 8 contracts next year. But to an extent, the future credibility of the section 8 program, which is so important to 3 million families, depends on our ability to control costs today. 
This legislation will protect the Federal Government's investment in assisted housing and ensure that participating administrative entities are held accountable for their activities. It is also our goal that this process will ensure the long-term viability of these projects with minimal Federal involvement. It is a sincere effort to reduce the cost to the Federal Government while recognizing the needs of low-income families and communities throughout the Nation. 
In closing, I also want to express my hope that the administration will begin to play an active and constructive role in dealing with this section 8 issue. For the last 2 years, we have waited for a concrete administration proposal for portfolio restructuring, but we have received nothing but a series of concept papers and statements of principles. We cannot wait much longer for the administration to come to the table with a serious proposal to deal with a critical budget problem that could affect all of HUD's programs.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution saluting the University of Florida football team on winning the 1996 National Football Championship. 
As a proud alumnus of the University of Florida, I join with all those who have worn the Orange and Blue--both on and off the field--in honoring Coach Steve Spurrier, his staff and the football team for this outstanding accomplishment. 
From its humble beginnings in 1906 to the present, the University of Florida's football program has had a rich and proud history. But 1996 will be forever known in the hearts and minds of the Gator faithful as `The Year of the Gator.' 
From the season opener in `The Swamp' to the national championship title game in the Sugar Bowl, the Gator faithful knew that with Steve Spurrier as their coach and Danny Wuerffel as the team's quarterback, field leader and spiritual leader, the 1996 season would indeed be one to remember. 
The 1996 football team compiled a record of 12 wins and 1 loss and outscored their opponents 611 to 221 points in winning its fourth consecutive SEC championship and its first-ever national football championship. 
For this achievement, the University of Florida was recognized by the Associated Press and major college football coaches as the 1996 national champions. 
This season will also be remembered because for the first time in the history of the Heisman Trophy, an award which is presented annually to college football's most outstanding player, the winner played under a head coach who also had won the Heisman Trophy. Coach Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel should be commended for this high honor. 
It is also important to note that for the first time since the NCAA has been keeping records, two division I college football teams from the same State have played each other for college football's national championship. 
I also want to take this moment to honor Coach Bobby Bowden and the Florida State University football team for their outstanding season and for reaching the national championship game. While they didn't win the game, the Seminoles and their fans should be proud of their achievements and commended for an outstanding season. 
The State of Florida is indeed fortunate to be home to three of the finest college football teams in the Nation: The University of Florida, Florida State University, and the University of Miami. Together these three teams combined have won six college football national championships. 
But in 1996, the national football championship was won by the University of Florida. Not only is this a special accomplishment that will long be remembered by the coaches and players, but it is also a moment to savor for Gator fans. After 90 years of ups and downs, great victories and frustration, the Fightin' Gators are finally the national champions of college football. All the loyal sons and daughters of the University of Florida--wherever they may be--join me today in congratulating Coach Steve Spurrier, his staff, and the 1996 Fightin' Gator football team on winning the 1996 college football's national championship. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the names of the Gator players, coaches, and staff along with their season record and the final polls with the Florida Gators in the top position as the national champions.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with Senator Shelby, which provides real cuts in the capital gains rate and indexes capital gains to account for inflation. As we work to achieve a balanced budget, it is our belief that a real reduction in the capital gains rate is essential to ensure greater growth, innovation, and prosperity. Accordingly, the legislation we have proposed offers the best elements of existing capital gains proposals. 
Perhaps most importantly, this proposal ensures that homeowners, family farms, and small businesses are not penalized for inflationary--phantom--gains by providing for the indexation of capital gains. The importance of indexation is made clear in the accompanying report recently prepared by the Joint Economic Committee. 
Additionally, our bill will offer a 50-percent rate reduction for individuals and corporations, and allow the deduction for a loss on the sale of a principal residence. 
Finally, this legislation encourages investment in small businesses by increasing the exclusion from gains for small business stock from 50 to 75 percent; reducing the requirement for holding stock from 5 to 3 years; increasing the eligibility size to $100 million, and providing a 60-day grace period for the rollover of stock between small businesses. 
Again, I want to restate the importance of a reduced capital gains rate, which benefits all Americans by stimulating economic growth and prosperity and leading to innovation in biomedical research and other life-enhancing technologies. I look forward to my colleagues joining me in this effort to ensure that a real capital gains rate reduction is included in any balanced budget package the Congress puts together in the coming months.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with Senators D'Amato, Bond, Faircloth, and Grams, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This bill is similar to public and assisted housing reform legislation, S. 1260, that was introduced in the 104th Congress and passed unanimously by the Senate. 
The Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 addresses a public housing system fraught with counterproductive rules and regulations that make it impossible for even the best run public housing authorities [PHA's] to operate effectively and efficiently. It will help to make public housing a platform from which residents can achieve the goal of economic independence and self-sufficiency. In addition, it promotes increased residential choice and mobility by increasing opportunities for residents to use tenant-based assistance. 
Most public housing today serves only the poorest of the poor--on average those with incomes at 17 percent of area median. The gap between tenant rent contributions and the cost of operating public housing is growing wider than the ability of Federal housing subsidy funds to close it. PHA's are denied the flexibility necessary to maintain the existing supply of public housing in decent and safe condition, and in some cases are even constrained from demolishing vacant or nonviable public housing developments. 
Just as these rules have made it difficult for housing authorities to provide and maintain decent and safe housing or to meet basic operating costs, these rules have been even worse for tenants. They have destroyed the ability of families to move up and out of public housing and become economically self-sufficient. Public housing rent rules, in particular, create strong economic disincentives for residents to work or seek higher paying jobs. 
The following reforms contained in the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act represent significant improvements in current public and assisted housing policies. 
First, the bill consolidates a multitude of programs into two flexible block grants to expand the eligible uses of funds and allow more creative and efficient use of resources. The bill also repeals a number of current programs that are obsolete, unused, or unfunded. 
Second, it institutes permanent rent reforms such as ceiling rents, earned income adjustments, and minimum rents that provide PHA's with the tools to develop rental policies that encourage and reward work and further the goal of creating mixed-income communities. The bill also removes the floor on rents that may be charged under the Brooke amendment, while assuring that poor families will not pay more than 30 percent of their income for rent. 
Third, the bill requires tough, swift action against PHA's with severe management deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed receivers with the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled agencies and protect public housing residents. 
Fourth, it requires intervention with respect to severely distressed public housing developments that trap residents in deplorable living conditions and are costly to operate or maintain. It provides residents with alternative housing using vouchers or other available housing. 
Fifth, the bill permanently repeals the one-for-one replacement requirement and streamlines the demolition and disposition process to permit PHA's to demolish or sell vacant or obsolete public housing. 
Sixth, it gives PHA's broad flexibility to develop or participate with other providers of affordable housing in the development of mixed-income, mixed finance developments. 
Seventh, it repeals Federal preferences that have had the unintended consequence of concentrating the poorest of the poor in public housing developments and allows PHA's to operate according to locally established preferences consistent with local housing needs. The bill still maintains the requirement that most housing assistance be targeted to very low-income households. 
Eighth, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act calls on PHA's to increase coordination with State and local welfare agencies to ensure that welfare recipients living in public housing will have the full opportunity to move from welfare to work. 
Ninth, the bill provides residents with an active voice in developing the local PHA plans that will govern the operations and management of housing and for direct participation on housing authority boards of directors. It also authorizes funds for resident organizations to develop resident management and empowerment activities. 
Finally, it merges the Section 8 voucher and certificate programs into a single, choice-based program designed to operate more effectively in the private marketplace. It repeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to landlords, such as take-one, take-all, endless lease and 90-day termination notice requirements. These reforms will make participation in the section 8 tenant-based program more attractive to private landlords and increase housing choices for lower income families. 
The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve the nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program and the lives of those who reside in Federally assisted housing. The funding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day operations and policies of public authorities, encouragement of mixed-finance developments, policies to deal with distressed and troubled public housing, and rent reforms will change the face of public housing for PHA's, residents, and local communities. 
Reform of the public housing system has been and should remain a bipartisan effort. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues toward early passage of this legislation.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding to me. 
The question has been asked many times during the day: Do you have the votes? There are 55 Republican Senators who have given their word that they would vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. There are a number of Democrats who have campaigned for this balanced budget amendment. If they keep their word, we will pass this constitutional amendment. 
What is to be gained as a result of doing this? The benefits are to our constituents. We believe that $125 a month could be the benefit derived from a constitutional amendment through lower interest rates, more affordable mortgage loans, more affordable student loans, cheaper automobile loans, and so forth. 
Mr. President, if we were to pass this constitutional amendment, we would finally put some kind of outside restraint on the ability of Congress to spend the taxpayers' dollars. We need to do that. We have failed 28 years in a row. It is time to get it done.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Rockefeller today as we introduce legislation to provide Medicare patients fighting cancer with coverage of benefits when they participate in approved clinical trials. 
Under current law, Medicare will not generally pay for the costs of patient care if they are participating in clinical trials. Beneficiaries are denied access to clinical trials of promising new therapies because Medicare deems these therapies experimental, and therefore not qualified for coverage. This means cancer patients who are Medicare beneficiaries essentially have two choices when they have exhausted all traditional cancer therapies--either pay the costs of participating in a clinical trial themselves, or go without additional treatment. For all but the most wealthy beneficiaries, it is too cost-prohibitive to take part in a clinical trial. 
Clinical trials are one of the most effective ways the Federal Government has of determining which treatments are most effective. Yet, researchers have told me they have difficulty accruing the required number of patients to participate in the trials they are conducting. Researchers have identified noncoverage by Medicare and private insurers as one of the primary reasons why patients do not participate in clinical trials. At a time when American researchers are making such tremendous progress in cancer genetics and cancer biology, it is essential that this knowledge be translated into new therapies through well-designed clinical trials. This legislation will help enhance our research efforts by facilitating broad patient participation in important cancer clinical trials. 
Our legislation is limited to only the highest-quality clinical trials. Only those trials which have undergone the rigors of peer-review will be considered. These include trials approved by the National Institutes of Health [NIH], the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, or organizations which are approved by the NIH, such as the American Cancer Society. 
Like most of my colleagues, I am very reluctant to introduce legislation to expand Medicare at a time when the report of the Board of Trustees of Social Security and Medicare clearly shows that Medicare is going broke. My support of such legislation is conditional upon the added benefit providing a clear and needed service at no significant cost to taxpayers. 
The legislation we introduce today does not add to Medicare's basic benefit package, but merely provides coverage for routine patient costs which Medicare is already obligated to reimburse when provided outside a clinical trial. Medicare will not be responsible for paying for research or new pharmaceutical products. In addition, Medicare beneficiaries will still be responsible for meeting deductibles and copayment requirements traditionally required by Medicare. Because these beneficiaries are cancer patients, they are already receiving, or will receive in the future, many of the medical services covered by this legislation. 
Finally, this is a true demonstration program. In 2002, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must submit a report to Congress detailing any cost increases to the Medicare program and provide projects for future expenditures, if the program continues. Congress can then decide, based upon these data and any hearings which may take place, whether to enact legislation to make coverage of cancer clinical trials permanent. 
Therefore, I am convinced this legislation meets my two criteria for expanding Medicare. First, there is an indisputable urgent need for this benefit and, second, I believe it will not add significantly to the costs of the Medicare system. In fact, the information we learn from these clinical trials may provide us with more cost-effective means of treating cancer patients. 
As I have mentioned to my colleagues before, many members of my family have battled cancer. As a family, we have worked extensively with numerous cancer organizations. As a Senator, I have met with thousands of cancer patients throughout Florida and the rest of the United States. They have told me how important it is that patients themselves, not the Government, be responsible for making treatment decisions with their physicians. Patients desperately want to participate in clinical trials when traditional therapies are no longer beneficial. The legislation which Senator Rockefeller and I introduce today, which has the enthusiastic support of cancer patient, physician, nurse, and research organizations, will empower cancer patients with more treatment choices in a cost-effective manner. 
I want to commend Senator John Rockefeller for his leadership in bringing this issue to the forefront. Senator Rockefeller has always been there for cancer patients, as evidenced by his landmark 1993 legislation which provided Medicare coverage of anticancer drugs. We've worked together on cancer issues on several occasions over the years, and it's always a pleasure to work with him. 
Mr. President, our legislation would provide cancer patients who are Medicare participants with an additional choice at a time when a clinical trial may be their best, or only, hope for survival. I therefore urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Medicare Cancer Clinical Trial Program Coverage Act of 1997.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague for allowing me to take this time to address the Senate on the issue of the balanced budget amendment. 
I have spoken many times in the past years on this issue, both in the House and here in the Senate. I think it is a vital one. It is truly a debate about whether we are committed to the belief that the era of big Government is over. The reason there is such a debate about this issue is because it really is fundamental to that. 
Before I make some additional comments I think I might just make a statement or two with respect to the issue of Social Security. I represent the State of Florida, and therefore I think it is fair to say I am pretty sensitive to the retiree, the elderly vote in my State and their concerns about Social Security. I make the claim that probably the most significant way to protect Social Security is, in fact, to pass a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
My feeling is that, in fact, it is a risky gimmick, I think, to be taking Social Security off budget. For that matter, I think it is to be proposing that a whole series of programs be taken off budget. We need to address the balanced budget constitutional amendment from the standpoint of all the expenditures, all the income and all the expenditures of the Federal Government, not separating them off into different accounts and considering only one group of expenditures at a time. Again, I think it is a risky gimmick to take Social Security off budget. 
Mr. President, over the last couple years I had the opportunity to read several books on the Constitution. One written by Catherine Drinker Bowen, and maybe this comes back to my mind after having watched the special on Thomas Jefferson that was on PBS last week. I thought it was a terrific 3-hour presentation and discussion about the roots of our Government, the roots of this Nation. Catherine Drinker Bowen's book, called `Miracle at Philadelphia,' was all about the debate about the establishment of the Constitution. I know that some have said, `Well, the Constitution did not have a balanced budget amendment or a balanced budget requirement as part of it.' Therefore, people would make the claim if they did not feel it was important then, and they were certainly some of the brightest minds we have ever experienced in Government, who are we to claim that there needs to be an amendment to the Constitution to address this issue, the need for a balance within our expenditures? 
I think that the people who make that claim fail to take into consideration how our Constitution has been amended over the years and the fact that the Senate used to be appointed. I believe it was either in 1912 or 1916--I have forgotten the specific date--when the Constitution was changed to require a direct vote on Members of the Senate. Well, there was an intricate balance that the writers of the Constitution came up with that was changed, with the result of the Senate being directly elected by the people. If you will remember, the fear that many had in those days was that the House, directly elected by the people, would be off pursuing many different ideas of great popular support, and that there needed to be some kind of restraint that would be placed on the people's House, and that would come from the Senate. Again, that has been changed. So some of the restraint was built into the system to be able to say, no, we don't think we ought to pursue that particular program or that particular expenditure. That was taken out as a result of the change in the direct election of Members of the U.S. Senate. 
I think it is fair to say that we ought to address the particular point that, today, there is a tendency to think of this debate as being a debate about economics. The reality is this is about human behavior and how we are going to control the desire on the part of some people to support all the different initiatives that might come from our constituents. So I think, from a constitutional perspective, one can say that the conditions have changed significantly, to the point where it is completely legitimate to be arguing today that we need an outside restraint on the ability of the Members of the Congress to spend our taxpayers' dollars. I have supported the constitutional amendment since I have entered Congress, which was back in 1982. 
I want to take just a moment or two to talk about the benefits that are derived. Again, all too often we find ourselves talking about some very intricate aspect of this debate, and we fail to address what I believe are the important benefits that come from a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, a requirement that we balance the budget. I believe, in the long term, we will end up with lower taxes, higher growth, more jobs, less Government, and lower interest rates. 
Again, lower interest rates can, I think, produce some very tangible benefits to our constituents. We have made estimates, for example, that lower interest rates would save the average family $125 a month. Now, some people might say that is not a great deal of money. I say to my colleagues, then go stand out in front of a grocery store and ask the individuals coming out whether they think an extra $125 a month is meaningful. I believe it is. We believe the way they can save that kind of money is, again, because of lower interest rates. Mortgage payments would be lower, automobile loans would be less expensive, student loans would be more affordable. That is a direct benefit that is passed on to our constituents. 
Again, I have a tendency to think at this time about the kinds of people that will be affected by what we do. I again ask my colleagues to consider the folks back home--the mother who might have two jobs who is being asked to support funding of all these various programs at the Federal level, the family where the husband and wife both work. In fact, I remember one particular individual coming up to me and explaining that he works all week and comes home and takes care of the children over the weekends while his wife works over the weekend. These are the kinds of people who we are asking to pay taxes to the Federal Government to fund the various programs. I can only think of one way we can finally put some restraint, again, on the Members' ability to spend their money, and that is to pass a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
At this point, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. MACK. Mr. President, 1 year ago today, Fidel Castro brutally murdered Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la PenAE6a, Carlos Costa, and Pablo Morales--three Americans and one a legal U.S. resident. These men were shot down while flying on a humanitarian mission over international waters between the United States and Cuba. 
This incident was the latest in Fidel Castro's reign of tyranny over the people of Cuba. The unjustified downing of the two brothers to the rescue planes came shortly after Fidel Castro had stopped a prodemocracy and human rights meeting in Havana. Dozens of prodemocracy Cubans were arrested, detained, and harassed. Just the year before, on March 13, 1994, a tugboat brimming with freedom-seeking Cubans headed for America was rammed by Castro's government ships until it sank. Some 40 people died, only because they yearned to be free. Year after year, Fidel Castro's Cuba tightens the stranglehold it has on basic political and economic freedom. 
To those who believe in the cause of Cuban freedom--in libertad--it is unfortunate that it took an act of such callous disregard for human life and freedom to get the world to pay attention to Fidel Castro's repression of the Cuban people. 
As we honor the memory of the downed pilots today, we should take time to reflect upon the current state of United States policy toward Cuba. We must ask ourselves--are we doing everything we can to isolate Fidel and to save the Cuban people from the jaws of tyranny? I believe the answer is, unequivocally, no. 
After the attack on the American pilots, President Clinton appeared to reverse his policy of appeasement toward Fidel Castro by signing the Helms-Burton legislation. Unfortunately, the administration's actions since the signing have been weaker than the President's rhetoric. 
First, the President has failed to stand firm in the defense of freedom--not once, but twice. He has chosen to protect the interests of foreign companies over the cause of Cuban freedom by postponing implementation of a key part of the Helms-Burton law. He has unilaterally placed a moratorium on the right of U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies that profit from property those citizens owned before Fidel Castro stole it. 
Second, after the downing of the brothers to the rescue aircraft, President Clinton promised compensation to the families of the victims and criminal indictments against those in Cuba responsible for the murders. On March 7, 1996, then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, along with myself and Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen sent a letter to President Clinton urging him to `immediately direct the Attorney General to seek the indictment of all those responsible for the heinous crime of February 24, 1996.' Now a year later, the families still have not been fully compensated and the Cuban officials who committed these murders are still free. 
For the sake of the people of Cuba, Mr. President, the United States cannot waiver in its commitment to bringing an end to Castro's rule. If we demand of other nations that they not do business with the Castro government, then we must demand of ourselves a steadfast policy of concrete action, not just empty words. 
America must do everything we can to bring freedom and democracy to Cuba--not just for the benefit of Cubans, but to protect the security of Americans. 
Mr. President, it is with this commitment to action that I offer the following five points to bring freedom and democracy to Cuba, and I call on the President to take these steps without delay. 
First, Fidel Castro must be exposed for what he really is--an authoritarian dictator worried only about maintaining power at any expense. The Cuban people have a word for this called desenmascarar, which means to remove the mask. We need to remove the mask of Fidel Castro as a romantic and cigar-smoking friend; he is a murderer and drug trafficker; and he tortures and imprisons political dissidents. 
Second, we must reverse our policy since 1995 of returning freedom-seeking Cuban refugees and political dissidents to Cuba, and promote the same level of compassion among our allies and friends around the world. At a time when our own State Department classifies Cuba as one of the greatest violators of human rights in the world, it is unconscionable for the President to order the return of these brave people back into the hands of their oppressor. In addition, we should encourage our friends and allies to exhibit the same level of compassion in dealing with the suffering Cuban people. We should further promote the efforts of the United Nations and the International Committee for the Red Cross in gaining access to Cuba. 
Third, we must increase our efforts to support and encourage Cuba's budding civil society. This is best accomplished by increasing support for pro-freedom and democracy groups through the National Endowment for Democracy and other effective groups dedicated to democratic reforms. 
Fourth, military and nuclear subsidies to Cuba must be halted. Fidel currently benefits economically from the presence of the Russian intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. In addition, International Atomic Energy Agency money is being spent to maintain the Juragua nuclear power plant, in contradiction to current United States policy. 
Fifth, stop the flow of drugs from Cuba. For the past several decades, Cuba has served as a transhipment point for narcotics entering the United States. Castro uses this drug flow as a means of acquiring much needed cash and as a weapon against the United States. High-ranking members of the Castro government benefit from this source of revenue and several are currently under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking charges. 
If we implement these specific actions identified in my five points and insist upon executing the strategy mandated by Congress in Helms-Burton of isolating Castro and supporting the Cuban people, we can hope for a free and democratic Cuba. 
Mr. President, I would conclude my remarks with a plea to those who would appease Fidel Castro. Castro heads a government which denies basic freedoms to 11 million people. Fidel Castro will not change. His only interest is the perpetuation of his totalitarianism. He continues to force his people to work for slave wages; he denies them the freedom to read and speak freely, to associate freely, and to work hard and profit from their effort and intellect so that their children can live better lives. 
Over the years I have consistently said that freedom is the core of all human progress. Mr. President, on the anniversary of the downing of the brothers to the rescue pilots, let us honor their memory by fulfilling their commitment--and our American commitment--to a free and democratic Cuba.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, in 1993, the National Cancer Institute rescinded its recommendation that all women in their forties undergo mammography screening for breast cancer. Since then, American women have been receiving mixed messages about the importance of mammography. 
Women are confused. Women are angry. Women are frightened. Given the wide variety of recommendations being made about mammography screening for younger women, one can certainly understand why. 
The scientific community is deeply divided on the interpretation of data from mammography clinical trials conducted in the United States and elsewhere. Cancer advocacy organizations are split on the proper recommendations to give their members and the public. Physicians want to provide the best recommendations to their patients, but there is no single answer to give them. Insurance companies frequently deny coverage of benefits unless there is compelling scientific data to warrant coverage. 
Clearly, women want to be more involved in making health care decisions for themselves. But when the medical, scientific, and patient advocacy communities cannot agree on the issue of mammography screening, women are being placed in a situation where they must make, at best, an educated guess as to what they should do to protect themselves from a disease which will kill an estimated 44,000 women this year. 
Women and their families were hopeful they would get clear answers when the National Institutes of Health convened the Consensus Development Conference on Breast Cancer Screening for Women Ages 40-49. 
Unfortunately, the Consensus Development Conference statement contains more mixed messages, more confusing data and few real answers. 
The report concludes, `zero to 10 women would have their lives extended per 10,000 women ages 40-49 who are regularly screened. About 2,500 women should be screened regularly in order to extend one life.' These two statements leave a great deal of room for interpretation by women, their physicians and their families. 
The report concludes, `up to 25 percent of all breast cancer is not detected by mammogram in women ages 40-49.' One could therefore logically conclude that 75 percent of all breast cancer is detected by mammography performed on women in this age group. To me, the fact that 75 percent of breast cancers will be detected through mammography is very significant. In addition, this conclusion also makes a compelling case for additional research to develop more sophisticated equipment which can detect breast cancer earlier than today's mammography technology can. 
The report also concludes that use of mammography has contributed to a growing trend that breast cancer tumors are being detected when they are small, and at an early stage. The report states that, `the presence of smaller or earlier stage breast tumors can give a patient more choice in selecting among various treatment options.' Research has shown that lumpectomy, combined with radiation therapy, is as effective as mastectomy when the tumor is detected early. 
One area all parties involved in this issue can agree upon is the need for additional research. I have introduced Senate Resolution 15, to express the sense of the Senate that funding for biomedical research activities of the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over the next 5 fiscal years. It is only through research that definitive answers to these very important research questions can be obtained. 
While I respect the conclusions of the consensus panel, I believe the message being sent to younger women throughout America is wrong. They are being told, in essence, that early detection of breast cancer may not be all that important. I believe most women reject that conclusion. 
On numerous occasions, I have spoken about how my own family has been affected by cancer. My wife and my mother are both survivors of breast cancer because it was detected at an early stage. It haunts me to think what might have happened if they had received the message that women are currently receiving with this report. 
I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I believe it is important that the Senate send the message that more research is needed to further determine the benefits of mammography screening in younger women, that the National Cancer Institute should reconsider its mammography screening guidelines, and to encourage the public to consider cancer screening guidelines issued by other organizations.  
Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I will take just a couple of minutes to explain this resolution and also the motivation, if you will. 
The Senate resolution calls for doubling the investment in medical research at the National Institutes of Health over the next 5 years. There are many, many motivations for doing this. As most of my colleagues know, both my wife and I are survivors of cancer, Priscilla with breast cancer; I am a melanoma survivor. 
In my quest to gain more knowledge about the various weapons that might be at our disposal to fight this disease and to hope that someday we can find a series of cures. I have also had the opportunity to listen to research scientist in many different areas, many different diseases, whether that be Parkinson's disease, whether that be diabetes, whether that be in spinal cord injuries, in the area of cancer, prostate, breast cancer, melanoma, and so forth. 
There was a hearing held at the end of the last Congress by now retired Senator Mark Hatfield and Senator Bill Cohen. There were a number of individuals who testified at that hearing and made, I thought, a remarkable case about why it was no longer acceptable for the Congress of the United States, for the Federal Government to continue a kind of business-as-usual attitude with respect to medical research, biomedical research. One of the individuals who spoke to us, Joan Samuelson, speaking about Parkinson's disease, said: 
The current Federal policy on Parkinson's wastes billions in public and private dollars coping with its effects, when millions could simply cure it. 
I remember vividly the testimony of Travis Roy, a young man who today is a quadriplegic, the result of an injury during an ice hockey game. Part of his testimony was that he dreams in essence for the day when he can hug his mother again. 
Now, if that statement had been made before a hearing of the Congress 20, 25, 30 years ago, the response pretty much would have been that we all certainly could understand the hurt that this individual and this family has experienced. Most of us probably would have concluded, well, but there is nothing that we can do. To put more money into research of a problem we all know; we can remember those stories about spinal cord injuries years ago--there is no way to find a cure. 
The reality is in America today, this Nation happens to believe that in all areas, or in so many different areas of diseases we are on the verge of discovering many cures, that we can no longer take this attitude of business as usual, and that if we make the investment in research we can in fact find ways to solve these problems, and to find cures, and, most importantly, to offer hope to our loved ones. 
So I have introduced S. 15. I know there will be people, for example, who will say, `Well, Senator, you are taking about spending more money.' Yes, I am talking about spending more money, but it is an area in which I believe the Federal Government should be more active, and I believe it is an area where we will get a major return for it. In response to a question just recently about budget matters, my reaction was stop and calculate what we have saved as a Nation as a result of finding the cure for polio. In my view, there is no reason why we cannot today operate from the perspective that there are cures out there if we could just provide the resources to our research scientists around this Nation. I am confident we can succeed, and I must say, Mr. President, I stand here today filled with joy, with the recognition that so many of my colleagues feel the same as I. I am confident again, if we make this investment, we can offer great hope to so many millions of Americans. 
I thank the Chair.
