Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration of my colleague, the Senator from Ohio. I had planned to yield to the majority leader. He had said that he was going to return to finish his wrapup. And, indeed, if he is ready to do so now, I will yield; otherwise, I will take advantage of this opportunity to make a few comments about the vote that we concluded this morning.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the omnibus appropriations bill that we approved this morning. It was roughly a $500 billion omnibus appropriations bill. And I would like to begin by saying that I am thankful that we did not shut down the Federal Government to resolve our spending differences this year. That was clearly a failed approach that disillusioned our Nation and unjustly punished the dedicated Federal employees who serve the American people. But I also have to say I have enormous concern with how we got here, and with some of the consequences of the road we traveled. 
Like every one of our colleagues, I am pleased with many aspects of this bill, but disappointed with other aspects. I am pleased that we finally achieved justice for farmers who face racial discrimination at the USDA, that we have acted decisively to strengthen our Nation's defenses, that we have invested substantially in improving the education of our children, that we have refrained--for now at least--from interfering in the local operation of our region's airports, 
and that we were able to eliminate some of the most egregious anti-environmental riders. 
I'm disappointed that we abandoned fiscal discipline and avoided, once again, making the tough choices to pay for our priorities. Instead, we spent $21 plus billion of the so-called `surplus,' which we should be saving to protect Social Security, and we failed to enact another round of base closures to help fund needed military readiness improvements. I'm also disappointed that we couldn't make the cuts necessary to find the funds needed to help localities that are struggling to modernize their schools. 
Mostly I'm disappointed by the process that led us to an up or down vote, with virtually no debate, on eight separate annual spending bills consolidated into a giant roughly $500 billion package that funds nearly one third of our government. Mr. President, we have a obligation to debate our priorities in the open and make the tough decisions, just like American families are required to do every day. 
I believe this process amounts to a dereliction of our duty as representatives of the people. While I appreciate the hard work of the appropriations committees, this all-encompassing appropriations bill has ultimately been the work product of too few people with no realistic opportunity for amendment. Members were left to hope that their interests, and the interests of those they represent, were being advanced. This is heavy burden to ask the appropriations committee and the leadership to bear, and we shouldn't be placing them in that position. 
We should be able to debate, and vote, about whether funds should be spent on improving our system of education, and about how they should be spent. 
We should be able to debate, and vote, about how to remedy racial discrimination in the federal government. And we should able to debate, and vote, about the best way to protect the environment. 
But instead of the open debate we need, instead of the careful consideration by each and every member of the public policy consequences that affect our states and nation, we have what amounts to a take-it-or-leave-it appropriations bill that will, again, fund nearly one-third of the federal government. 
There's no question, Mr. President, that there are times when a take-it-or-leave it approach is necessary. I support, for example, the base closure process because it is the only mechanism we have devised which forces members of Congress to vote for the politically unpopular closure of unnecessary military facilities. And in order to maintain our role as the world's sole remaining superpower, the need to undertake another round of base closures to increase funding in critical areas will become an imperative. I also support take-it-or-leave-it fast track trade authority to promote free trade because it's the only way other governments will negotiate with us that can achieve meaningful results. 
But when it comes to deciding our priorities in federal spending, we need a more open and rational process. Each year that we proceed in this fashion, I become more convinced that we should follow the lead of many states, like my own, Virginia, and undertake biennial budgeting. We should alternate a year of appropriations with a year of oversight. Just today, I signed onto an effort by Senator Domenici to institute biennial budgeting. 
Due to our failure to pass a budget resolution this year, we have been guided in large part by the balanced budget agreement we reached two years ago. I supported that agreement, because when I came to the Senate in 1988, one of my highest priorities was fighting for fiscal responsibility. 
But the problems we've encountered this year in passing our appropriations bills stem directly from the unrealistic goals we established in the balanced budget agreement. We all but ignored the 800 pound gorilla sitting in the room--entitlement spending--and instead focused on reducing our investments through future cuts in discretionary spending. 
I certainly support weeding out unnecessary discretionary spending, which is why I support the line-item veto, but effectively lowering discretionary caps in real terms, without regard to where those cuts might fall, is not the wisest approach. 
The discretionary caps we established in 1997 did not require that tough decisions be made. It merely left to a future Congress the difficult choices in dividing a shrinking pie. We are now that `future Congress' and we're having a difficult time reaping what we have sewn. So we cut `phantom' future investments to preserve current consumption spending. But to reduce federal spending, and to someday reduce the national debt, we really need to reform entitlement programs. And the longer we wait, the more difficult the task will become. 
So while I'm pleased that we reached our destination, I'm extremely disappointed with the road we took to get here. And I hope that during the next Congress, we will work to improve the appropriations process, to get our fiscal work done on time and in the open, and to begin the enormous task of reforming entitlement programs and saving Social Security by making the tough choices. 
Mr. President, I reluctantly supported the appropriations bill today because, while the process that produced the bill is a terrible one, the failure to enact the bill would have been far worse. Without this bill there would have been another government shutdown, and the funds wouldn't be there to bolster our military, improve the education of our children, and render long-denied justice for those who've suffered discrimination. Despite all the benefits this bill will provide, however, I strongly object to violating our fiscal discipline and spending $21 billion of the surplus, which will ultimately make the job of saving Social Security more difficult. 
Next year, we've got to do better. 
With that, Mr. President, I wish our departing colleagues well during our adjournment and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the Senate's attention to a matter of concern to the government of the District of Columbia and to commuters in the capital area. 
Each workday, about one thousand people a day use an informal carpool system to get in and out of the nation's capital. These commuters gather in `slug lines' at unofficial pick up points to catch rides with others driving into the District. At the end of the day, these `slugs' catch rides home. 
Nearly everyone benefits from this system. The drivers get to work more quickly because they get to use the carpool lane. The `slugs' get a free ride. Other drivers benefit from reduce traffic. And all of us benefit from less pollution due to increased carpooling. 
Not everyone is happy with the slugs however. The District of Columbia police have raised concerns that drivers picking up slugs will slow traffic or create a safety hazard. As reported in recent articles in the Washington Post, city police officers have ticketed these drivers and considered forcing the commuters to find a new pick up point. Fortunately, District Police Chief Ramsey has decided against his approach. Instead, he will study the traffic situation along 14th Street to see how we can improve the flow of traffic. 
I welcome this approach. We may be able to address the District's concerns about safety and traffic congestion while preserving the slug lines. I've asked the managers of the legislation to consider this problem during conference, and if possible, to include language directing the Department of the Interior and the District of Columbia Department of Public Works to study the feasibility of providing commuter pick-up lanes to serve commuters in the busy 14th Street Corridor south of Constitution Avenue. The Interior Department and the District would report to the Appropriations Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on their joint recommendations to address this matter. Even if conference report language could not be included, I believe the idea of the study, with recommendations would be helpful. 
I would like to emphasize that many of these commuters are Federal employees, and so I think it's appropriate to get the federal government involved. I am certainly willing to work with the District Government to seek federal funds or easements to create commuter pick up lanes, and I hope the District will look closely at this option. I think it could be a triple play--a win with respect to the District's safety concerns, a win for drivers on our congested highways, and of course, a win for the slugs. 
Mr. President, I would appreciate hearing the comments of the joint managers on this issue, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will help clean up and restore our nation's waters. This bill, the National Clean Water Trust Fund Act of 1998, creates a trust fund from fines, penalties and other monies collected through enforcement of the Clean Water Act. The money deposited into the National Clean Water Trust Fund would be used to address the pollution problems that initiated those enforcement actions. 
Last year, a highly publicized case in Virginia illustrated the need for this legislation. On August 8, 1997, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Smith issued a $12.6 million judgement, the largest fine ever levied for violations of the Clean Water Act, against Smithfield Foods, Isle of Wright County, Virginia, for polluting the James River. The Judge wrote in her opinion that the civil penalty imposed on Smithfield should be directed toward the restoration of the Pagan and James Rivers, tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, due to current federal budget laws, the court had no discretion over the damages, and the fine was deposited into the Treasury's general fund, defeating the very spirit of the Clean Water Act. 
Today, there is no guarantee that fines or other money levied against parties who violate provisions in the Clean Water Act will be used to correct water problems. Instead, some, if not all, of the money is directed into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury with no provision that it be used to improve the quality of our water. While the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement activities are extracting large sums of money from industry and others through enforcement of the Clean Water Act, we ignore the fundamental issue of how to pay for clean up and restoration of pollution problems for which the penalties were levied. To ensure the successful implementation of the Clean Water Act, we should put these enforcement funds to work and actually clean up our nation's waters. 
This legislation will establish a National Clean Water Trust Fund within the U.S. Treasury to earmark fines, penalties, and other funds, including consent decrees, obtained through enforcement of the Clean Water Act that would otherwise be placed into the Treasury's general fund. Within the provisions of the bill, the EPA Administrator would be authorized, with direct consultation from the states, to prioritize and carry out projects to restore and recover waters of the United States using the funds collected from violations of the Clean Water Act. This legislation, however, would not preempt citizen suits or in any way preclude EPA's authority to undertake and complete supplemental environmental projects as part of settlements related to violations of the Clean Water Act and/or other legislation. The bill also provides court discretion over civil penalties from Clean Water Act violations to be used to carry out mitigation and restoration projects. With this legislation, we can avoid another predicament like the one faced in Virginia. 
Mr. President, it only makes sense that fines occurring from violations of the Clean Water Act be used to clean up and restore the waters that were damaged. This bill provides a real opportunity to improve the quality of our nation's waters. 
I recognize that no action can be taken on this legislation this session. I introduce it today in order to give my colleagues, the Administration and others an opportunity to examine the ideas contained in the legislation. I will introduce this legislation early in the next Congress and hope we can include it in the reauthorization of the Clean Water Act when it is taken up next year.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today expressing the Sense of the Senate regarding a heinous crime affecting a family in Virginia and a growing problem in this country. 
According to Department of Justice statistics, 114,600 children are the subject of an abduction attempt by a stranger each year, and 12 children are actually abducted by a stranger every day. The statistics on child abductions by non-custodial parents is even more alarming, with 983 abductions each and every day. 
I believe that we, as members of Congress, as parents, and as concerned citizens of this country, should use all available resources in an exhaustive effort to locate missing and abducted children. 
Today, through this Sense of the Senate resolution, I seek to bring to your attention the plight of Ms. Maureen Dabbagh of Virginia Beach. Ms. Dabbagh has not seen her daughter, Nadia, in five years. At the age of three, Mr. Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh illegally abducted Nadia and fled the United States. He is wanted on state and federal warrants in connection with this abduction and he has been the subject of an international `wanted' notice since 1996. Since the abduction, Ms. Dabbagh has not seen or heard from her child. She has been aided in her ordeal by many caring people, groups and government agencies, however, to this day, Nadia still has not been returned to her mother. 
Mr. President, I greatly sympathize with the plight of Maureen Dabbagh and other parents facing similar situations. I wish to redouble all efforts to bring Nadia home.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to express my surprise and dismay about what occurred in the conference committee on the agriculture appropriations bill. 
During debate on this bill in July, Mr. President, the Senate accepted an amendment I offered to waive the statute of limitations for discrimination complaints filed by many small and minority farmers against the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This amendment addresses an urgent and shameful problem, Mr. President, and we worked with farmers, the White House, the USDA, the Department of Justice, and the Congressional Black Caucus to develop language that would protect the legal rights of farmers' and be implementable by USDA. 
Mr. President, similar language was included in the House bill, but it was drafted more quickly and with less consensus. It was more narrowly defined and had less aggressive time limits for USDA to resolve discrimination complaints. And it cost $5 million less. 
And even though Representative Maxine Waters, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus lobbied the conferees in support of the Senate version of this amendment, Mr. President, the Senate lost on almost all counts. 
To give my colleagues some background, the investigative unit at USDA's Office of Civil Rights was abolished in 1983. Farmers whose complaints were pending at the time were led to believe their complaints were still being investigated, when they were not. Farmers who filed complaints after the abolition of the unit were also led to believe that their complaints would be processed and investigated, despite the fact that the USDA had no resources with which to conduct such investigations. The bottom line is that none of these complaints were ever considered--but none of the farmers were told that was the case. 
When Secretary Glickman learned of this problem, Mr. President, he directed that the complaints be resolved quickly. In fact, I offered an amendment to last year's appropriations bill to fund the investigative unit. 
But when USDA was finally prepared to enter into settlement agreements on some of these cases, Mr. President, the Department of Justice stepped in to claim that the statute of limitations for the complaints--despite USDA's deception in the matter--had expired. The amendment I offered to this year's appropriations bill eliminates this legal obstacle and allows farmers to pursue their claims of discrimination. It allows them to have their day in court, so to speak. 
As we approached conference, however, I learned through staff that objections to accepting the Senate version of this amendment were raised based on cost. Our version was scored at $15 million, while the House version was scored at $10 million. Mr. President, there's no question the two amendments were slightly different. But the $15 million in the 
Senate amendment was to compensate Americans for discrimination perpetuated by their own government. It was a figure determined by CBO, conferring with USDA, about which of the pending complaints would have likely resulted in legitimate and provable cases of government discrimination. It is money that our government owes to farmers who have been treated in such an unjust and morally reprehensible manner. 
Mr. President, during conference deliberations, I learned that the House conferees objected to the scope of the Senate amendment. As I've alluded to before, the House version addressed only discrimination complaints against the Farm Service Agency. My amendment addressed complaints filed against not only the Farm Service Agency, but also the Rural Housing Service. We know that discrimination has occurred in both agencies, and study after study has clearly illustrated this. Unless we address complaints against both agencies, we allow justice to continue to elude a number of minority farmers in America who deserve at long last to be treated fairly. 
To my dismay, Mr. President, the conferees accepted the House version of the civil rights amendment, adding only a small portion of the Senate version. 
The Senate version of the civil rights amendment allowed for the waiver of the statute of limitations for discrimination complaints made against both the Farm Service Agency and the Rural Housing Service. The House version only allowed the FSA claims. 
While the conference language allows farmers to file suit in federal court if their claims for relief are denied by USDA, the Senate language specified that the federal court shall apply a de novo standard of review. This standard would have allowed a federal court to review USDA's findings and rationales with a fresh eye, so to speak. In other words, a court would not be required to give as much deference to USDA's decisions. This is obviously a protection that would have given aggrieved farmers a degree of legal protection that is imminently justified. Yet no such protection exists in the conference language. 
To make matters worse, Mr. President, the one protective provision that I was told would be included in the conference language--the expedited review provision--was somehow omitted from the conference report. When the conferees reached a compromise on this amendment, it is my understanding that they specifically agreed to include a provision of my amendment which limited USDA to 180 days in which to investigate complaints, issue findings, and propose settlement awards, where applicable. This provision was supposed to be included, but it was not. 
Mr. President, I am at a loss to explain why we can't do a better job of rectifying such a grevious history of overt, admitted discrimination for so little money. Our Minority farmers 
deserved better conference language from this Congress than they got. It just underscores the enormous obstacle we face in resolving this issue--and that is that too few members care enough about this problem to give it the attention and the priority it calls for. 
Before I conclude, Mr. President, I'd like to share with my colleagues some updated news. Last week, the Office of Inspector General issued a report which lambasted the Office of Civil Rights' handling of the backlog of discrimination complaints. The report characterized the Office's case files as `too slovenly to ensure the availability of critical documents.' It further berated the Office for its failure to implement the majority of recommendations made to the Department in a February 1997 report. 
I am not sure why this Department has had so many problems, not only with eliminating unjust and inexcusable behavior, but also with efficiently resolving complaints of discrimination. These are symptoms of an overwhelming and inexcusable problem. As many of my colleagues know, this is a problem that I have been working to solve for almost two years, from the moment it was first brought to my attention by a group of minority farmers headed by a Virginian. 
Mr. President, I have heard account after account of inexcusable behavior on the part of various officials at USDA, primarily those in positions of authority who process farmers' applications for loans. Some farmers have had trouble even getting loan applications, much less having their applications processed in a timely manner. Many farmers have cited stories in which their applications have been purposely processed later than those of non-minority farmers. The loan money then, in effect, was dispersed to non-minority farmers first. Then, when many minority farmers checked the status of their applications, the USDA officials responded by stating that there wasn't any money left. Another farmer told me that a USDA official was permitted to keep a noose in his office, despite repeated complaints about the message it sent to minority farmers wishing to do business in that office. 
I know that Secretary Glickman is committed to stemming this pattern, but ultimately Congress is responsible for overseeing our government agencies. In the two years that I've been working on this issue, talking with farmers, meeting with the Secretary and the President, we, as a Congress, have not taken a sufficiently forceful approach to stem this shameful pattern of discrimination. In my view, that makes us part of the problem as well. 
When the conferees chose not to accept the Senate language, they made a choice that sends a disquieting message to minority farmers across this country. The message they sent was that they were willing to do the bare minimum for minority farmers who have suffered discrimination at the hands of government officials. It is a message that we, the Congress, are not willing to get fully invested in eliminating discrimination within our own government. 
The President has indicated that he will veto this bill, and I am hopeful that my colleagues will take another opportunity to look at the differences between the Senate language and the conference language. We will have another opportunity to correct a critical error in our priorities. The farmers deserve our best oversight efforts, and they deserve the strongest civil rights amendment that we can craft. I will continue to push all of our colleagues to do so. A lack of attention to this issue means not only failure on our part, but a perpetuation of a problem for which we should all be ashamed.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, several months ago, one of my constituents, Ms. Llewellyn Hedgbeth of Arlington, Virginia, contacted my office to request my intervention in a matter which has brought considerable anguish and frustration to her family. 
It so happened that Ms. Hedgbeth's father, Mr. Roger A. Hedgbeth, Sr., a decorated veteran of World War II, and a career civil servant, had recently passed away. Before his death, however, he made two simple requests: one, that his body be donated to science, and two, that his ashes be placed at Arlington National Cemetery. His widow, now 71, honored the first of those wishes. But in honoring the one, it seemed that the second was precluded. 
The Hedgbeths learned that due to various legal concerns, no ashes of organ donors who donate their bodies to science are returned to the respective families of these donors. This situation presented an insurmountable obstacle for the Hedgbeth family who were informed by a regretful staff at Arlington National Cemetery, that current regulations prohibit memorializing veterans in the Columbarium unless their remains were actually inurned there. 
While I can appreciate that limited space at Arlington has necessitated adherence to strict guidelines for burial and memorialization, I cannot see the virtue in denying appropriate recognition for an entitled veteran simply because he has donated his remains to science. In fact, I would like to encourage more veterans to do just that. 
All of us recognize the great need for viable remains for both transplantation and for medical study. Mr. Roger Hedgbeth and other veterans who make this courageous commitment should be suitably recognized and their loved ones should know that a grateful nation has made a place for them at one of our country's most sacred memorials. 
With that said, I submit this bill which seeks to modify current regulations to allow otherwise qualified veterans, who have donated their remains to science, to be memorialized at the Columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery, not withstanding the absence of their cremated remains.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have heard many of the statements made here today and yesterday regarding the defense authorization conference report and, indeed, I had hoped to come to the floor earlier, but I was involved in a meeting in my office with the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Yugoslavia in a very serious and protracted discussion about the possible military options that Mr. Milosevic's Government and our Government were considering with respect to the situation in Kosovo, and the readiness of the military forces as well as the ability of those forces to respond to various contingencies was a significant part of our discussion. 
Many of our colleagues have expressed their concern over the degraded state of readiness of our armed services. Mr. President, I share those concerns, especially as they relate to our fundamental ability to fight and win two major wars as is called for by our national military strategy. 
Admittedly, the need to fight two such wars has been challenged by many, but until the tense situations in the Middle East and the Korean peninsula are behind us, we do not have the luxury of cutting force structure anymore. Indeed, in the words of the well-known Broadway musical, `we've gone about as `fer' as we can go.' 
Yesterday, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four service chiefs confirmed that the risk we now associate with fighting in a second theater is high. By `high risk,' we mean that the level of troop losses in such a conflict could be unacceptably high. This, Mr. President, is a serious development and one which merits our immediate attention. Many of our colleagues have also expressed frustration that we were made aware of this and other readiness problems only recently. 
While I share some of these frustrations, I also appreciate the complexity of predicting problems even a few months out. Pilot retention, for example, can be a function of the strength of the economy. Moreover, I appreciate the comments by our service chiefs in a hearing yesterday that reinforced the immense complexity of managing our readiness, especially like a major downsizing unlike anything we have been through since the end of World War II. 
This having been said, we have a serious readiness problem that threatens to nosedive very quickly. We are already eating our seed corn, and the threat of a hollow force, according to our witnesses yesterday, looms only 5 or perhaps a few more years out. 
Some fixes can be made in short order; others, such as fielding new equipment that won't consume so much of our resources to maintain, may take years. 
The obvious solution and one quoted by many of those participating in the hearing and certainly by our service chiefs is more money. 
While I will support supplemental funding for the Department of Defense, I do so with considerable frustration over this Congress' inability to have the courage to cut wasteful defense spending. While we rail on and on about the administration for underfunded readiness, we refuse to cut bases. One more base closure round should realize around $3 billion a year in steady-state savings, enough to pay for a host of readiness problems. 
While some attack our service leaders for not being forthcoming, we add hundreds of millions of dollars in military construction projects that, although requested by the military for future years, we rush to build today so we can score points back in our States and districts just before an election. While some claim we have had no indications of a looming readiness problem, the fact is that we have. But despite this, we added over $2 billion in this bill for procurement and research and development projects that were simply not requested by the military. I am not suggesting they are not necessary in the long term, but they were not requested by the military in this bill. 
Mr. President, I support this conference report. I will support the supplemental funding package. But I hope each and every Member will find the will next year to support substantial infrastructure reductions and stop pushing so many Member interests onto the defense authorization bill so that we can put those limited tax dollars that we do have available for our Nation's defense to work directly and exclusively for the soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines who are willing to risk their lives for this Nation. 
With that, Mr. President, there will be more to say tomorrow when the defense authorization report is formally considered by the Chamber. 
I ask unanimous consent that the previous unanimous consent order be modified to accommodate the distinguished Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I understand that a number of Senators could conceivably benefit from the additional flights at National. Current language in the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to award new flights for service outside the perimeter if those flights will provide `network benefits beyond the perimeter' and `increase competition in multiple markets.' 
I believe this proposed test tilts the Secretary's decision in favor of consumers flying beyond the perimeter and away from considering the benefits to all consumers using this region's airports. For that reason, I am proposing an amendment to provide a more balanced approach. Consumers using the airports are not just worried about the availability of long-haul service, they are also worried about timely service and the availability of service to smaller airports. 
The amendment I am offering would simply require the Secretary to consider those factors in awarding any new slots at National. Senators Gregg, Smith of New Hampshire, Graham of Florida, Snowe, and Collins have agreed to cosponsor this amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith of New Hampshire and Senator Graham of Florida be added as cosponsors to the amendment.

Mr. President, while we are waiting for what I hope will be a final resolution of one remaining matter on this bill, I would like to speak to the bill itself, with the understanding of my friend and colleague from Arizona, who knows that I am going to be critical of a portion of the bill. I would like to also thank my colleagues from the capital area, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, as well as Senators from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes and Senator Mikulski, for their efforts to make some improvements in an area of this bill that concerns all of us, and many others. 
Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my strong opposition to interference in our region's airports that is included in the FAA reauthorization bill. I certainly understand that this overall legislation is important for the Nation as a whole, and I fully support most of the bill. We must clearly prepare for the future by investing in aviation infrastructure, safety, and security. This bill provides for those critical investments and, for that, I thank Senators McCain and Ford. 
This bill also reauthorizes the Airport Improvement Program, which funds the capital needs of our Nation's airports, including millions of dollars for Virginia facilities. Moreover, as the bill's name implies, it reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA monitors aircraft inspections, manages air traffic control, and develops new ways to detect and prevent security threats. Without these efforts, few people would want to travel by air. 
But beyond all of the good and necessary things this bill does, Mr. President, it also reneges on two important Federal commitments to the citizens of Virginia and this area--the existing flight limits and the existing perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. These two Federal commitments are extremely important to the future strength and stability of both National and Dulles Airports, Mr. President. They are also extremely important to the communities that surround the airports and have relied on the existing rules. 
Mr. President, as my friend and the author of this legislation is quoted as saying just yesterday--but admittedly in a different context--`a deal is a deal.' And changing that deal to the clear detriment of the communities and businesses that relied on it--is fundamentally unfair. 
This Congress should not involve itself in matters that are essentially local and regional, that serve both the airports and their communities well, and that have provided and continue to provide a road map to future economic strength for the people of northern Virginia as well as those throughout the metropolitan Washington area. 
Mr. President, these changes are bad public policy because they benefit, in some cases, Members of Congress, and certainly a small group of consumers, while harming a far larger group. They wreak serious damage on the interdependence of National Airport and Dulles National Airport. They erode the quality of life for communities surrounding the airports. And they fly in the face of an agreement this Congress made in 1986 to turn those airports over to a regional authority and essentially leave them alone. 
First, Mr. President, proponents argue that this bill would marginally assist air travelers by increasing the number of daily flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. But when we increase the number of flights to benefit a few people, we increase the congestion for everyone, and we add to the overall delays of all who fly in and out of National Airport. 
In weakening the perimeter rule, we allow a few select people to take long-haul flights out of National. But what about consumers who may lose their short-haul flights to make room for flights to California, Nevada, and Arizona? I am concerned that once we breach the perimeter rule we will eventually lose small-haul flights to smaller communities altogether. This would be brought about in a bill intended to assist travelers to underserved communities. 
Second, adjusting the perimeter rule at National will fundamentally shatter the carefully crafted interdependence between National and Dulles airports that has proven so effective in fostering growth at both airports. 
Today Dulles flourishes as an international gateway for our region. National thrives, providing convenient regional service. The history of both airports shows us that this constructive, vibrant interdependence is not by accident. 
National first opened in 1941, before the advent of large commercial jets such as the DC-8. And Dulles was built in 1962 because larger jets could not land on National's short runways. Medium-sized jets arrived on the scene in 1966, and National soon became overcrowded. Jets were forced to circle, and delays were considerable. 
In 1966, the airlines agreed to limit the number of flights at National. They also agreed to a perimeter rule to further reduce overcrowding. 
But these were voluntary limits and did not provide the security or the stability needed to maximize the potential of either airport. So during the 1970's and early 1980's, improvements were negligible or nonexistent at both National and Dulles, for two reasons. 
One, National drained flights from Dulles. And so improvements at Dulles were put on hold. Two, improvements were also on hold at National. Extensive litigation and public protest over increasing noise lead to this freeze. And there was even some discussion of shutting down National completely. 
Congressional legislation in 1986 solved these problems by codifying the perimeter and slot rules that the airlines themselves had agreed upon, and by creating an independent authority to manage the airports. This statutorily limited the number of flights at National, along with the accompanying delays and noise, and increased the business at Dulles providing what we thought was long-term stability to both airports. 
Mr. President, there is no way around the fact that weakening the perimeter rule will bring long-haul flights to National at the expense of Dulles. 
This marriage between National and Dulles--along with the stability that accompanies most strong unions--has been extremely lucrative for both airports. 
Billions of dollars have been invested by businesses in the area near Dulles Airport based on the assumption that Dulles would remain the region's major international gateway. And the public represented by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has made significant investments in Dulles, including more than $1.6 billion in bonds. 
Investments in Reagan National Airport have also grown under the stability provided by local management and the slot and perimeter rules. Since the airport was transferred to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, more than $940 million has been invested in the airport. The new terminal is well designed, and represents our Nation's capital well. But the new terminal at National and the substantial investments at Dulles would not have occurred, Mr. President, without the perimeter and slot rules. 
In 1986, Congress was sensitive to community outrage as well as the need to improve service. In hearings on the legislation, Congressman Hammerschmidt asked how the Congress could be sure residents would support improvements at National. Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole stated:  
With a statutory bar, to more flights, noise levels, will continue to decline, as quieter aircraft, are introduced. 
Thus all the planned projects at National, would simply improve the facility, not increase, its capacity, for air traffic. 
Under these conditions, I believe that National's neighbors, will no longer object, to the improvements. 
Mr. President, as a result of this understanding between the local community and the Congress, we have had enormous benefits to air service in this region--benefits that we shouldn't imperil by changing rules that have worked so well. 
Third, Mr. President this exchange between Secretary Dole and Congressman Hammerschmidt illustrates that there was some concern about the effect of the transfer legislation on the people who live in the communities around National Airport. We need to be sensitive and respectful of their concerns and wishes today. 
Increasing the number of flights at National Airport will increase the noise level for local citizens, will exacerbate the congestion for residents, will increase delays for those who fly in and out of National, and could also pose safety risks for surrounding communities. 
Weakening the perimeter rule could wreak economic hardship on Dulles, which would threaten the countless businesses and families who settled around the airport expecting it to remain our Nations regional international gateway. 
By focusing on the few travelers who may benefit from increasing the flight limits at National, this bill ignores the harm it will cause to the many northern Virginia families who are neighbors to National Airport. Local communities and local businesses surrounding both airports are in opposition to changes in the flight limits and the perimeter rules. It is their quality of life, their economic strength, their ability to plan for a secure future, that is at risk with this portion of the legislation. We have a system in place that works for this region. We have a careful balance between two airports that needs to be preserved. 
Finally, Mr. President, with this bill we are again meddling in the affairs of two airports that Congress transferred to a regional authority which we created because we thought airports could be managed better by the authority than by Members of Congress. 
The 1986 transfer legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan embodied two important concepts that are demolished by the bill we are considering today: That local authorities--not the Federal Government--should decide local issues; and, that the two airports work together in tandem, and with BWI, to serve the national capital region. 
As I mentioned earlier, the operation of one airport cannot be changed without affecting the operation of the other. 
As the Senate Commerce Committee report noted at the time:  
[I]t is the legislation's purpose, to authorize the transfer under long-term lease of the two airports `as a unit, to a properly constituted independent airport authority, to be created by Virginia and the District of Columbia, in order to improve the management, operation, and development of these important transportation assets.' 
Let me quote from Congressman Dick Armey, who has the following to say about transferring the airports from Federal to local control: 
The simple fact is that our Federal Government was not designed, nor is it suited, to the task of running the day-to-day operations of civilian airports. 
Transferring control of the airports to an `independent authority' will put these airports on the same footing as all others in the country. 
It gets the Federal Government out of the day-to-day operation and management of civilian airports, and puts this control into the hands of those who are more interested in seeing these airports run in the safest and most efficient manner possible . . . Rather than throw limited federal funds at the airports and tell them to do what they can, this legislation will allow the type of coordinated long-range planning necessary to keep the airports safe and efficient into the future. 
The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has engaged in the type of long-range coordinated planning that Mr. Armey encouraged. Essential to that long-range plan is to balance the operations of the two interdependent airports. National is designed to handle short-haul flights inside the perimeter, and Dulles is designed to handle long-haul flights which are essential to maintaining Dulles as an international gateway. 
Yesterday, I heard one of my colleagues comment on the bustling activities surrounding Dulles. The current robust growth at Dulles results directly from the balance between the two airports. The legislation we are considering today begins to tip that balance in a way that will harm both of the airports as well as the communities that surround them. 
As Senator Dole said during debate on the 1986 legislation: 
Mr. President, I would like to take just one moment to reaffirm my support for passage of the regional airport bill. 
Continuing to quote Senator Dole. `There are a few things the Federal Government--and only the Federal Government--can do well. Running local airports is not one of them.' 
Finally, Mr. President, in making these changes to the flight limits and the perimeter rule, proponents argue that we are just following the wisdom of the free market. I am aware that the slot and perimeter rules are limits on the market, and I am also aware that GAO studies have criticized the rules as anticompetitive. Moreover, I believe in the free market. 
But Government has a role in checking the excesses that can flow from an unfettered free market. The market won't educate children, the market won't protect workers, the market won't check monopolies, and the market won't safeguard our natural resources. 
So our charge as policymakers in a capitalist economy is to allow individuals and entrepreneurs and businesses the freest rein possible while safeguarding society's other concerns. Defining those concerns and implementing those safeguards without destroying the benefits we achieve from the free market is one of the most difficult tasks we face. 
Mr. President, the free market doesn't care if Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is unnecessarily congested, but we do. The free market doesn't care if there are flight delays, but we do. The free market doesn't care if there is excessive noise in Alexandria or Arlington, but we do. The free market doesn't care if Dulles Airport is harmed, but we do. 
We seek a balance here between the free market and the strength of our airports and the quality of life of our people. That balance is embodied in the flight limits and perimeter rule. They should not be sacrificed to the free market in this debate. 
And perhaps more egregiously, Mr. President, this legislation applies an adherence to free market principles on an inconsistent and selective basis. This bill, for example, contemplates restricting air flights over both small and large parks. The report on the bill states that the Commerce Committee `intends that the [Federal agencies] work together to preserve quiet in the national parks.' The report goes on to say that while `natural quiet is not an important attribute for all national parks, such as historic sites in urban settings,' preserving quiet in some parks `may require banning commercial air tour operations over the park altogether.' 
I agree with the committee, Mr. President. We should work to preserve the pristine nature of our national parks for the public to enjoy. 
But how can we abandon free market principles to preserve the sanctity of our parks and use free market principles to damage the sanctity of life here in our Nation's Capital? It would be wrong, Mr. President, to force Virginians and those who live in this area to endure more noise from National Airport. 
There is a second significant inconsistency in this bill, and that involves service assistance for small communities. 
On the one hand, the bill attempts to expand service to underserved communities. It creates the Community-Carrier Air Service Program which seeks to develop public/private partnerships with commercial airlines and the local State and Federal governments. These partnerships will offer service previously unavailable. In addition, the bill maintains the Essential Air Service Program which now subsidizes air service in communities such as Kingman, AZ; Rockland, ME; and Seward, AL. 
On the other hand, we jeopardize short-haul service from National. This legislation weakens the perimeter rule which was created to both improve service to underserved airports and to expand service at Dulles Airport. Again, if we weaken the perimeter rule, we weaken more than Dulles Airport. We begin a dangerous journey that could jeopardize consumer access to smaller airports across the Nation that currently benefit from the perimeter rule. 
Fortunately, Mr. President, the bill before us does not erase the perimeter rule altogether. Unfortunately, it does damage to the rule, and I believe it contemplates doing away with the rule completely, which embodies its own threat to the economic performance of our region. 
Before I conclude, I want to ask that Members of this body step back for just a moment and recommit ourselves to honoring the commitment that we made to our regional airports in 1986. Those of us who represent this region have spent enormous time and energy over the last decade trying to keep the Congress from breaking its commitment to communities that we serve. We need to stop wasting valuable time micromanaging these airports. Let's put out a moratorium, if you will, on legislating changes that are in the purview of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. Let's give the Authority, say, 5 years to continue to develop a strong, vibrant air transportation system we want and need for this area at the dawn of a new millennium. 
I understand that Senators McCain and Lott will express their commitment not to interfere further in the slot and perimeter rule should this bill pass. I welcome that commitment. But let's acknowledge that the existing rules we change with this bill were carefully crafted, are based on sound public policy, and should not be altered. And let's oppose this Federal intervention in the operation of two airports that are doing just fine without us. 
Mr. President, I know this bill will pass, and it should for the reasons I stated at the outset. But in opposition to yet another broken promise by this Congress to the citizens of Virginia and this region, I will vote no on final passage and hope that my concerns, shared by so many of our colleagues, will be addressed in conference. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, may I thank our friend and colleague from Arizona, who has worked for many, many years. He does reflect an ongoing dialog that my distinguished senior Senator and I, and the two distinguished Senators from Maryland, have had with him as well as Senators representing a couple of the other airports that were affected by both flight and perimeter rules. 
I appreciate very much and take sincerely his offer to revisit the question on noise. I hope he will also include, at least in the spirit of the commitment that he makes, both congestion and diminution in the vitality of Dulles, which is really the other major issue that we are talking about. All of these are in play. 
But I understand and appreciate very much, as does my senior colleague, both the commitment the Senator from Arizona has made as well as the spirit of that commitment and the spirit with which he has worked with us over a very long period of time, many years, to get to this particular point. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to urge colleagues who had the courage to oppose this legislation when it was considered by the Senate last year to demonstrate again that same courage by voting to sustain the President's veto of the so-called partial-birth abortion bill. 
There is no question that this is a gut-wrenching issue. I know how passionately most of those feel who gather at the Capitol today and tomorrow to support a ban on this medical procedure and want us to override the President's veto. Those who have been telephoning, writing, and e-mailing us in such overwhelming numbers are equally emotional in expressing the depth of their feeling in opposition to abortion generally and to this procedure in particular. 
This will be a very tough vote. But, as a matter of sound public policy, it is the right vote, and it is consistent with our Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court. If this legislation were to become law, the Congress would be telling physicians how to practice medicine, and Senators, with one exception, are not trained or certified to do that. In fact, the only Member of this body who is a physician made a comment during an interview on HMO reform recently about who should, and, more important, who should not be practicing medicine. He said that `[Congress] should not be practicing medicine. . . . Doctors should be practicing medicine. That's very clear.' 
Mr. President, it is important that everyone understand what is really at issue here. This debate is not about whether or when to terminate a pregnancy, because this bill will prevent not a single abortion; it is only about how to terminate a pregnancy. If it is otherwise lawful for a woman to terminate a pregnancy, this bill will only require that she and her doctor choose another medical procedure, even though her doctor may believe that procedure is less protective of her health. 
In some States, it is legal for a woman to terminate a pregnancy in the third trimester, even when the life or health of the mother are not at issue. This bill does not address that situation at all. 
It is appropriate to note, however, that some of us supported a tough ban on third-trimester abortions when this bill was considered last year, but our efforts were defeated by proponents of this bill in an effort to keep a very politically potent issue alive. But I ask those who want to keep abortions safe, legal, and rare, as I do, and who are disturbed by this procedure, as I am, to stop for a moment and think: What specific abortion procedure would you prefer? Because this legislation will necessarily encourage the use of some other procedure that I believe, if we focus on the specific details of the alternative procedure, we would find equally disturbing. 
In truth, this debate is really about how an abortion is performed and, more essentially, about who chooses. It is about whether Congress chooses or whether American women and their doctors choose. I believe American women and their doctors should choose. I am troubled that at the heart of this legislation is an incredible presumption, the presumption that this Congress is more concerned or better qualified to judge than expectant parents about what is best for their families. 
In matters this personal, what is best for American families should be decided by American families based on their individual beliefs and faith. Most opponents of this ban have very strong convictions about when life begins. But ultimately, Mr. President, the very question of when life begins is also a matter of belief, a matter of faith, a matter between individuals and their God. Some denominations believe life begins at conception. Others believe life begins at birth. Still another believes life begins 120 days after conception, at the time the soul enters the fetus. 
My point here is that we must be very careful when legislating matters of faith, ours or someone else's. And in the absence of knowing, rather than believing, when life begins, we are forced to draw some very difficult lines. That is what the Supreme Court did in Roe v. Wade. The Court said that in the first trimester, the decision to continue a pregnancy is solely within the discretion of the mother; in the second trimester, the Government may impose reasonable regulations designed to protect the health of the mother; and in the third trimester, the rights of the unborn child are recognized, with the rights of the child weighed against the rights of the mother to escape harm or death. 
The Court has been clear in protecting a woman's life and health, both before and after viability, even striking down a method-of-choice case because it failed to require that maternal health be the physician's paramount consideration. 
Proponents of this bill frequently cite the American Medical Association's support for this legislation, but not the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' opposition to it. In fact, the ACOG has told us `the intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised and dangerous.' 
Again, Mr. President, we are a Congress of legislators, not a Congress of physicians. There are places we should not go and decisions we should not make. A respect for the judgment of physicians, a respect for the rights and needs of families in often excruciatingly difficult circumstances, and a respect for our Constitution ought to lead us to conclude that this bill should not pass. 
Let me conclude by saying that I am pro-choice, I am not pro-abortion. I respect those who believe that abortions should never be performed, for religious or moral or personal reasons, and I believe that those individuals should follow their faith and choose not to have one. I particularly admire the convictions of those who choose life, even in the most difficult circumstances. But in choosing life, they choose. They choose life, just as families that make different and sometimes agonizing choices should also be allowed to choose. 
I believe that, as legislators, we have an obligation to protect the rights of all those who live in our States. We all believe in freedom. We all understand that with freedom comes responsibility. Yet, at its heart, this legislation says to the women of America: We don't trust you with the freedom to choose; we don't trust you to do what we think is right; so we will take away your freedom to search your hearts, to follow your conscience, to rely on your faith and the judgment of your physicians and to make a very personal decision that affects your lives and your families. 
That is why I will vote to sustain the President's veto, and I hope at least those who opposed the bill last year will do so again. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act. I do so because I believe that the legislation is necessary to preserve membership opportunities in these financial cooperatives. Given the Supreme Court ruling limiting membership, it is both appropriate and necessary for Congress to pass this legislation to ensure that the requirements for membership in a specific credit union reflect current practices. 
As my colleagues know, since 1982, credit unions have been able to take in new groups of members outside their original common bond provided that the additional groups brought in shared a common bond. Not only was this done for safety and soundness concerns, but it also has helped individuals maintain their credit union ties through base closings and other employment changes. 
The bill before us today guarantees that no existing member will be forced to give up his or her ties to their current credit union as a result of the Supreme Court decision. It also allows credit unions to continue to attract new members who are part of an existing membership group as well as new groups provided that the new group has a common bond of occupation or association and has less than 3,000 members at the time they join the credit union. This effectively covers 98% of all businesses in America. 
I for one have never quarreled with the need for credit unions to continue to attract new members. But with new opportunities come new responsibilities. If credit unions are to have all the rights of a for-profit financial institution, equity requires that they share in their responsibilities. For this reason, I voted to keep the community reinvestment responsibilities in the bill and I also voted to further limit commercial lending activities of credit unions, hoping thereby to keep them to their original focus of consumer lending. In my view, the continuation of their tax-exempt status is threatened by efforts to have credit unions undertake all the rights of a for-profit financial institution. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I want credit union members in the Commonwealth of Virginia to know that I am a strong supporter of their institutions and their rights of membership. As a credit union member myself, I will continue to preserve membership opportunities in these important institutions.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I just want to add my voice to those who have already spoken and those who will. 
Friday was a difficult day for all of us here as part of the family. That has been more eloquently described than I can describe it both today and elsewhere. Like many of the Members, I happened to be in my office less than 100 yards away from where the shooting took place. I was unaware of the shooting. I heard the sirens and I heard the helicopter when it approached to take the victims to the trauma center. At that point, I tuned in and observed what was happening. 
There was a sense on the part of all of us that something very tragic had occurred to members of the family. It wasn't until the names were released that we knew which members of the family had been affected. I realized when the names were ultimately released and saw the pictures that Officer J.J. Chestnut was the person who had been on that post any number of times. Many of us who come and go from the Nation's Capitol late in the evening find that is one of the few doors that is open. So we get to know the people who are there, and they are always greeting us with a smile. 
In truth, I didn't know that I knew or had a relationship with Special Agent Gibson until I found out from my wife and mother-in-law that during a recent visit he had accompanied them throughout a tour of the Capitol, and they had been very grateful for the professional courtesies and kindness that he had extended to them. I found out that he was a resident of Lake Ridge, VA. It just so happens that the other person who was wounded, Angela Dickerson, was a tourist and taking a family on a tour, also happens to be from Chantilly, VA. I noted that J.J. Chestnut was a Vietnam veteran and is going to be accorded full military honors when he is buried Friday in Arlington. 
These were very, very special people. The initial feeling among many when we heard that there had been gunfire inside the Capitol was that somehow the security system had broken down. I was relieved and pleased, as I think all of our Members were, to know that in this case the system had actually worked, and it had worked superbly. The men who ultimately gave their lives had done so in precisely the way they were trained to protect the Capitol and all who serve in it. I think that is a testament to the professionalism of the Capitol Police and to all of the members of this extended family. 
I didn't go out and talk to the media on Friday, but two down-State reporters came to my office, unsolicited, and I talked to them for a couple of minutes. One asked me, `What should we do?' I said, `I hope we don't do much of anything. We will take a look at the procedures, but we want to keep the people's house as open as we possibly can.' I think this is a symbol of democracy, and these two men died in defending that symbol. But we want to be careful not to take the wrong actions. 
What we can do, and what we ought to do, is remember to thank those who serve us--whose service we sometimes take for granted. On the way out of the Capitol later that evening, I stopped and thanked the Capitol Police officers who were still on duty. They were still doing their duties professionally, although they were grieving. I happened to go to an engagement that I had that evening and I was late coming back. It didn't conclude until almost midnight. I said, `I want to go back to the Capitol. The midnight shift will have come on now and they are going to take it pretty hard as well.' I had a chance to quietly visit with some of the other members of the Capitol Police. 
Many of us are trying to find a way to say to those men and women who serve so ably, and sometimes without the recognition that they deserve, that we are grieving with them, that we appreciate what they did, what they continue to do. I suggest to people who might not be a part of the extended family here in the Capitol that all of us feel that if you want to find a way to express your appreciation, stop your local policeman on the street and say `thank you' because they, too, are providing a kind of service that, in many cases, we end up taking for granted; yet, it is critically important. When the chips are down, these folks respond. And as my distinguished colleague from Connecticut noted a minute ago, when many seek cover, that is the time they put themselves directly in harm's way to ensure that access to our Nation's Capitol and the freedom to move about for all of us who benefit from their services goes uninterrupted. 
With that, I will close. I just wanted to say to all of those who continue to serve: Thank you. We don't always remember to say that. To the families of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson, in particular, we share your loss. You are in our thoughts and prayers, and to all who serve us in ways too numerous to count, we do appreciate what you have done for us and what you continue to do for us. We will continue to remember the extraordinary service and the ultimate sacrifice that was made by these two fine officers in defense of our Nation's Capitol. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I will be very brief. I concur with the assessment just rendered by the distinguished Senator from Utah. My distinguished senior Senator, Senator Warner, and I are both very much opposed to this amendment. It is a delaying tactic that simply benefits the status quo and costs money. 
For the benefit of Senators, I will quote from a couple of the reports that were referenced indirectly by the Senator from Utah, if I may. The Appropriations Committee, July 2, committee report: 
The committee has reviewed the reports submitted by the Secretary, and does not object to the Secretary's direction that the competitive procurement process should continue. 
An independent report dated May 15, 1998, by Jefferson Solutions, Inc., BTG, Inc., Economics Research Associates: 
The PTO has used a sound methodology and valid reasoning in defining its need for new space, in researching its current and future functional needs, and in managing its consolidation and space acquisition process. 
With respect to this, the Department of Commerce inspector general report in March 1998 in terms of its fiscal prudence: 
Long-term cost savings should be realized because the current leased PTO space is more expensive than the $24 per square foot authorized by the Congress. 
An independent report, May, 22, 1998, by Deva & Associates: 
The conclusion of this business case analysis . . . is that the PTO should proceed . . . because the agency will incur, over the 20-year lease period, $72,395,278 less in costs.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, support for education has been at the top of my priorities since I began my career as a public servant. 
I've worked for many years, and on several fronts, to strengthen our public schools and universities, and I've focused as well on an essential prerequisite for improving educational opportunities--a safe learning environment. Unfortunately, not all students share the privilege of attending a safe school. 
Over the past year, tragic murders at schools across the Nation have chilled parents' hearts. Perhaps even more chilling are figures from a spring 1998 Department of Justice study, which indicates just how many schools, and schoolchildren, are at risk. In the past year, nearly 60 percent of all elementary and secondary schools reported at least one incident of criminal activity to the police. Roughly 20 percent of schools reported six crimes or more. One out of every ten schools reported a serious violent crime during the past year. 
Mr. President, crime in school is a double threat--a threat not just to safety and property, but to our entire educational system. Parents should worry about their children dodging homework, not dodging bullets. Teachers should be able to devote their energy to promoting academic achievement, not counseling victims. And students should be focused on their next exam, not on making it safely to the next class. 
While the States have the primary responsibility for both education and criminal justice, and the Federal Government cannot give every neighborhood crime-free schools, I believe the Congress should do more. The Federal Government can help by supporting innovative efforts by local communities and law enforcement to improve safety, by sharing insights gained from these efforts with communities across the Nation, and simply by focusing attention on this problem. 
During past Congresses, I supported prevention programs to assist local communities, including drug resistance education, school security grants, and the Gun Free School Zones Act. In 1993, I worked to create a Commission on Violence in Schools to study school safety. I've also voted for additional deterrence measures, including adult prosecution of armed juveniles who commit violent crimes, and increased funding for juvenile prisons. 
Last fall, I proposed an amendment to permit funds available under the Community Oriented Policing Services Program (COPS) to go to school safety initiatives. COPS funding 
has been restricted in the past to hiring new police officers. The amendment I proposed, and the Senate adopted, expanded the use of COPS funding to reward innovative crime-reduction efforts by communities and law enforcement, to share knowledge about successful school-safety programs, and to raise public awareness about school crime. Thanks to the support of Senators Gregg and Hollings, $17.5 million in grants were made available in fiscal year 1998. The grants will be awarded later this fall to communities across the Nation. 
This spring, I spoke with Senators Hollings and Gregg and urged them to continue and expand this program in fiscal year 1999, and I am grateful for their generosity and their commitment to the cause. The chair and ranking member provided more than $210 million for a Schools Safety Initiative. Under this initiative, $10 million will support research in technology to improve school safety, such as weapons detection equipment. Another $25 million will fund community efforts to promote nonviolent dispute resolution, to train teachers and parents to recognize troubled children, and to strengthen families. 
The bulk of the School Safety Initiative, $175 million, will be administered under the COPS school safety program that I initiated last fall. I believe this funding level is a strong statement to students, parents, teachers, and law enforcement. This program indicates that school safety is a national priority, and I hope schools and communities across the Nation will respond. 
A number of schools in Virginia have already taken action. Some have set up anonymous crime tip lines for their students. Police in Richmond work with students to promote peaceful conflict resolution and drug resistance education. Other communities, such as Pulaski County, have actually placed police officers in schools. 
One remaining concern I have is the attention to this issue will receive from future Congresses. In my view, the matter of school safety deserves sustained attention, and continuing support from the this body. There are several juvenile justice reform bills pending before the Senate, and I'd like to move forward on legislation in this area this year. Unfortunately, that appears unlikely. 
Therefore, I look forward to working with my colleagues next year to schedule a full debate on juvenile justice issues, as a well as to provide continued support for school safety through the appropriations process during conference with the House this year and next.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I would like to call my colleagues' attention to one of the international organizations being funded by the Commerce-State-Justice Appropriation bill, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
As many of my colleagues areaware, the OECD has its origins in the Marshall plan. While its original mandate was to help rebuild post-War Europe, over the years, the OECD has taught us that nations through economic cooperation can take charge of their own destinies. Article 1 of the OECD Convention clearly states its mission, which is to have its member nations achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment, to contribute to sound economic expansion in Member as well as non-member nations, and to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis. These goals are as relevant today as they were when the OECD was founded. 
The current work of the OECD spans the horizon. A few issues that are important to this Congress that the OECD is working on are the Asian economic crisis, the Anti-Bribery Convention and crytography policy. OECD economic surveys, its twice-yearly Economic Outlook and its countless statistics on a wide range of economic activities are important sources of information for us as we meet the challenges of the global economy. 
But the OECD has also understood that in today's tough budgetary environment, there is a real need to make cuts. And organization officials have taken these necessary steps. The OECD is decreasing its budget which to date includes a reduction of 180 staff, more than 10% of its total. Clearly, the OECD gets the message and deserves credit for its efforts. 
I urge the committee and the administration to fully fund the OECD. It continues to make a valuable contribution, and is willing to implement the kinds of reforms that should only increase its efficiency and productivity.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, for over a year now I have been working with many minority farmers to address the problem of discrimination at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I am pleased that we have finally found a way to provide relief to these farmers. I thank, in particular, the Senator from Mississippi for his efforts and commitment to work out the details of this important amendment. 
This amendment will provide long overdue relief for many minority farmers who were the victims of systematic and egregious discrimination by USDA officials--discrimination which has been acknowledged by Secretary Glickman and the USDA. 
This amendment, which is very similar to language which has already passed in the House, seeks to remedy this problem by imposing a new statute of limitations for farmers who experienced discrimination between 1981 and 1996 and who filed complaints to seek redress. 
As I discovered about a year or so ago, many farmers were denied credit opportunities and were discriminated against when seeking housing loans, and obtained no relief from USDA when they complained of such discrimination. 
These farmers filed discrimination complaints with the USDA's Office of Civil Rights in the early 1980's. However, they were never told that, in 1983, the Office of Civil Rights at USDA was abolished. Furthermore, they had no notice that their claims were not even being investigated despite being led to believe otherwise. 
These farmers are barred, only by the statute of limitations, from obtaining relief from this mistreatment. Whether it is a racial slur or a denial of credit opportunities, discrimination is unconscionable and it is intolerable, and it is particularly appalling when such discrimination is exhibited by Government officials--officials employed by our Government to serve all Americans, as was the case with the USDA. 
Studies, reports, and task forces in 1965, 1970, 1982 and 1990, have all documented the same inherent problems at USDA--continued discrimination and mistreatment of minority and socially disadvantaged customers. 
It is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office that the relief for these farmers' claims is approximately $15 million in fiscal year 1999 and $42 million over the next 3 years. That means that the Congressional Budget Office believes that the Government legitimately owes $15 million in order to provide relief to farmers who were discriminated against by our Government officials. 
The statute of limitations is now the only obstacle standing in the way of these farmers getting the relief they deserve. And this amendment simply removes that obstacle. 
Inexplicably, the discrimination that many minority farmers suffered at the hands of USDA officials still has not been punished or mitigated. This amendment will mitigate for the farmers who were discriminated against. 
Too many farmers and communities have been affected by this travesty, Mr. President. I am pleased that the U.S. Senate has chosen not to remain silent. 
In reaching a resolution, I particularly thank Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, Senator Grassley, Senator Lugar, and their staffs, and my staff for their hard work. I also thank Secretary Glickman and his staff at USDA and the staff at the Department of Justice for their commitment and hard work on this amendment. 
Finally, I especially acknowledge and thank the White House for its unwavering support of this amendment and of these farmers. While it has been a challenge to work on the spending issues, and reach agreement on the offsets, I believe the result was well worth the effort. What we have done today, Mr. President, is right, just, and long overdue. 
With that, I yield the floor and seek action on the amendment.  
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBB. I thank the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arkansas for their long-suffering understanding and help on this amendment. 
I add, lest anyone be concerned--or to add to the discussion which was right on the money--that any claims that exceed $75,000 will actually be reviewed by the Justice Department. So in addition to the claims being reviewed by the Department of Agriculture, the Justice Department would review a claim in excess of that particular amount. This gives an additional screen for claims that might be viewed as excessive in any way, shape or form. But the bottom line is, as both Senators have suggested, this removes an impediment that otherwise would bar a meritorious claim. And it does nothing more than that.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, let me say that I think the debate this afternoon has been instructive, particularly with respect to the impact of sanctions, because we are acknowledging, perhaps for the first time in a forum and debate like this, the fact that sanctions clearly have limitations and all too often the target of the sanctions ends up being less impacted by the sanctions that are actually put in place than the country that enacts those particular sanctions. 
Senator Brownback spoke a few moments ago of a trip that he and I took to the Asian subcontinent just over a week ago. We had very good meetings with Prime Minister Vajpai and his key officials within his Government, including Interior Minister Advani, Defense Minister Fernandez, and others. We spent another day in Pakistan with Prime Minister Sharif, Foreign Minister Khan, and a number of key officials. We went up to a line of control and not only observed the positions there but did observe the fact that the fighting in the Kashmir area continues to inflict far more casualties on civilians than it does on actual combatants. 
But for a very different reason than my good friend and colleague from Ohio, I am pleased that section 3 was removed because it was less than, I believe, we need to do in terms of taking congressional fingers off of the ability to waive sanctions that we currently employ. I believe it is important that we continue to focus on our oversight role and make the administration not only responsible for the conduct of foreign policy, but for defending foreign policy choices. But ultimately, if we prescribe sanctions and act, in effect, as 535 Secretaries of State in too many instances, we make it virtually impossible for the administration to carry out the functions of any administration--whether it be Democratic or Republican--to carry out the functions that we expect an administration to carry out on our behalf. So taking section 3 out of this particular legislation, which would have had a limited waiver authority, and working to provide the kind of complete waiver authority and comprehensive treatment that I believe this subject deserves, in my judgment, it is the right thing to do. Given the statement just made a few minutes ago by the distinguished Senator from Ohio, it may be that we will have extended debate on that particular topic. But it is important that we do so. 
In this particular instance, much like fast-track authority and others, the Congress of the United States can play a role, but frequently its most important role is as the `bad cop' to provide an opportunity for the administration to get concessions and to make progress in areas that, but for the possible effect of sanctions or other activities that the Congress might impose, the President working directly with the other country with singular decisionmaking authority can achieve results that we simply could not obtain if we were reliant solely upon the actions of the Congress of the United States. 
So I am pleased to be supportive of this legislation. I think that food is the right place to draw the line in the near term. I support the amendment that will be offered by my distinguished colleague from Virginia, and I believe the Senator from Connecticut, with respect to adding medicine to that list--I think that is an appropriate addition. 
Next week, we will begin to consider, in a more comprehensive fashion, the kinds of authority that we ought to provide to the Chief Executive of the United States, whatever party he or she might be in at any given time, the authority to negotiate directly with foreign governments and not have the prospect of having to then bring whatever negotiation that took place back to the Congress, where it might be amended or changed. 
With that, again, I salute those who were involved. I thank Senator Brownback for making a very exhaustive 96-hour trip to visit those two countries and to get directly engaged in some of the problems that confront us. I thank all of our colleagues for the effort they have put into trying to find an equitable solution to a very serious problem confronting not only the United States and the South Asian Continent, but the international community and sanctions that we might employ in the future have the kind of effects that we may not have intended them to take. 
With that, I yield back whatever time I may have and I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, very briefly, every single Member of this Chamber understands that eventually we will have to have the intestinal fortitude to reduce infrastructure if we are going to support force structure. This amendment moves us in precisely the opposite direction. If we don't have the fortitude to make those choices, let's at least let our commanders have the flexibility so they can make the choices for us in the interim. 
Mr. President, virtually every Member of this body knows that another one or two rounds of base closures will not only save money, but will save billions. But many in the Congress have concluded unequivocally that preserving jobs and infrastructure in their states and districts is more important than military readiness and modernization. Some are in fact determined to punish the Administration for its actions related to privatization-in-place at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. But who is being punished? We punish the nation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best use of the resources with which they entrust us. We punish today's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose readiness depends on adequate funding for equipment, training and operations. We punish tomorrow's force as we continue to mortgage research, development, and modernization of equipment necessary to keep America strong into the 21st century. 
The amendment before us takes our parochialism and so-called punishment of the Administration even further. The amendment seeks to make it even more difficult for DoD to shift personnel among bases, to allocate resources as efficiently as possible, to align our infrastructure in the best manner for supporting the warfighter. Rather, this amendment represents a flagrant attempt to frustrate the legitimate efforts of our service leaders to reduce and realign their personnel and facilities to meet changing security requirements and save money. 
The standards for allowable realignment and adjustment of people and facilities are already significantly limiting for the services. Greater limits on service authority to adjust its infrastructure, reassign individuals and units, move forces and capabilities to where they are needed when they are needed--does nothing but harm national security. I urge my colleagues to reverse this insidious trend of raw parochialism, of protecting jobs and land and buildings at the expense of our nation's security. 
With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you. 
I understand the concerns that have been expressed by our colleague from Indiana and that undoubtedly underlie the concerns expressed by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I, too, had occasion recently to visit the marines who were training in Parris Island. And I talked with the women marines who were completing their training, completing the crucible. 
I do not think there was a more inspiring experience that I have had in recent years than being with them at the first light in the morning as they marched out with their separate training under those circumstances. As a former marine, I could not have been prouder. And I do not want to see us do anything to attempt to change either the culture or the success of the training program that the Marines engage in. 
But I do not want to see us change the culture or the success of the Army program or the Navy program or the Air Force program at this point either. I also had occasion to visit Fort Jackson and talked to the young women and young men who were undergoing training at both Fort Jackson and at Parris Island. 
I talked to the drill sergeants and the drill instructors. And neither program is entirely without some challenges, and indeed there was a significant challenge at Fort Jackson with respect to separation. That has been addressed by the Secretary of Defense. And many of the recommendations that were made by the Kassebaum-Baker commission were good and have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. 
But the bottom line is, we established a commission, as mentioned by Senator Kempthorne, to review those recommendations. I personally believe at this point, although I was skeptical at the outset, that I would prefer to see us take a step back and let the services make these determinations. But at the very least, I do not want to see us prematurely require the services to make changes that the service chiefs, the senior enlisted members of those services do not believe are in their best interests. 
And the kind of training and esprit which was clearly evident at Parris Island, but also evident at Fort Jackson, and in talking to the young women in training, as well as the drill sergeants--they liked the kind of training that they were engaged in. They thought it was successful. 
I hope that this Senate will consider the amendment that we dealt with last night by Senator Snowe from Maine. I think we made the right decision on that occasion. I hope this evening it will be the pleasure of the Senate not to pass this particular amendment, and allow our commission to make their report. Then we can take the actions that are appropriate under the circumstances. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman and yield the floor.

I simply remind our fellow Senators that the force structure and end strength of our armed services have been cut 30 percent in recent years. Our overseas commitments have increased significantly. Our funding for procurement is down 70 percent. If we are going to support the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who protect this country, we need to make certain that we provide for the kinds of priorities that will support them. And I join my friend from Arizona in being a scold on this particular issue. I know it is popular, but we are not doing enough to provide the kind of support that we need for our services today. This is popular, but it is not the right kind of priority.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report, but let me say to the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others that I appreciate the bipartisan effort and spirit that has gone into it in an attempt to formulate a bill that could receive bipartisan support. Indeed, it is evident on the floor today that it has some bipartisan support and will pass by a significant margin. 
Let me say also, I agree with the concerns mentioned by the Senator from Florida with respect to some changes that took place in the conference. The Senator from Florida and I served as Governors of our respective States in the early eighties, along with the current President, the current Secretary of Education and others, and all of us had education as the very top priority in terms of things that we were doing. 
Let me say with respect to this bill, though, it is, again, about priorities. It is not that this bill does bad things. I continue to support many of the things, and certainly encouraging parents to save for education, but if you only have $1.6 billion to spend in terms of the Federal participation, it seems to me it makes more sense than to spend it on a tax cut that would be about $7 per family to those who are in the public schools and $37 a family in private schools, to spend it where it is most needed. 
If 90 percent of our public schools are either in need of repair or overcrowded, we ought to spend that money in terms of building or repairing schools. We ought to spend that money to hire more teachers, and if technology is as important in the world economy today as we know it to be--indeed, as we speak, the World Congress on Information Technology is concluding just across the river with nations throughout the world that are here to discuss information technology--we ought to be spending the money to try to assist schools in connecting to that information technology that is going to be so critical to their future. 
I believe if we want to continue to support public education, which I believe is our principal responsibility, then we ought to spend it on those most critical needs, notwithstanding the fact that this bill, as it currently exists, does some good things for education, but it doesn't do the kind of things that, if we only have $1.6 billion to spend, I believe we ought to do. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining to the distinguished Senator from California.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I was pleased to be able to yield to my distinguished senior colleague notwithstanding an earlier conversation that appeared to combine two very fine States in ways that might not work to the complete satisfaction of the two junior Senators from those States. 
Mr. President, the defense bill before us today is a solid package. It represents a bipartisan effort on the part of the committee and a delicate balance between funding our readiness today and preparing for the wars of tomorrow. 
We are hearing a familiar ring with regard to defense spending. Force structure and end strength have been slashed by over 30 percent. Overseas commitments have increased significantly and are pushing our troops to their limits. Procurement funding is down by over 70 percent. And our vehicles, ships, and aircraft inventories are too old and cannot be sustained at current production rates. 
On the other hand, we are now, in the context of imminent major military challenges, in a relatively benign period. The end of the cold war has allowed us to reduce force structure and end strength by roughly one-third and procurement by well over half. Despite this, we are still spending at 85 percent of the average cold war peacetime spending levels, and we will continue to do so at least through 2003--85 percent. 
We have gone from 18 to 10 Army divisions, 36 to 20 fighter wing equivalents, and 15 to 11 carriers. Yet we have only cut the budget top line by 15 percent. 
How do we explain this? In part, Mr. President, by increased overseas commitments. Yet even Bosnia involves only about a third of the division and is costing us less than 1 percent of the defense budget. In part, we are spending more for weapons. But weapons procurement is down by over 70 percent, and each new weapon is much more lethal than its predecessor, allowing us to buy fewer. 
In part, we are having to spend much more for maintenance per vehicle or ship or aircraft or weapon because many of these systems are so old. But new systems entering the inventory require far less maintenance, and much of the maintenance is now being done for less by the private sector. 
How then can we explain to the American taxpayer that we have cut forces by over a third but have only cut the budget by half? And that amounts to only about 15 percent. The obvious and unequivocal answer is infrastructure. Infrastructure means the facilities and other assets that support our troops on the front line. Above all, it means bases. 
Last month, we received a BRAC report required by last year's defense authorization bill. The report involved analysis of 259 bases that the military departments identified as major installations and concluded that DOD has about 23 percent excess capacity. 
The report went on to indicate that new base closure commissions in 2001 and 2005, if bold enough to close the bulk of the remaining excess, will add $21 billion in the years 2008 through 2015 and $3 billion every year thereafter. 
Needless to say, Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this Congress is unwilling to authorize another base realignment and closure commission at this time. 
If we don't have the courage to shut down these unneeded facilities to quit wasting so flagrantly the taxpayers' money, we will continue to stress our forces to their limits, to lose troops in droves that we've spent billions to recruit and train, and to fail to invest in the weapons, that will maintain our substantial military edge. 
I am especially troubled by those who will not support another BRAC then turn around and attack the Administration and the Congress for underfunding the military for deploying U.S. forces to contingencies overseas, or for procuring too few weapons. 
Mr. President, I understand, objections to BRAC, related to privatization-in-place of depot work in Texas and California even though this issue is mostly behind us, the atmosphere, remains unnecessarily charged. But the real issue here concerns who is being punished by Congressional indignation, with the BRAC process as a result of the recent depot controversy? 
In the end, we only punish those who most need the benefits of infrastructure savings. First, we punish the nation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best use of the resources with which they entrust us. Second, we punish today's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, whose readiness depends on sufficient reliable resources for equipment, training and operations through the year. Finally, we punish tomorrow's force, as we continue to mortgage, research, development, and modernization of equipment necessary to keep America strong into the 21st century. 
At its most basic level, getting rid of excess infrastructure, consistent with American public expectations, is just a good government. I reiterate may disappointment that we do not have the support needed to deal with this wasteful situation. 
Mr. President, I nonetheless support the bill in its current form. It includes many badly needed provisions, including a 3.1 percent pay raise for our troops, funding for Bosnia, and funding for numerous modern systems to replace those that are simply too old to effectively wage future battles and to be maintained at reasonable costs. I look forward to the continued deliberations on this important legislation, 
not only with my fellow members of the Senate Armed Services Committee but with the entire Senate on the important issues and challenges that face our Nation today. 
With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to object, but I just wanted my colleagues to be put on notice about my concerns with this bill. I appreciate the work of my two Senate colleagues who developed this bill, and my concerns about this bill actually fall with what is not included in the bill, rather than what is in the bill. 
Mr. President, we have a very serious problem at the USDA that no one seems to be very interested in solving. As some of you may know, there are a number of minority farmers who filed discrimination complaints with the USDA back in the 1980's and were told that the USDA was on the case. In fact, they weren't and didn't intend to be. After the statute of limitations passed for these farmers to file their discrimination complaints in a court of law, the USDA acknowledged that they never investigated or attempted to resolve these complaints. Since the statute of limitations has now passed for a number of these farmers, these farmers have been left with no remedy for the alleged acts of discrimination they suffered, all because of the inaction of the USDA. It seems to me we ought to address that matter at the earliest possible opportunity. 
Mr. President, many here may also be aware of several provisions which took effect with the enactment of the 1996 Farm bill which have resulted in the denial of credit to farmers, based on a write-down of a previous loan. This has a particularly disproportionate effect on minority farmers, even though in a number of cases it was the USDA that encouraged the individuals to take a write-down. This body added language to the Emergency Supplemental earlier this year which addressed this problem. However, that language was taken out in a conference with the House. It would seem to me that the least we could do here is to add that language to this bill. 
In sum, Mr. President, I do not object to proceeding with this bill, but I want to work with the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from Arkansas to see if we can address these issues in this bill.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, from the outset I had hoped to be able to vote for a bill that would effectively reduce underage smoking and I still hope to do so during this session of Congress. 
I continue to believe that a resolution of the issues surrounding tobacco are in the best interests of all interested parties--not just children, but also the public health community, plaintiffs, tobacco workers, tobacco companies, tobacco farmers and their communities. 
After nearly four weeks of Senate debate on this bill, however, the bill currently before us has lost its focus and falls well short of a reasonable resolution of the issues involved here. In fact, it actually undermines the original goals of the legislation. And with as little discernible benefit to the public health in the legislation as it currently stands, I cannot support a bill which unfairly places too heavy a burden on too many people I was sent here to represent. 
First, this legislation currently places no limits on the liability of tobacco companies. While I understand the desire of many of my colleagues to punish the companies for their past behavior, the fact of the matter is that a liability cap is needed to entice consent from the companies to modify their speech and limit their advertising and marketing practices. 
Second, this legislation now contains tax and spending measures which have nothing to do with the underlying purpose of reducing teen smoking. By approving amendments to add tax relief and anti-drug spending to the bill, we have usurped valuable funds for medical research and public health efforts to combat teen smoking as well as put in jeopardy funds for tobacco farmers, tobacco workers and their communities as they transition into a new era. 
Third, this legislation relies on highly regressive taxes to accomplish its goals rather than individual responsibility. If raising the price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack was the only way to tackle the problem of teen tobacco use, I would not hesitate to assess it. But I don't believe that is the case. In my view, there is too little certainty on the question of what will actually stop teens from smoking to assess such a large and regressive tax on adults. Since only 2% of the cigarettes purchased are actually used by children, I would prefer a much more precise approach than a tax on the other 98%, particularly when that tax disproportionately affects lower income individuals. A much better approach in my view is to enhance marketing and advertising restrictions, toughen retail enforcement, and make adolescents more accountable for the decisions that they make, like taking away their car keys if they use tobacco products. 
In sum, Mr. President, I said from the outset that I was not only willing to support a tobacco bill but believed it was in the best interests of the country to resolve these issues. I applaud the President for his leadership on the issue as well as our colleagues who have worked in good faith to create a fair and effective bill. But this bill, as it currently stands, has become a patchwork of initiatives that are entirely unrelated to the issues surrounding tobacco and teen smoking. For this reason, I cannot in good conscience lock in the current provisions of this bill by voting for cloture. I sincerely believe that this body has the ability and the desire to craft a piece of legislation that is both an effective tool in the fight to reduce teen smoking as well as an effective resolution of all issues surrounding tobacco. 
I don't intend to give up on resolving these difficult issues and I look forward to working with those colleagues who sincerely want a bill, not just an issue. 
I believe we can and will succeed in due course. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the motion to strike the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana, title XV. I have a very high regard for Senator Lugar. He and I have worked closely together on the Foreign Relations Committee, and we have fought to open foreign markets and to promote free trade. I share his tenacious belief in the free market. Harnessing the drive that motivates individuals to succeed yields the benefits of a free market. But government has a role in checking the excesses that can flow from an unfettered free market. 
The market won't educate children. The market won't protect workers. The market won't check monopolies. And the market won't safeguard our natural resources. Left completely unchecked, the free market will always seek the lowest cost, even at the expense of other social goals. So our charge, as policymakers in a capitalist economy, is to allow individuals and entrepreneurs and businesses the freest rein possible while safeguarding society's other concerns. 
Defining those concerns and implementing those safeguards without destroying the benefits we achieve from the free market is one of the most difficult tasks we face. The Lugar-McConnell provision eliminates the Federal program that limits the amount of tobacco that can be produced in the United States. 
Arguments advanced for killing the supply-limiting program center on the desire to see a free market in tobacco. Since the argument is to create a free market, we ought to examine just what benefits we would gain from such a system. Economists estimate that going to a system allowing unlimited production of tobacco would likely increase the amount of tobacco grown in the United States by 50 percent. 
This increased supply would cause the price of tobacco to decrease by approximately 30 percent. Without a tobacco program, tobacco could be grown anywhere in the United States, so it is likely that tobacco would be grown in many more States than it is grown in today. That production would migrate from where it exists in many areas today with hilly terrain and small farms to larger, flatter farms. 
So the benefits to be gained from going to a free market would be cheaper tobacco, more tobacco production, dislocated communities, and unregulated production. The small farmer would not be able to produce enough volume at the lower price to make the farming operation economical. Without some certainty as to price, it is unlikely that any financial institution would extend the credit so necessary for small farming operations to survive. Therefore, if the tobacco program were to be wiped away, the only true beneficiaries would be large corporate farms and tobacco companies, because tobacco would then become cheaper. 
The public health community has increasingly focused on what would happen if we eliminated a program to restrict the amount of tobacco production in the United States and has concluded that the benefits are simply not worth the costs. They note that it would be the height of irony if--in the same bill where we increased the regulation of the manufacture, marketing, advertising and retailing of tobacco--we deregulated the production of tobacco, which is why the public health community, including the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Public Health Association, and the American College of Preventive Medicine all support retaining a supply-limiting program. 
In fact, these public health groups, and a number of tobacco grower associations, have been meeting for a number of years, which has admittedly intensified since June 20 of last year, to see whether they could find common ground. 
I am proud to say that these discussions have been under the auspices of the University of Virginia and involved a number of growers from Virginia. 
From these discussions, the groups were able to agree on a set of core principles. The first of these core principles is that a tobacco production control program, which limits supply and which sets minimum purchase prices, is in the best interests of the public health community and the tobacco producer community. 
The public health groups support controls on production because they cannot support what would happen without them: Uncontrolled tobacco production, plummeting tobacco prices, devastated farm families and farming communities, and enormous benefits for the tobacco companies. 
Despite the opposition of both the grower community and the public health community, there are those who continue to insist that the market in tobacco must be unfettered and uncontrolled. 
The argument for eliminating the supply-limiting program is a philosophical one, focusing on the natural benefits of a free market regardless of the consequences. But the aim of a free market system is to insure that the consumer efficiently gets the lowest-cost product. 
We want consumers to be able to get the highest quality, lowest-cost products, like cotton shirts and cereal, and anything else you can think of. 
The argument for a free market in cotton, wheat, corn, or any other commodity, is to lower cost to benefit consumers and increase exports. This tobacco legislation, however, is seeking exactly the opposite goal. The very heart of this legislation is to have the Government interfere in the free market by raising prices to reduce consumption. 
It is highly ironic that some of those calling for a free market for tobacco voted a couple of weeks ago to have the Government add the cost of $1.50 to the price of a pack of cigarettes. That is not a free market, Mr. President. In fact, the entire aim of the comprehensive tobacco legislation is to increase the cost to consumers, not decrease them. 
Eliminating a tobacco program to achieve a free market system would destroy existing communities and the livelihood of existing farmers without realizing the goal of a free market, which is to increase efficiency and lower costs to the consumer. 
There is no other agricultural product that faces this unique situation, where the Government's policy is to increase the costs to the consumer, not decrease them. 
Tobacco is simply unlike any other commodity covered by the Freedom to Farm Act. The Freedom to Farm Act did not authorize the Government to run advertisements telling people not to use the farmers' products. 
The Freedom to Farm Act did not tax cotton shirts, or cereal, or ethanol to raise the revenues that went to make the payments to farmers. The Freedom to Farm Act did not limit the Government's ability to open foreign markets. 
In short, there are few parallels that can be drawn between the commodities covered by the Freedom to Farm and tobacco, other than that the commodities are all grown by decent, hard-working, dedicated people whose lives are profoundly affected by what we do. 
Tobacco is also different in another crucial respect, which bears directly on the question of whether eliminating the tobacco program would in fact produce a free market, which is the stated aim of the proponents of the Lugar-McConnell provision. 
A market that is dominated by a limited number of buyers, by definition, is not a free market. And that is the situation with tobacco. There are four buyers in the marketplace who purchase 98 percent of the tobacco produced by our Nation's 124,000 tobacco farmers. 
The economists, of course, have a name for such a controlled market. It is called an `oligopsony.' According to the Encyclopedia of Economics, `oligopsony exists when a few buyers of a commodity or service deal with a large number of sellers.' According to this text, this `situation can lead to tacit collusion among buyers to depress their buying prices generally at the expense of the sellers who supply them.' One of the examples they give for an oligopsony is `markets for leaf tobacco.' 
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines oligopsony as `a market situation in which each of a few buyers exerts a disproportionate influence on the market.' 
So that is the market that these farmers would face if they had to deal individually with each of the four major buyers. This would not be a free market. This would be a market where the buyers would dictate the price to the sellers and reap the rewards. 
In fact, the USDA estimates that by `terminating quotas and phasing out price supports, cigarette manufacturers and leaf exporters are projected to have windfall gains of about $800 million annually . . . The cigarette manufacturers would continue to receive this windfall over time once the price support system is phased out. Over 25 years, this windfall could amount to $20 billion or more.' 
The money the companies save would be money that formerly went to tobacco farmers. Eliminating the program would result in a transfer of money from farm families to cigarette manufacturers of about $800 million annually. 
In the face of all this, why do some still want to eliminate a production controlling program? 
One of the arguments I have heard is that tobacco is bad and so the Government shouldn't be involved in it. 
Mr. President, this whole bill, however, is about Government involvement in tobacco. It makes little sense to have the Government involved in controlling every aspect of cigarette making and selling except the production of the key ingredient. The Government is not promoting tobacco, it is restricting it. 
A supply-limiting program limits supply. That does not promote tobacco. The fact that farm families benefit from that restriction, in my view, is not a reason to abolish the program, because without the program, it is not the public's health that would benefit, it is the companies'. 
There are those who advocate reducing the number of tobacco farmers in this country. Under the LEAF Act, we provide a voluntary buyout, which we believe will encourage but not force tobacco farmers to move to other pursuits. We believe that is a sounder and much more humane approach than the one advocated by proponents of the Lugar-McConnell bill which simply pulls the rug out from under farm families after 3 years and forces them to scramble for survival. 
In fact, the comprehensive legislation we are considering is likely to be incentive enough for many farmers to make a transition out of tobacco farming. As consumption falls over time, as counteradvertising mounts, and as economic development funds start creating infrastructure in tobacco communities, there will be migration out of the tobacco fields. 
Tobacco farming is hard work, and while it is more lucrative than growing other crops, it does not make the average tobacco farmer rich. In fact, the average farm income of a tobacco farmer is less than $22,000 a year. If we can create opportunities in tobacco growing communities for children to pursue other paths, that is what we need to do. But that cannot be done in 3 years, and I believe it would be cruel to try. 
There are those who support the Lugar-McConnell provision because they foresee the death of the tobacco program. Programs, however, do not die of natural causes. They have to be killed. And those who vote for the Lugar-McConnell provision are voting to kill the program. So do not be fooled by those who vote for the Lugar-McConnell provision saying they support the program while voting to kill it. 
Finally, I strongly oppose the Lugar-McConnell provision because I believe it holds out false hope. Under the provision, farmer compensation would be paid out over 3 years. Under the LEAF Act, farmer payments would be paid out over 10 years. In order to make the payout over 3 years, we would have to dedicate over 40 percent of the proceeds from the legislation to farmers during those first 3 years. That 40 percent is more than the share to the States, more than the share to medical research, and more than the share to public health. And when you consider that we have already diverted funds away from these accounts, with the addition of the Coverdell amendment and the Gramm amendment, the addition of a mandatory 3-year buyout under the Lugar-McConnell provision would collapse this bill's budget. 
I urge my colleagues to look at the numbers. In the first year after this bill is approved, the National Tobacco Trust Fund would receive total revenues of $14.4 billion. Yet, to make the payout over 3 years, as the Lugar-McConnell provision mandates, we would have to spend over $17.2 billion in the first year. And that is without spending a single dime on medical research or public health programs. 
Are those who support the Lugar-McConnell provision willing to take away money from medical research and public health programs to finance a 3-year buyout? Are they willing to eliminate the so-called marriage penalty tax cut or the antidrug programs offered by Senator Coverdell to pay for this plan? Because voting to retain the Lugar-McConnell provision will make it impossible to fund each of these other programs contained in this bill. 
The LEAF Act, in contrast, recognizes the funding constraints of the underlying legislation and would not take funds away from the other programs contained in this bill. This is not to say that I wouldn't very much like to be able to pay the growers over 3 years, and, in fact, a number of us tried to figure a way to get compensation to growers in less than 10 years. Unfortunately, there were simply too many other competing demands on the funds. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I oppose in the strongest terms elimination of controls on the production of tobacco. It would destroy small family farms, decrease tobacco prices, increase tobacco production, and transfer wealth from growers to the companies, all without any discernible benefit to the people. 
For these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the motion made by the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, to strike the Lugar-McConnell amendment and to support the LEAF Act. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to return to a discussion of the bill that is currently before the Senate. I voted against cloture today, and barring some major shift in the direction of this legislation, which now, regrettably, appears unlikely, I will have no choice but to vote against cloture again tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I have a keen interest in the pending legislation. I have three children, all now grown. No member of my family smokes now, and I hope they never do. In the Senate, we represent millions of parents who have the same wish for their children. There are thousands of Virginians who belong to the American Heart Association, the Virginia Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, Virginians who have fought for years against the scourge of smoking-related disease. 
There are also, however, thousands of honest, hard-working, God-fearing, law-abiding, taxpaying Virginians whose lives and livelihoods would be dramatically affected solely by the actions this Congress may take on the tobacco issue. For example, there are thousands of Virginians who work to manufacture tobacco-related products, and thousands more who work in associated industries, like the dock-workers at the Ports of Hampton Roads, foil manufacturers, and filter makers. And there are the thousands of Virginia families who work the soil and grow tobacco, who face not only the uncertainty other farmers face regarding the weather and other uncontrollable forces, but must contend with the added uncertainty of what Congress may do to affect their lives. 
In short, to an extent not shared by many of my colleagues I represent virtually every interest affected by this legislation. While some would argue that because I'm from a tobacco state I must be biased on this issue. I believe that because I'm from a tobacco state, I'm in a unique position to be objective. I'm willing to listen with an open mind to public health advocates, who want to protect the Commonwealth's children, but I'm also willing to listen with an open mind to tobacco workers and tobacco growers whose very livelihood is under attack. Indeed, I've worked closely with both the public health community and the tobacco grower communities--as well as the tobacco worker communities--whose concerns were not fully represented in the June 20 agreement. 
I have believed from the outset that a resolution of the issues surrounding tobacco is in the best interests of all interested parties--children, the public health community, tobacco workers, plaintiffs, tobacco companies, tobacco farmers and their communities. I've said that from the very beginning and my position has not changed. 
I still want very much to support comprehensive legislation that will address these concerns. Comprehensive legislation, however, must be reasonable. While by its very nature complicated legislation will not be perfect in any one individual's eyes, it must be fair and responsible. And indeed, it must meet its stated objectives. I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that as it now stands, this legislation has lost sight of its objective and will do more harm than good. 
When we began this process of crafting legislative solutions to the problem of tobacco use among our children, we all understood it would not be easy. We knew that difficult and complicated issues needed to be addressed, and consensus would be hard to reach. But as I stand here today, I've become convinced that this effort has hopelessly faltered, tripped up by an unholy alliance of those who wanted to toughen the bill and those who wanted to kill it. We've lost our focus on our original goals. The lure of money to pay for both expensive tax cuts and federal programs, and the politics of punishment, have unfortunately proven irresistible. 
We had, and regrettably for now we've lost, an historic opportunity to address underage tobacco use. While I did not agree with every element of the proposed resolution of tobacco issues that emerged with the original settlement agreement on June 20, 1997, I did see it as a chance to resolve many of the issues surrounding tobacco that have proven intractable in the past. 
The process of reaching the conclusion was not perfect, and there were parties who were not invited to participate, most notably in my view the tobacco growers and tobacco workers, to the extent their interests did not coincide with the companies'. But the framework for a resolution was there, representing compromise by the states, the tobacco companies, and the public health community. 
A carefully crafted, moderate compromise, however, is no match for a hot political issue. Between those who focused on punishing tobacco companies, and those who focused solely on opposing a tax increase, we have a political free-for-all. And these two factions, one of which believes it is protecting the children and the other which believes it is protecting the taxpayer, have united to create legislation in its current state that has become unworkable, irresponsible and unlikely to solve the problem it is designed to address. 
This legislation should be about developing a plan to stop children from using tobacco products. And I do not doubt the commitment of those who have worked so hard on this bill to achieve a reduction in youth smoking. In my view, however, the amendments to the underlying bill that we have adopted recently do not get us closer to that goal. To the contrary, they make the essential compromise unreachable. 
It is clear that the advertising and marketing rules the FDA put in their regulations represented the outer limits of what the government could do to restrict speech without the consent of those being restricted. To entice consent from the tobacco companies to modify their speech, the bill contained a cap on the amount of money a consenting company could be required to pay during any one year. That cap did not shield any company from paying any judgment rendered by a court; it merely regulated the time period over which such payments would be made. 
During the amendment process, we've witnessed the emergence of an unlikely coalition of those who seek to punish the companies and those who seek to kill the bill who teamed up to strip that provision from the bill, virtually ensuring that no company will consent to greater restrictions, and preventing us from further limiting the advertising and marketing practices of the tobacco companies which many have come to the floor to denounce. However gratifying that vote may have been for some, I believe that amendment moved us away from our objective to combat teen tobacco use. 
I believe the absence of liability protection does even further damage to the goal of the legislation. Without some limitation on liability, a `Powerball' plaintiff could hit a jackpot with a lone jury and walk away with the keys to the company. If that occurs, the company's funds will not be there to spend in the public interest as elected representatives see fit, but will be spent however the winning plaintiff sees fit. No funds for counter-advertising, no funds for smoking cessation programs, no money for cancer clinical trials and, yes, no money for farmers. This is a perverse result, which may satisfy a short-term craving for revenge but will leave the programs we want to support starved for funding over the long-term. 
A better approach, in my view, would be to eliminate punitive damages for prior bad acts in exchange for a substantial up-front payment by the tobacco industry. This approach would have the benefit of allowing those `punitive damages' to go toward the public good, rather than to plaintiffs and their attorneys who `hit the jackpot.' 
Without liability protection, a single runaway jury could wipe out a major U.S. corporation, without any corresponding public benefit except the satisfaction of some from `slaying the beast.' But it would come at great social cost. It would destroy the jobs of those employed by those companies, and all of those in related jobs whose livelihoods depend on the company. And because there would still be a demand for cigarettes, other companies, both foreign and domestic, would simply step into the market and continue selling cigarettes, so there would be no guarantee of any perceptible public health benefit. I'm not convinced that this is the most rational course. 
I'm also uncomfortable with the look-back provisions. The look-back provision sets up a performance standard, requiring certain goals of tobacco use reduction by minors. If those goals are not met, a strict liability scheme imposes penalties on those who manufacture tobacco products. While I certainly favor performance standards, I question their application when meeting the standard is not within the control of the entity charged with reaching it. Meeting the goals of the look-back provisions depend entirely on controlling the behavior of adolescents. 
I'm not convinced that either the government or the tobacco companies really know how to control teen behavior, and while we should certainly try to develop methods of eliminating the use of tobacco products by adolescents, I don't believe we should assess damages against companies if those strategies don't work. The way the look-back provisions are currently structured, if the tobacco companies do everything this legislation requires them to do, and it doesn't work, they are still assessed damages, regardless of culpability. I believe this overestimates the power of the tobacco companies, because it requires companies to be responsible for the behavior of adolescents. 
Finally, with regard to the tax increase on tobacco products, I'm not unalterably opposed to raising the price. In fact, I voted against the amendment that would have eliminated any tax from this bill. I have in the past supported necessary tax increases when I believed them to be in the national interest, such as the 1993 deficit reduction package which has helped spur the economy. But I believe we should think long and hard before levying a tax that disproportionately taxes those at the bottom of the economic ladder. If we determine that raising the price by $1.10 per pack is the only way to tackle the problem of teen tobacco use, then I believe we have an obligation to assess it. But given the uncertainty as to what will actually stop teens from trying to act like adults by smoking, it seems to me we should try other approaches first. A massive, regressive tax ought not be the first resort, it should be the last resort. 
In its 1996 regulations, for example, the Food and Drug Administration indicated that marketing and advertising restrictions, and tougher retail enforcement, could cut teen tobacco use in half. While that estimate was likely overly optimistic, I think that we can expand upon the approach taken by the FDA to achieve the goal we all share. In the proposed rule, the FDA stated that `the agency has examined many options for reducing tobacco use by children and adolescents, and believes an effective program must address the two following areas: (1) Restrictions on cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales that will make these products less accessible to young people; and (2) restrictions on labeling and advertising to help reduce the appeal of tobacco products to young people along with requirements for a manufacturer-funded national education campaign aimed at those under 18 years of age to help reduce the products' appeal to these young people.' I would prefer enhancing these proposals, and determining whether they can solve the problem, before assessing a major tax on adults. Since only 2% of the cigarettes purchased are used by children, I would place emphasis on a far more precise tool than a tax on the other 98%, unless such a tax is the only weapon left in our arsenal. 
For example, I would like to focus more on requiring those children who smoke to accept some short-term consequences of the decisions they make, such as taking away their car keys. 
This is the type of approach that would be a more exact tool. But it is not to say that I could not have supported some look-back provision, or some tax increase, so long as they were contained in an otherwise balanced bill and the proceeds targetted toward supporting and enhancing the objective. In fact, I agreed to serve on the tobacco task force to try to help develop a balanced approach that would solve the problem. I knew going in that no proposal would be completely to my liking, and I was prepared to accept some less palatable provisions as part of a workable package I could have embraced. 
For example, although I've always believed the look-back provisions were not sound public policy, despite the support they had from the companies, as part of a fair and reasonable resolution, I could have supported this approach. I was willing to accept a certain level of variance from my ideal in the interest of accomplishing the objective. 
This legislation, however, has reached the point where the burden is too heavy and the variance too great. 
I cannot in good conscience support legislation which places too heavy a burden on people I represent without some guarantee that their legitimate concerns would be addressed and without some certainty that the objective of reducing youth tobacco use would be met. All along, I've wanted to achieve the dual goal of reducing teen tobacco use and looking out for the economic well-being of the hard-working people I'm here to serve. 
This bill in its current form no longer has enough emphasis on these objectives, which is why I now am not supporting it. An unusual confluence of those who want to punish the companies and those who want to kill the bill have shaped legislation which many of us who wanted a responsible bill can no longer support. I had hoped to come to a different conclusion about this process. I still believe that a properly crafted global settlement is in the best interest of those concerned about tobacco. A resolution of the issues that have dogged the tobacco industry for decades, if done correctly, would be good for growers and their communities, children, tobacco workers, the tobacco industry, smokers, non-smokers, and the public health community. The uncertainty that now surrounds these issues is good for no one. 
Discussed rationally, I believe we could develop a solution that would address these uncertainties. On the floor of the Senate during an election year, as we all know, rational discourse doesn't always carry the day. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I began this process with an open mind and a sincere belief that comprehensive tobacco legislation that could be both reasonable and effective in reducing smoking among our youth was in the best interest of all parties involved. I would have supported that legislation. But in the last three weeks, in amendments aimed at punishing tobacco companies, we have weakened the ability of this legislation to do what we all say we want it to do: reduce teen smoking. Again, this has been done by an unfortunate alliance of those who want a bill that's too punitive and those who want simply to kill this bill. In the end, I cannot support legislation that brings great and unnecessary economic harm on working people, and does not effectively achieve the benefit of preventing young Virginians--and young Americans--from becoming young smokers. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to just share with those of our colleagues who are watching the floor at this moment a ceremony that I just attended, that a number of our colleagues just attended, for the promotion of then Colonel Terry Paul to Brigadier General Terry Paul, the U.S. Marine Corps. 
This is somewhat unusual, because General Paul has been serving as the Marine Corps liaison in the U.S. Senate for almost a decade. He came as a lieutenant colonel, he was promoted to the rank of full colonel, and this afternoon was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, where he will move across the Potomac to serve as the Legislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps. 
Many generals, officers of the Marine Corps, admirals of the Navy, representatives of the Department of Defense, and some of our colleagues in the House and Senate were there, to recognize an extraordinary Marine and an extraordinary patriot, someone who has worked very, very hard and very, very professionally in a job that many of us appreciate. 
Mr. President, 
during his nearly 10-year assignment with the Marine Corps Liaison Office here in the Senate, General Terry Paul has championed a number of programs--like the M1A1 tank, the Maritime Pre-positioned Forces (MPF), the V-2 Osprey, and the Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAAV)--that have helped sustain the Corps as the premiere expeditionary force in readiness and have helped mold the Corps for the twenty-first century. 
To those of us who worked with him, General Paul has been a strong advocate for his beloved Corps. 
He has poured his heart and soul into every facet of an issue, championing the best interest of the Corps and the nation, regardless of scope or monetary value. 
He has also never lost sight of the individual Marine--working just as hard to secure a piece of gear that would keep a Marine dry during inclement weather as he would for a multi-million dollar modernization program that enhances the overall capability of the Corps. 
As the Marine Corps' representative to the United States Senate, General Paul has also been instrumental in planning and assisting with countless congressional oversight missions here and abroad. 
And as the only Senator serving on all three national security committees, I have personally embarked upon many a mission with General Paul. 
On numerous occasions, I have been grateful for his invaluable assistance to me and to other Members of this body on what are inevitably grueling visits overseas. 
General Paul unfailingly represents the Corps and country with great commitment and dedication. 
Not only does General Paul do his job with extraordinary efficiency, with immense dedication, and with enormous pride, but he also does his job with great humor. 
Whether it's Marine Corps ear-marks in the DOD bill, or racing to an airport in Ashgabat at 0-dark-30, or showing us the mettle of the Marines at Paris Island, Terry Paul is a consumate professional. 
In my judgment, no one has better represented the Marine Corps on Capitol Hill. 
And so, Mr. President, it is with high hopes and great appreciation that I wish General Paul godspeed as he embarks upon this new mission. 
He moves to the Pentagon having contributed greatly to our work here--and having represented the Corps here in the Senate with enormous conviction. 
We will miss him as a regular colleague--or at least an honorary colleague--in the Russell Senate Office Building--but he will be with us in spirit as he moves across the river. I look forward to continuing to work with him. 
I will end by saying: to a Marine's Marine, to a man who epitomizes the motto of the Corps--Semper Fidelis, General Terry Paul. 
And with that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to recognize the extraordinary service of a very fine Marine and a very fine and patriotic American, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to speak briefly on behalf of a fellow Virginian, Patrick Mulloy, who is the Administration's nominee for Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance at the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
In this position, Mr. Mulloy will play a critical role in shaping our nation's future. International trade continues to become increasingly important to our own economic development and it is vital that we strive to improve access to overseas markets for American businesses. The Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance will also play a primary role in strengthening the overall international trade and investment position of the United States. 
Mr. Mulloy has worked for many years in the public sector. He served as a foreign service officer at the Department of State and as an attorney at the Justice Department's Antitrust Division before coming to Capitol Hill in 1983. During his time on Capitol Hill, Mr. Mulloy has worked on most of the international trade and finance issues within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, such as third world debt, international economic coordination and exchanges, trade promotion, export controls and international banking. 
I'm confident that Pat Mulloy will serve with distinction as Assistant Secretary for Market Access and Compliance. As a long-time Counsel for the Senate Banking Committee, he has already contributed a great deal to much of the legislation that has guided our trade policies. I know that the Banking Committee staff will miss Pat Mulloy, but I'm pleased the nation will continue to benefit from his excellent service at the Department of Commerce. 
I urge my Colleagues to approve his nomination.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. I do so fully supporting what the authors of the amendment seek to achieve--a reduction in teen smoking. 
I, too, want to keep tobacco out of the hands of children. And I'm convinced that the best way to achieve that goal is to pass a reasonable, comprehensive tobacco bill. I have not abandoned hope that such a reasonable bill can still be achieved. But I am convinced that this amendment will make it more difficult to pass comprehensive legislation, and I therefore will vote against it. 
For over a year, I have been saying that I believe a resolution of these issues that have dogged the tobacco industry are in the best interests of all concerned, including children, public health advocates, tobacco farmers, workers and their communities, the states and yes, the companies. To achieve the delicate balance that is a prerequisite to enacting such a complex bill, however, we need to remain centered. If the bill becomes too punitive in the one direction, or too protective in the other, we will fail ultimately to take advantage of this historic opportunity to resolve these issues. 
In that same spirit, I intend to oppose other amendments which would, if adopted, make final passage of a reasonable bill much less likely.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, S. 1873 calls for deployment of a limited national missile defense system as soon as is technologically possible. 
Although a case can be made for near-term deployment of this type of capability, I do not believe it is a wise policy to pursue a limited national missile defense system absent any considerations of costs, cost-effectiveness, or treaty implications. In fact, if this legislation were to become law in its current form and unilaterally breach the ABM Treaty, the international condemnation India is receiving for its nuclear testing during the last 48 hours could quickly shift to the United States. 
There is no question that an accidental or unauthorized ICBM or SLBM launch by the Russians or PRC, however remote the possibility, would have devastating consequences. Such a threat alone, it could be argued, merits a limited national defense system. Indeed, there were extensive debates in the late eighties in the Senate regarding ALPS, or accidental launch protection system, as proposed by Senator Nunn. 
But even in the debate over ALPS, it was understood that we should only go forward if it could be made affordable and cost-effective and deployed within the constraints of the ABM Treaty or a variant of this treaty, as agreed to by the Russians. 
Admittedly, the threat situation has changed since the late 1980s. A new ICBM threat, such as a North Korean capability, could present itself in less than 20 years--a relatively short 
timeframe for deploying and refining a system as complex as a national missile defense. Such threats would become even more ominous in the event technology were transferred in part or in whole to a rogue regime, which is unlikely but not impossible. 
Having a viable national missile defense system would not only provide a limited capability for meeting these threats but, far more importantly, it could serve to deter a rogue regime from even expending scarce resources on developing a long-range delivery system. 
And rogue regimes would not be the only nations deterred. One of the most troubling strategic developments of the next century will be the rapid expansion of the PRC's strategic nuclear force through MIRVing--placing multiple warheads on each of its ICBMs--thus multiplying its nuclear strike capability many times over. This is not a remote possibility. MIRV technology is over 20 years old, and press reports indicate that, in fact, the Chinese are testing a MIRV capability. Facing a limited U.S. missile defense system which could, if necessary, be expanded to meet a potential Chinese threat, Beijing might choose to abandon any thought of pursuing this destabilizing course. 
A limited national missile defense could also serve to deter a breakout by signatories, including the United States, Russia, China, Britain, and France, to future arms limitation agreements, especially those involving a very low number of offensive systems where temptations could be high for rapidly rebuilding capabilities in a crisis. 
But we cannot simply dictate deployment of a national missile defense without consideration of costs and treaty implications. Despite decades of multibillion-dollar research and development and testing efforts, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to effectively and consistently hit a bullet with a bullet in either our national or theater missile defense programs, as was demonstrated even yesterday, even in controlled settings against relatively easy threats. 
The reality may be that we can get there only with exorbitant expenditures that will siphon funding excessively from U.S. military programs for other more pressing threats. S. 1873 makes no account of costs and is, therefore, not, in my judgment, a prudent policy. 
A limited capability could probably be achieved within the confines of the ABM Treaty or a slightly modified treaty. But to call for a defense system without regard to the arms control consequences is very shortsighted. 
If our rush to deploy a national missile defense system undermines Russian ratification of START II and, worse yet, pushes the Russians to abrogate START I, the gains of a national missile defense system will be offset overwhelmingly by a restoration of a very costly and destabilizing offensive nuclear arms race. This, again, supports the condition that S. 1873 is simply not a prudent policy. 
Legislation similar to S. 1873, but calling for a cost-effective and treaty-compliant limited national missile defense system, would be a much more sensible and responsible approach. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it is not my intention today to belabor the points, so eloquently made by the principal proponents of this Resolution of Ratification--including the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by the leadership of this body, and the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Foreign Relations Committee--about why enlarging NATO is in our national strategic interest. 
The three national security committees on which I serve have dedicated an extraordinary amount of time to this issue, examining the full ramifications of enlarging NATO in over a dozen hearings, and following that intensive process I remain persuaded, that we ought to move ahead. 
I certainly don't discount the concerns, that have been raised, by a number of highly respected opponents of ratification, most of whom I am normally in agreement with on national security matters, but I find the arguments advanced by the advocates more persuasive. 
I would like to focus my remarks more narrowly on the implications for American leadership in Europe and beyond. The critical notion in my mind, is not simply that NATO is inviting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into its ranks, but that through our leadership, we've played a fundamental role in casting the light of freedom across Europe, and are prepared in peacetime or war, to guarantee the security of these new democracies. 
Keeping the peace is something NATO has been doing well for 50 years. When an entity works as well as NATO has, in fact, the American people tend to either ignore it or take it for granted. Perhaps that explains the lack of widespread public interest in expanding NATO. 
We have come to think of Europe mostly as a market for our goods, no longer as a territory under Soviet threat. Public apathy aside, we forget the lessons of history that made the 20th Century the single bloodiest of all, at our peril. 
On two occasions American isolationism has led to world wars. What we thought was benign neglect of Europe turned out to be an abject failure of our leadership. Harry Truman was right when he said that if NATO had existed in 1914 or 1939, we never would have seen the toll in human lives that followed. 
Mr. President, it is an undeniable fact that NATO has contributed dramatically to Europe's peace, stability, and democracy the past 50 years, and hence to our own security. 
The alliance was integral to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in the 1980s, to tearing down the Berlin Wall in 1989, and to hastening the overall demise of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. 
Now, some wonder, if it is still relevant, and express serious doubts as to whether or not we should expand it. 
Mr. President, it will be decades before we know with any certainty whether central Europe establishes itself in toto as a model of democratic rule, or something less. But it is not difficult to conjure up images of exclusive ethnic and latent ultra-nationalism underlying future conflict. 
The historical legacy of the region generally is worrisome. World War I started with a mere gunshot in Sarejevo. And even recent history in the region shows that stability can't be treated as a foregone conclusion given the conflagration of the former Yugoslavia after Tito. And now Kosovo threatens to inflame the area all over again. 
NATO has performed admirably in restoring a semblance of order in Bosnia. Yet the job is far from finished. We face years of civil and political reconstruction. But NATO and American leadership have made the difference in resuscitating that country. 
Mr. President, Bosnia demonstrates that the stakes are far too great to view NATO as some kind of anachronism. 
NATO is a vibrant, meaningful, omnipresent military institution that helps preserve a favorable security environment. And let me emphasize that it safeguards American vital interests. We don't lead NATO as a favor to Europe. 
Mr. President, perhaps the greatest challenge, or opportunity, in all this lies in developing a partnership between Russia and an expanded NATO. The Permanent Joint Council we've established with the Russians secures an important role for them in the new security architecture of Europe. 
We should welcome their input and value their advice in charting a new course for the Continent. Russia, after all, has been a player in Europe for better than 300 years. We can, and should, pursue those mutual security concerns with Russia that contribute toward peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. 
At the same time, an expanded NATO will retain the right to act independently, as has been the case for fifty years. Its core purpose will continue to be to ensure its own security through collective defense. 
Where there might be disagreements, Russia should not interpret NATO actions as trampling on its national security prerogatives. 
Rather, the aim of the alliance, in Vaclav Havel's words, `is first and foremost an instrument of democracy, intended to defend mutually held and created political and spiritual values * * * [and is] the guarantor of Euro-American civilization.' 
NATO's expansion will erase the artificial lines drawn by Stalin, but is not and should not be perceived as a threat to Russia's security. 
It is in our interest, and we should provide tangible support to further develop Russia as a peaceful democracy. Expanding NATO helps consolidate the hard fought gains of winning the Cold War, and sets a useful example for Russia among its neighbors to continue with democratic reforms internally. 
Mr. President, the working predicate of a number of the amendments before the Senate seem designed to make the accession process more cumbersome and unwieldy. I believe we need to distinguish this particular matter, however, from common appropriations and authorization legislation we amend and consider in the Senate. 
I believe, ambiguity regarding the protocol terms of entry, for example, will have a corrosive effect on our ability to lead the organization in the future. Existing and future members begin to focus more on American conditions instead of affirmative American leadership. 
Mandating a multi-year pause in expansion, for example, would lead us into the same difficulty we encountered setting deadlines for troop withdrawals from Bosnia. Critical national decisions based on carefully reasoned and supported judgments are subjugated to an artificial time line that could actually end up proving harmful to our military interests. 
We need to be flexible rather than arbitrary about future entrants into NATO: If the first round goes well, the Partnership for Peace program will keep the door open for new members. Present and future security considerations will then dictate the pace and scope of enlargement. 
Along these same lines conditioning NATO membership on EU membership strikes a discomfiting parallel between two organizations whose core missions are fundamentally different, one being military and the other economic and social. 
The amendment would, in effect, allow a group of EU nations veto power over a critical decision affecting U.S. national security: our choice of military allies in any future contingency. 
In all three previous rounds of NATO enlargement--Turkey and Greece in 1952, Germany in 1955, and Spain in 1982--it was clearly understood that expansion presaged European economic development and integration as a key benefit, not the other way around. Now, inclusion in NATO will help establish a climate of confidence for these three countries as they seek foreign direct investment and pursue economic integration. 
Mr. President, strengthening NATO by expanding its ranks contributes to a peaceful, democratic, free and unified Europe. As the security landscape of central Europe rapidly changes, we ought to take advantage of this historic moment. A static, cautionary approach misses the opportunity to extend democratic principles across Europe. 
Vaclav Havel, perhaps better than anyone, has stripped away the layers of argument on each side, observing that `if the West does not stabilize the East, the East will destabilize the West.' Europe looks to the United States for leadership, and it is time for us to act. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Resolution of Ratification before us, and oppose burdensome amendments that would weaken an enlarged NATO. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, in submitting a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee examine issuing a stamp to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the death of our first President, George Washington. 
I hardly need to expound on the legacy George Washington has provided our nation--his courageous leadership through the Revolutionary War, his vision as our first President, and his personal example as a citizen. 
I recently joined Senator Warner and Senator Graham in introducing a resolution, S. Con. Res. 83, calling on the country to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Washington's death with ceremonies and activities that explore the life and legacy of George Washington. Given the formative influence of this distinguished man on our nation, I also believe it is appropriate to ask the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to authorize a stamp in honor of the historic anniversary of President Washington's passing. I encourage all of my colleagues to become cosponsors of this resolution so that we can send a clear message to the Committee and our fellow citizens about the importance we place upon President Washington's legacy.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, yesterday I attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a new elementary school in Richmond, VA. It was an important occasion for the city of Richmond because the last groundbreaking for a new public school in the capital city of my State was 13 years ago, in 1985, the last year I had the privilege of serving as Governor. Today, the average age for all public schools in the Richmond system is 55 to 60 years, and two of them have portions of their facilities that date back to 1888, 110 years. 
Last month, Education Secretary Dick Reilly and I visited Chantilly High School in Fairfax County. Even though Chantilly High is a new school, its enrollment is already 20 percent over capacity. Classes are being taught in 17 trailers that have no bathrooms, bad ventilation and are not wired to the Internet. Some classes have student-teacher ratios as high as 27 or 28 to 1. 
I am an enthusiastic cosponsor of the school construction amendment of the Senator from Illinois because this legislation gives important Federal help to cities like Richmond and counties like Fairfax to help build and renovate public schools. It not only addresses one of the most pressing needs our schools face--the urgent need for school construction money--it also represents an eminently appropriate and constructive role for the Federal Government in education. 
If we had unlimited resources, there is much more I would like to do for education, and I support many of the provisions in the underlying bill. But because Federal dollars are limited, we are forced to make decisions on what is most important, on how best to spend the limited Federal dollars we have. 
To me, the provisions of the underlying bill simply do not meet this test. 
In truth, the simple question before us today is this: How can we best invest $1.6 billion on education? Do we help States face their urgent construction needs? Do we give States additional money to help reduce class size? Do we help States incorporate technology into their classrooms and curriculum? If we look into the language of the underlying bill, the answer to every question is no. 
But if we look at the language in the pending amendment and we ask this question--will we help States and localities build and renovate public schools?--the answer is an emphatic yes. 
Mr. President, there is no question the need is great. The Government Accounting Office has estimated that our national school repair and construction needs are $112 billion. Fourteen million children attend public schools that are in need of major repair or complete replacement. In addition, far too many young Americans attend woefully overcrowded public schools. We need to help States repair and modernize existing facilities. 
In order to hire new teachers and reduce class size, we need additional classrooms in which to place those teachers. In order to increase student access to computers and technology, we need to help some existing facilities undergo complete electrical upgrades to support the use of that technology, and as we debate this bill, we cannot be confused about what this bill is and is not. 
Just because the word `education' is in the name, that does not mean that the bill gives money to schools. In truth, this 
legislation will not build a single school or hire a single teacher or help incorporate technology into a single classroom. 
Despite all the rhetoric, this bill is really nothing more than a tax cut for the few when what we so urgently need is a new roof for the many. Encouraging individuals to save their own money is a noble intention, but like every decision we face, we have to acknowledge that there is a cost, and the real cost of the underlying bill lies in every school we don't help build, every teacher we don't help hire, every leaking roof we don't help fix and every classroom we don't help wire for the Internet. 
Again, we have two choices: We can invest $1.6 billion in support of school construction with the pending amendment, or we can spend $1.6 billion on tax cuts, disguised as education money, with the underlying bill. I hope the Senate will support school construction. 
I thank the Chair and yield back any time to the sponsor of this amendment.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I regret very much that I am not in a position to do as my two previous colleagues have done because we have a bit of a dilemma for tobacco farmers. Everyone who has proposed legislation to include the legislation reported out of the Commerce Committee yesterday by a vote of 19-1 makes provisions for tobacco farmers in terms of transition. 
The tobacco reserve fund, however, has been wisely fenced off by the chairman of the Budget Committee so that it might not be raided by those of us who might have other spending plans. But the only source of payment for any of the plans that have been proposed or considered is going to be the money that comes into that particular fund. 
This amendment would simply make available that particular funding, along with Medicare, to fund any of the tobacco provisions that might otherwise bring down tobacco legislation for the tobacco farmers.

In the 1996 farm bill a provision was added in conference that was not considered by the full Senate or by the House but was added in the conference that, in effect, precluded anybody who had a write-down or loan forgiveness from ever being eligible for a loan that was made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware. 
Mr. President, I rise this evening not to offer a ringing endorsement of Mexico's cooperation on drug interdiction in the last year, but to make the simple observation that we should proceed with extraordinary care before using the stick of decertification on a good friend and ally. Initially, I gave serious consideration to supporting the effort to decertify based on the lack of any tangible results on extradition: not a single Mexican national has yet been extradited to the United States for drug trafficing. Not one, even though I realize progress is being made. 
Notwithstanding my concerns on that singular issue, however, and the fact that progress on stemming the flow of drugs has been modest at best, I believe it's important to continue working in close quarters with President Zedillo in hopes of building a better record over the long-term. 
Let's not fool ourselves, Mr. President. Harsh rhetoric, threats, and punitive actions taking the form of decertification will not create goodwill between Mexico City and Washington--just the opposite: bilateral tensions will rise, drug cooperation will decrease, and once more America will be perceived as a sanctions bully. 
That is not a healthy approach to sustaining a crucial relationship with a country that sits right on our border. It's one thing to let unilateral sanctions fly in distant countries and places, but we ought to be very careful to not stir the pot of anti-Americanism, an inevitable result of decertification, with our nearest neighbor. We simply don't need to increase tensions and decrease cooperation with a country with which we share a 2,000 mile border.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment to correct a measure that was in the 1996 agriculture bill. There are $48 million in this emergency bill to provide for direct operating loans to farmers. But most of the minority and small farmers are not able to get to those loans because of a disqualifying provision. This corrects that. We will try to work it out so it will be accepted when it is taken up on the floor. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to improve access to the USDA's lending programs for farmers. 
The emergency supplemental appropriations bill we're considering contains enough funds to allow $48 million more money to be available for direct operating loans. These loans are crucial to farmers, especially in the spring, because they use the borrowed funds to buy the seed, fertilizer and other material essential for planting, which they repay after harvest. 
Unfortunately, there are many minority and socially disadvantaged farmers who will not have access to these critical loan funds because of a provision in the 1996 farm bill. That provision bars a farmer--forever--from turning to the USDA's loan programs if they have ever defaulted previously on a federally-backed agricultural loan. This inflexible provision permanently eliminates the farmers' access to these loan programs, even if the cause of the previous default was the result of racial discrimination against the farmer perpetrated by the Federal Government, or a disaster beyond the farmer's control, or a medical condition which affected the farmer's ability to pay. 
My amendment addresses this situation.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, every day small and minority farmers are struggling to survive. They struggle in the field as they try to grow a plentiful crop, they struggle with the ever unpredictable Mother Nature, and they struggle to compete with large farm operations. They have a very tough job, but they provide us, the consumers, with the abundant food supply we take for granted. Historically, when credit is unavailable from private sources, farmers have turned to USDA to finance land, seed, equipment and fertilizer, or for funds to offset disaster losses. USDA direct and guaranteed operating loan programs allow small farmers to be self-sustaining, successful, contributing members of their rural communities. 
But Mr. President, a little, unknown provision in the 1996 Farm Bill is prohibiting farmers and ranchers from receiving USDA loans if their farm debt has been written off, or forgiven, by the Department in the past for any reason. This provision constitutes a lifetime ban, is more severe than private sector lending policies, and particularly disadvantages small and minority farmers who often have difficulty securing credit. It is a one strike you're out policy and Mr. President, it is simply un-American. 
I believe this provision that prohibits farmers who have had their farm debt written-off or restructured from ever receiving a USDA loan again was probably added to the 1996 Farm bill to protect the public interest. However, it is actually forcing some small and minority farmers into impoverished retirement. 
That is why I rise today to introduce the Agricultural Credit Restoration Act of 1998. While safeguarding the integrity of USDA lending programs, this bill provides credit-worthy farmers and ranchers a second opportunity to participate in lending programs. The legislation, which was formulated by the USDA, eliminates the lifetime ban. It limits eligibility to two write-downs and farmers and ranchers are given a second opportunity to participate in USDA lending programs. Secondly, an exemption from the ban is included for one write-down that may result from a natural disaster or medical condition affecting farmers or their immediate family, or where discrimination by USDA has occurred. Thirdly, the bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to give loan funds for socially disadvantaged farmers to states where need is greatest. 
In my state, Virginia, and throughout the South, farmers have been denied or delayed loans by USDA local agents because of their race. This has been confirmed by USDA and acknowledged by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and President Clinton. This discrimination has forced farmers into bankruptcy and statistics show that the black farmer is dwindling at three times the rate of other farmers in the United States. 
In the Dakotas, farmers were devastated by the great floods of 1997. Due to a terrible act by Mother Nature, they lost everything and had to declare bankruptcy. 
Whether it is a man-mad or a natural disaster, conditions beyond a farmer's control have left him or her in a desperate position. This does not mean these are bad farmers with bad business sense. They have simply experienced bad times, and USDA, the lender of last resort, should not be forbidden from lending these farmers a helping hand. 
Last year, responding to complaints by Virginia farmers, I added $50 million in direct operating loan funding to the 1997 Supplemental Appropriations bill. Many deserving farmers were unable to access these funds because of the lifetime ban included in the 1996 Farm bill. 
Mr. President, it is time to repeal this unjust one strike you're out provision. We need to do so now, before another planting season goes by and farmers are denied the resources they need to get their corps in the ground. 
Small farmers are hardworking individuals with many daily struggles. The Federal government should be there to offer them a chance to survive, not forcing them to move out of the farming business.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to authorize the Coast Guard to issue the appropriate endorsement for the vessel Betty Jane Virginia Registration number VA 7271 P to engage in the coastwise trade and fisheries. This legislation is necessary to resolve an issue regarding official documentation of the Betty Jane's chain of title. 
The Betty Jane was built in the United States in Deltaville, Virginia by an American private boat builder in 1970. It is a 36-foot wood hull, in-board gas propulsion boat, which is planned to be used for the excursion tourboat trade. The builder and the only former boat owner are deceased. The lack of an appropriate affidavit from these persons has left a gap in the chain of title of the vessel. The Coast Guard has informed the owner of the Betty Jane that if the gap is left unresolved, a coastwise endorsement cannot be issued for the vessel, even though the present owner is a U.S. citizen, the only former owner was a U.S. citizen, and the vessel was built in the United States. 
The Congress passes a number of these technical bills every year. I'm introducing this bill today so that the Senate Commerce Committee may act upon it with the upcoming coastwise bill this session.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I rise to address a problem that threatens to overwhelm the Nation's Capital and surrounding jurisdictions: traffic. As our colleagues know, driving in the greater Washington area can raise your blood pressure and test your patience. Our regional traffic jam, which is rated as second only to Los Angeles, will get worse, not better, over the next few decades if we fail to act. 
Projections indicate that the number of people and jobs in this area will grow by about 50 percent over the next two decades and the number of vehicle miles traveled will grow by nearly 75 percent. 
Unfortunately, transportation funding will fall short of our needs by $500 million each year, and this shortfall will be even larger if we don't get the higher funding levels agreed to in ISTEA II. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration predicts that highway funding for the Nation as a whole in 1999 will be $12 billion less than we need just to maintain our current system, and, again, that is assuming the higher funding we have already agreed to in ISTEA II. 
Unfortunately, State funding in Virginia will not be able to make up this shortfall. A recent report by the Virginia Department of Transportation shows that the spending shortfall in Virginia alone will be $1.74 billion in 1999, and this shortfall is projected to get worse, rising to $2.44 billion in the year 2009. 
This paints a very grim picture for the future when our present situation is already intolerable. 
Today, on average, every man, woman and child pays a congestion tax in fuel expenses, lost salaries and productivity, and pollution of $860 every year. Some have predicted by the year 2020 commuters will spend 50 percent more time getting to work. Imagine increasing your drive time from an hour up to an hour and a half or even from 30 minutes up to 45 minutes, depending on where you live and where you work. 
Given our predicament, our failure to act may seem surprising, but when we stop and think about it, the Capital region encompasses two States and a Federal district within a single metropolitan area. And although the area has common needs, it is understandably hard to get everyone to agree. 
Some have suggested creating a regional transportation department to tax the region and build needed roads. But Marylanders really don't want Virginians helping to choose what roads to build in Maryland, and Virginians don't want their tax dollars paying for projects in DC, and District residents don't want their interests overwhelmed by the suburbs. In short, everyone wants to have a say in how he or she will be taxed, how their money will be spent, and where roads will be built in their neighborhoods. 
Earlier today, I submitted an amendment to assist the region in reaching consensus on how to meet its transportation needs. Under this proposal, which my office has vetted with a number of State and local officials and with the Greater Metropolitan Washington Board of Trade, the metropolitan planning organization for this region would come up with a set of projects and a regional funding mechanism to get those projects built. The region would then work toward consensus and an interstate agreement on the projects and funding. 
The amendment that I have submitted offers several incentives for the region to reach agreement on this package. 
First, the Federal Government would provide a small amount of administrative funding to assist the metropolitan planning organization for this region, the National Capital Regional Transportation Planning Board at the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. This board would work to find a way to fund and implement its regional transportation plan, which is ready to go but for the funding. 
I believe the region has no real choice but to look at a regional funding mechanism to meet its needs, because Federal and State money will not be enough to address the spending shortfall. 
I understand that reaching an agreement will be a lengthy process. So the proposal creates a corporation to provide short-term action on transportation needs. The corporation, acting alone, with the express consent of the region, would have the power to issue bonds to pay for regional projects. 
At first, the corporation would obtain revenue by expanding transportation options. For instance, current Federal laws bar single drivers from using HOV lanes in this region during peak hours. This legislation would permit single drivers to use HOV lanes if they pay a toll and if the region agrees to spend the proceeds on transportation. In this way, drivers would have more options than they have today and the region would have more transportation revenue. 
I realize that tolls are controversial, and part of the controversy comes from the fact that toll collection can slow down traffic. This legislation bars the use of tolls if they would result in slowing down drivers. There is no reason the region could not collect tolls through advanced technology, called `hot lanes,' which allows drivers to pay their tolls without slowing down. `Hot lanes' use sensors to measure a driver's mileage on a toll road and bill the driver accordingly, without requiring them to slow down. Obviously, the tolls would not go into effect immediately. As with all the provisions of this amendment, the region would have to consent, as it would have to consent to any proposal advanced by the Transportation Planning Board. 
Finally, this proposal provides for the expedited congressional approval of the region's interstate compact or agreement. Once the region reached consensus, it would not have to wait for Congress to act. This amendment would give automatic approval of the consensus plan unless Congress rejected the plan within 60 days. 
I should reemphasize that this legislation is not intended to impose a solution on the region. Neither the transportation planning board nor the new corporation would have the power to raise taxes or build roads in anyone's backyard. Instead, the legislation is designed to promote cooperation among the local governments. 
The region would have to find a set of projects and a funding mechanism that is fair to everyone. Only a balanced plan could gain the required approval of the regional and State governments. 
In addition, the transportation planning board would need to make sure the plan is cost-effective. Voters and local governments will not agree to extravagant or impractical projects. Voters would have to be convinced that the TPB has come up with an affordable and practical strategy to reduce this region's growing traffic problem. The TPB could come up with any number of solutions to our gridlock problem, but let me describe one possible vision for the region's transportation plan. 
First, we could add an extra lane in each direction on the beltway. 
We could add an additional Potomac River crossing. Alexandria and southern Maryland, in particular, would benefit from a southern crossing to divert traffic away from the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. We could use these large-scale efforts simply to keep up. 
Additional mass transit and alternative transportation are also critical if we are going to reduce congestion and pollution and provide transportation for the disabled and for those who cannot afford cars. 
We could direct funds to maintain, upgrade and expand the Metro system. And to further reduce automobile traffic, we could expand bus service and improve bicyclist and pedestrian facilities. Additional commuter rail and commuter ferry service on the Potomac are also possibilities. 
Finally, we could improve local roads to create a more web-like highway system instead of our current hub-and-spoke 
approach. In the future, more people will be commuting along the edges of DC rather than into the city itself. A plan of this magnitude would probably cost between $8 billion and $15 billion above current spending. 
I should emphasize that the vision I just suggested is that only, a vision. 
The Federal Government could not impose a plan on anyone. Local citizens would participate in creating a regional transportation proposal, and the regional governments would have to consent to any agreement. The State departments of transportation in Virginia and Maryland and the Department of Public Works in the District of Columbia would also have to consent to the agreement. 
The Federal Government would contribute only a small sum, less than $1 million divided over 3 years, for the region to move toward consensus on action. This small investment, however, would yield enormous returns as this region's economy grew in strength. 
More important, this is the kind of investment the Federal Government should be making. Traffic in and around our Nation's Capital is an interstate problem, creating regional challenges that warrant Federal action. Indeed, congestion threatens the very livelihood of our Nation's Capital. 
The Federal Government certainly cannot be expected to foot the bill for every transportation need, and that is not what I am suggesting today. Indeed, I am proposing that the Federal Government should help create a framework for the region to help itself. 
There was some understandable anxiety expressed by the departments of transportation of the States and the District when we began to explore this initiative several months ago. But I believe we have addressed those concerns by giving the jurisdictions involved absolute veto power over any action they choose not to support. 
Madam President, that is the outline of the proposal that I have introduced in the form of an amendment to the pending legislation. It is my hope that we will be able to clear this legislation at the appropriate time so that we can take action upon it. But at this time I simply wanted to explain to our colleagues what it was that was in this particular amendment so they could consider it, and if it is necessary, tinker with any of the specific provisions. We can do so either between now and the time we complete action on the ISTEA II bill, or in conference, or with subsequent amendments down the road if we need to do any fine-tuning. But I thought it was appropriate to provide our colleagues with some suggestions as to how I believe we should approach this particularly vexing problem for our Nation's capital.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and oppose the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky which would eliminate it. 
This amendment, at least, implies that there is something wrong with supporting socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. I see nothing wrong with supporting socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. I believe it is entirely appropriate we do whatever we can, legally, to help small businesses flourish, businesses that might otherwise get swamped by larger, better financed competitors. 
Mr. President, it is a sad fact that as we near the end of this century, socially and economically disadvantaged businesses tend to be minority owned. If we don't focus our attention on helping these businesses succeed, we are never going to achieve the dream of an economically colorblind society. The evidence of this, regrettably, is compelling and disturbing. White-owned construction firms receive 50 times as many loan dollars as African American-owned firms that have identical equity. 
Where DBE programs at the State level have been eliminated, participation by qualified women and qualified minorities in government transportation contracts has plummeted. There is no way to know whether this discrimination is intentional or subconscious, but the effect is the same. This experience demonstrates the sad but inescapable truth that, when it comes to providing economic opportunities to women and minorities, passivity equals inequality. 
If we don't exercise diligence, we are going to stifle businesses owned by qualified women and minorities. It is that simple. 
I do not support numerical quotas and I never have. I would never advocate awarding work to anyone who is, or any business that is unqualified for the task. But I do support lending a helping hand to individuals and businesses that, without special attention, might be overlooked, even though they are perfectly capable of performing the necessary work. 
And that, Mr. President, I believe is the key to eliminating discrimination over the long-term. We cannot simply declare that a world where inequality exists is otherwise an equal world. We need to recognize that inequality and address it by making an affirmative effort to give qualified businesses a realistic chance to participate. 
As Julian Bond remarked recently in a sentiment that I think is right on mark in this case:  
Affirmative action isn't a case of unqualified people getting a leg up, but of qualified people getting an opportunity. 
Finally, I would like to commend the managers of the bill and, in particular, my colleague from Virginia for taking a courageous stand to support the DBE, despite the pressure that I am sure he is getting on this particular issue. 
Mr. President, the managers are on the right side of this particular issue, and I urge my colleagues to support them by opposing this amendment. 
With that, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to note the death of Dr. Wendell C. Somerville, who passed away on Sunday, December 28, 1997. 
Dr. Somerville served his nation in the United States Navy and, at the age of 27, received his call to preach. In 1927, he was ordained in the Mill Neck Baptist Church of Como, North Carolina, by a council consisting of representatives of seven churches. From that time until his death, he pastored the First Baptist Church in Rocky Mount, North Carolina and, in 1934, he served as the first full-time Executive Secretary for the General Baptist State Convention. 
By 1940, Dr. Somerville took on the assignment for which he is most remembered: Executive Secretary of the Lott Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Convention, an organization to which dozens of Virginia churches belong. He served with distinction in this position for more than 55 years when he was unanimously elected Executive Secretary-Treasurer Emeritus, an office he held until his death. During his active tenure, he traveled extensively, making 28 trips aboard and one around the world where he met with foreign leaders in an effort to spread his positive message. 
We cherish his memory as his work touched the lives of men, women and youth alike. Mr. President, I commend to the United States Senate and to the American people the life and public service of Dr. Wendell C. Somerville.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today marks what would have been the 94th birthday of the late Dr. Ted Geisel, better known to most of us as Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss has touched and continues to touch the lives of millions of people with books like `Horton Hears a Who,' `One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish,' `The Cat in the Hat,' `Green Eggs and Ham.' Dr. Seuss' work continues to make reading fun for children and their parents. 
While the good doctor is no longer with us, he left an invaluable gift: works which foster in our children a joy and appreciation for books and the wonderful treasures contained in them. 
To honor Dr. Seuss and his legacy, today has been declared `Read Across America Day,' a day when millions of students and parents, educators, many of our colleagues and others across the country have been engaged in hundreds of events to renew our Nation's commitment to literacy and to teach every child the importance and joy of reading. 
Today, every child should be in the company of an adult who will read to him or her. 
Last week, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution I submitted, along with Senator Jeffords, in recognition of this very special day, and I thank the Senator from Vermont for his comments this morning about this particular event, and several of our colleagues who participated actively in it. 
In addition to my 92 colleagues on both sides of the aisle who cosponsored this resolution, I commend the efforts of groups like the American Library Association, the National Family Literacy Council, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, Reading is Fundamental, the International Reading Association, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the I Have a Dream Foundation and the National Education Association that have organized events across the country in support of this very special day. 
In communities and schools in my home State of Virginia, there are at least 40 events that I know of to promote literacy and reading. Tonight in Culpeper County, dozens of families will attend an event called `Culpeper Reads,' where parents and children will attend a community dinner dressed as their favorite storybook characters. 
Parents will have the chance to sign their children up for library cards, and community members will read with families and explain how reading is used in their occupations. 
In Hampton, VA, Cooper Elementary has planned an all-day event where individuals will read Dr. Seuss' books to children. And just across the river in Alexandria, Mt. Vernon Elementary School hosted hundreds of high school students and community volunteers as they read with elementary students there. 
This morning, I visited Mt. Vernon Elementary School, where I read some of my daughters' favorite books to a class of first graders and to a class of fourth graders. 
After that, I also had the pleasure of reading to about 50 third graders at Patrick Henry Elementary School in Arlington. 
This morning, Mr. President, I was reminded of how much fun it is to see children's faces light up when you read to them. I was delighted to see so many individuals at each school committed to promoting literacy among our children. 
It is my hope that today's activities will motivate individuals to read across America, not just today but every day. 
Mr. President, the best way we can help a child learn to read and want to read is by reading to them and with them as often as possible. Time and again, research has shown that children who read aloud in the early years with their parents perform better in school. 
Experts say that the single most important activity for building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children. Likewise, the effects of illiteracy can be devastating. We know now that 85 percent of high school dropouts and 85 percent of those in juvenile courts are functionally illiterate. Just as alarming is the fact that 51 percent of American high school graduates are functionally illiterate as well. 
In a country with resources as plentiful as ours, the fact that our literacy rates are so low is not only shocking; it is shameful. 
Mr. President, the earlier in life we can interest children in books, the sooner we can get children into the habit of reading. When children have access to books, when their parents are involved, and when their communities are invested in education, children turn to books for information and enjoyment. 
Reading means empowerment. Helping our children understand the value and the pleasure of reading is one of the greatest gifts we can ever give them. Whether it is to obtain knowledge or to understand history, to experience adventure or gather inspiration, we need our children to love reading. But eager and competent readers are made, not born. By taking just a half hour every day to read with our children, we can foster a genuine interest in reading that will stay with our children throughout their lives. 
In celebrating Dr. Seuss' birthday today, Read Across America Day will generate new enthusiasm for reading nationwide. I urge every American today to spark and rekindle our children's and our communities' and our own interest in reading. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask the Senate to proceed under the order already agreed to.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while this Congress was in recess, the President of the United States awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian honor, to James Farmer. The Medal was given to Mr. Farmer on January 15, 1998, the birthday of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., in a symbolic gesture that reminded us again of the value of freedom, and the debt we owe those who sacrificed greatly for racial equality in America. 
Mr. President, James Farmer was one of the six major civil rights leaders of the civil rights era, joining A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis and Martin Luther King, Jr. He helped establish, and later led, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). He was the father of the famous Freedom Rides through the South. He organized and inspired. He placed himself in great personal danger again and again. Today, he teaches civil rights history to some very lucky students at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia. 
Last year, I was pleased to join Congressman John Lewis and others in asking that the President award the Medal of Freedom to James Farmer. Last month, Lynda and I were privileged to be at the White House when President Clinton officially presented the Medal to Mr. Farmer.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as one man who had the privilege to march and demonstrate alongside this dedicated pioneer during the Civil Rights Movement, and another who has long respected his courage and is proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate, we both have enormous respect and admiration for James Farmer. Now, all Americans are being given the opportunity both to learn more about this man and to appreciate his lifetime of contributions to our nation as a civil rights activist, community leader and teacher. 
Yesterday, on the birth date of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President Clinton presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian honor, to fifteen distinguished Americans. We are grateful that James Farmer, one of the `Big Six' leaders of the Civil Rights Movement and the father of the Freedom Rides, was among them. 
As the Nation prepares to officially celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., it is also fitting that we join the President in recognizing one of the great soldiers and leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. In the 1940's, while still in his early twenties, James Farmer was already leading some of the earliest nonviolent demonstrations and sit-ins in the Nation, over a decade before nonviolent tactics became a vehicle for the modern Civil Rights Movement in the South. 
Early in his academic career, James Farmer became interested in the Ghandian principles of civil disobedience, direct action, and nonviolence. In 1942, at the age of 22, he enlisted an interracial group, mostly students, and founded the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), with the goal of using nonviolent protest to fight segregation in America. During these early years, James Farmer and other CORE members staged our Nation's first nonviolent sit-in, which successfully desegregated the Jack Spratt Coffee Shop in Chicago. 
Five years later, in what he called the `Journey of Reconciliation,' James Farmer led other CORE members to challenge segregated seating on interstate buses. 
In 1961, James Farmer orchestrated and led the famous Freedom Rides through the South, which are renown for forcing Americans to confront segregation in bus terminals and on interstate buses. In the spring of that year, James Farmer trained a small group of freedom riders, teaching them to deal with the hostility they were likely to encounter using nonviolent resistance. This training would serve them well. 
During the journeys, freedom riders were beaten. Buses were burned. When riders and their supporters--including James Farmer and the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr: were trapped during a rally in Montgomery's First Baptist Church, Attorney General Robert Kennedy ordered U.S. marshals to come to their aid and protect them from the angry mob that had gathered outside. 
In reflecting on the ride from Montgomery, Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi, James Farmer said, `I don't think any of us thought we were going to get to Jackson * * * I was scared and I am sure the kids were scared.' He later wrote in his autobiography, `If any man says that he had no fear in the action of the sixties, he is a liar. Or without imagination.' 
James Farmer made it to Jackson and spent forty days in jail after he tried to enter a white restroom at the bus station. On November 1, 1961, six months after the freedom rides began, the Interstate Commerce Commission ordered all interstate buses and terminal facilities to be integrated. 
Six years ago, James Farmer told a reporter that while the fight against racism in the 1960's `required tough skulls and guts * * * now it requires intellect, training and education.' 
Not surprisingly, James Farmer continues to do his part. Just as he taught his freedom riders how to battle segregation over three decades ago, he has taught civil rights history at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, for the past twelve years. He teaches his students how to remember and how to learn from history. 
James Farmer has, in truth, spent a lifetime teaching America the value of equality and opportunity. He has taught America that its most volatile social problems could be solved nonviolently. He has reminded us of the countless acts of courage and conviction needed to bring about great change. He has shown us the idealism needed to act and the pragmatism needed to succeed. His respect for humanity and his belief in justice will forever inspire those of us privileged to call him mentor and friend. 
As we celebrate the Martin Luther King Holiday on Monday, and as we honor James Farmer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, let us vow to continue to learn. If we truly believe in the idea of the beloved community and an interracial democracy, we cannot give up. As a nation and a people, we must join together and strive towards laying down the burden of race. And we must follow in the footsteps of a courageous leader, to whom, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, we can finally say: thank you, James Farmer.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution to designate the week of May 2, 1998 as `National Correctional Officers and Employees Week.' 
Mr. President, this resolution gives needed recognition to the vital role that correctional personnel play in our communities. 
Correctional officers and employees put their lives on the line every day to protect the public from dangerous criminals. These brave men and women also protect incarcerated individuals from the violence of their circumstance, and they help prisoners work toward returning to lawful society. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me to recognize the work and contributions of our nation's correctional officers and employees.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I suggest that the lack of time 
is part of the problem that we are dealing with here, as just alluded to by the distinguished Senator from Georgia. This is not the right way to do what we propose to do, even if that is our objective. 
This amendment, crafted by the minority leader's office, would simply provide a procedure whereby there would be input from the local jurisdictions. The problem right now is that this bill was introduced, held at the desk, and there were no committee hearings, no committee votes, no public hearings on the matter. We have heard from countless people who have a local interest. Those jurisdictions--Alexandria, Arlington, Washington Metropolitan Airports Authority, Greater Washington Board of Trade--are against it. Normally, even in judgeships we give the local Senators input on whether the judge who would be sitting in their particular jurisdiction ought to go forward without some additional debate. You do not have the support of either of the local Senators or the local Members of Congress on this. I normally don't suggest this is scientific or pay that much attention to sheer numbers, but the calls are overwhelmingly against proceeding with this. This sets up a procedure so that we can consider it in an appropriate manner. 
With that, I think my two minutes are about up. I ask for the support of this amendment. Senator Daschle has an amendment that is even more precise and specific, if we want to deal with this issue in a very short period of time. But the problem is the lack of time to thoughtfully consider the implications for the renaming, as well as for all of the local jurisdictions concerned. 
With that, I yield whatever time I have remaining.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I was going to go ahead and allow the amendment to be read because it is not terribly long, and I think it is fairly straightforward. 
I am also conscious of the fact that there are sufficient votes to pass the Coverdell bill as it was introduced. I would point out, however, that the bill was not referred to a committee. It was not subject to a hearing and does not have the benefit of any of the local input that would have been so desirable under the circumstances. 
Because local views on this proposal were not considered, I made a speech in this Chamber yesterday reflecting my own views and, I believe, the views of many Virginians. My comments were similar to the views that were just expressed by the minority leader, who spoke more eloquently but came to the same conclusion. 
I mentioned yesterday that I have long personally admired President Reagan's personal courage, his strong convictions, his infectious spirit, and his leadership in the national and international community. But I thought this particular legislation, because it was contrary to the wishes of all of the local governments that President Reagan worked so hard to empower, was simply not the right way to proceed. 
I also suggested that renaming some other international airport, perhaps in his native State of Illinois or his adopted State of California, would be more appropriate. I talked about the fact that the most substantial Federal building ever built in Washington is going to be dedicated in his name on May 5. And I talked about the fact that the next super carrier will bear his name, and that given his role as Commander in Chief and the respect that he generated, not only throughout the United States but around the world, I wholeheartedly endorsed this designation. 
The difficulty I have with the legislation before us is that it directly contravenes the legacy of the man we hope to honor. We have clear expressions of the views of the local governments. Both of the local governments, the City of Alexandria, and the County of Arlington, have expressed their concern and opposition. 
In addition, my predecessor, the first Republican Governor of Virginia in this century, and a former chair of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, was very explicit in his description of the intent of the 50-year lease of the National Airport and Dulles airport, and the autonomy it provided for the Airport Authority. 
I do not quarrel with the characterization of the distinguished Senator from Georgia as to some of the Federal strings that remain attached to that particular legislation. We seldom really ever turn loose anything in its entirety in this body, and I understand that. 
But the bottom line is, in my judgment, this legislation disregards the views of local officials and business leaders, and thrusts the central government upon a local authority that was divorced from the federal government by President Reagan himself. 
The amendment I have sent to the desk simply creates an advisory group which would take into consideration the views of the local community, and the history of a particular facility, before any renaming occurs. 
There may be other approaches to this particular challenge, and in listening to the distinguished minority leader, I believe his approach would be entirely appropriate. 
The problem here is that we are taking up and considering legislation that has not been considered by any committee of the Senate, that has not had any hearing. Indeed, when we have been able to ascertain the views of those who would normally be considered most interested, they have expressed reservations in various degrees. I think it would be appropriate under the circumstances, since the legislation before us today purports to honor the 40th President, if the views of either the President or Mrs. Reagan, who speaks so eloquently for him, were known on this matter. I think that would be helpful to many Members in considering this issue. 
It may be entirely appropriate, after appropriate consultation, to go ahead and rename Washington National Airport. 
In any event, the haste with which we move is designed, I believe, to reflect the coming birthday of President Reagan. And I would simply suggest that some consultation with the family--and specifically the President, or speaking for the President, Mrs. Reagan--might very much be in order. 
A very nice ceremony, I am informed, has been planned for the dedication of the Ronald Reagan Building on May 5. The former First Lady is planning to participate, and I think all the Members of Congress will certainly be there, if not in body, then in spirit. 
So I ask my colleagues to think about what we are doing, and think about whether or not this properly honors the man it is designed to honor. 
The amendment I have sent to the desk will be taken up tomorrow. Again, it would create an advisory group that would deliberate on some of the issues I have raised, and report back to Congress in a timely fashion. It would not preclude any action by the Senate or the House. It would simply provide input from some of the local governments and communities that President Reagan so strongly defended during his long and illustrious tour as President of the United States. 
Mr. President, I request the yeas and nays on the amendment I have sent to the desk.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to note my opposition to the effort to overshadow the name of our first President, which graces the airport that serves as the gateway to the city bearing his name. 
Washington National Airport is located in the Commonwealth of Virginia, the birthplace of George Washington. It lies adjacent to the city of Alexandria, the hometown of George Washington. 
The people of Alexandria are proud to live in George Washington's city and have asked this Congress not to displace Washington's name on the airport. 
In fact, the original airport terminal, whose facade reflects the design of Mount Vernon's portico, was preserved when the airport was recently renovated. 
The people of Arlington County, the local municipality that surrounds Washington National Airport, have expressed their strong opposition as well. 
The Greater Washington Board of Trade, as well as local businesses that would be harmed by this bill, oppose the legislation that has been offered. 
In 1986, Mr. President, legislation was approved by the U.S. Congress transferring the operation of Washington National Airport from the Federal Government to the Metropolitan Airports Authority. 
The Airports Authority is a nonfederal entity established by interstate compact between the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
President Ronald Reagan, who championed State and local control, rather than Federal control, whenever and wherever it was appropriate, was the President who signed that legislation. 
Former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton, a Republican and the chairman of the Airports Authority, said, `Unilateral action by the Congress to take the drastic action of changing the name of the airport is inconsistent with both the spirit and the intent of the transfer.' 
It is highly ironic that this Congress is attempting to impose its Federal will on local governments, a State/local airports authority, and the local business community, in the name of Ronald Reagan, whose career and legacy centers on his deep commitment to limiting the reach of the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, creating a controversy that is contrary to his legacy does not honor Ronald Reagan. 
Like the vast majority of Americans, I have long admired President Reagan's personal courage, his strong convictions, his infectious spirit, and his leadership of our Nation and the international community. 
There are many appropriate ways to honor the name and the legacy of this great American. 
On May 5, we will dedicate the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in downtown Washington. It is the largest Federal building ever built in Washington, DC. Among all Federal buildings throughout the entire Nation, only the Pentagon is larger. 
In addition, Congress has appropriately named the next aircraft carrier after President Reagan in a resolution I heartily supported and was pleased to cosponsor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, on behalf of many tobacco growers with whom I have worked, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco Market Transition Act. The comprehensive tobacco settlement announced on June 20 of last year simply did not include provisions for tobacco growers. This provision is designed to fill that void. 
This legislation is truly the result of a grassroots effort and elaborates the concepts I discussed in the Chamber on November 3. Tobacco-dependent regions realize that their lives will be directly affected by comprehensive tobacco legislation and they want to prepare for that future. 
Key members of my staff and I have worked with tobacco growers, leaders in tobacco growing communities and members of the public health community to develop legislation which will provide a soft landing to those regions that have so long depended on the production of tobacco. 
In short, because Government action is about to erode the value of quota, there would be a buyout of existing quota at $8 a pound. A privatized tobacco program limiting supply would be reinstituted, providing growers with a license to grow tobacco based on historical average production for that grower. To provide long-term economic security in tobacco communities, $250 million will be provided annually for economic development. Finally, a transition payment would be offered to growers as the system changes from its present form to a new one. 
Tobacco quota, Mr. President, represents the amount of tobacco allowed to be produced domestically. Over the years, individuals have accumulated the right to grow a certain proportion of that total quota. This individual quota, this right to produce, has liquid value that can be bought or sold or leased. Many have acquired quota over the years and planned to retire or in some cases have retired on the funds received from selling or leasing quota. When the Government depresses demand for tobacco, it depresses the value of that asset. 
The legislation I am introducing recognizes the value of that quota asset by paying quota holders $8 a pound for the quota they own over 5 years. Once the quota holder has been made whole, a new supply-limiting program would be instituted giving licenses to grow tobacco to actual producers of tobacco. Unlike the present system, those licenses would not cost money to acquire. Eliminating the crushing cost of quota, which adds 40 cents a pound to the cost of producing flue-cured tobacco, will allow these growers to become more competitive even as demand declines in the United States as a result of any comprehensive bill that we pass. By becoming more competitive with imported tobacco, U.S. growers could keep the demand for their product from declining as steeply as demand for cigarettes and other finished products if we pass comprehensive legislation. 
The legislation also provides a transition payment for existing tobacco producers as we move into the new system and provides $250 million annually to tobacco-growing communities for economic development. These economic development funds can be used for local communities to improve education, enhance transportation, promote small business incubators or develop high technology infrastructure. In short, these economic development funds will help keep these communities from exporting their most valuable asset, and that is their children. 
Finally, this proposal recognizes the benefits of a supply-limiting program for tobacco. A supply-limiting program is absolutely essential to stabilize the income of tobacco farmers and to protect tobacco-growing communities from the utter destruction that would follow if the program is totally eliminated. 
A supply-limiting program is also appropriate in the unique circumstance of tobacco. Unlike other commodities where we are trying to lower the cost to consumers, pending Federal legislation is designed to do just the opposite. Every comprehensive tobacco proposal I have seen would increase the cost of tobacco products to lower demand. Indeed, the President said last night that he would approve something up to $1.50 a pack. 
There has been much healthy discussion in tobacco growing communities about whether to retain the current Federal tobacco program or to avoid the annual battles that threaten it and privatize the program, allowing growers and others to operate it. 
This is an important debate. The Federal program has served tobacco-growing communities well for over 60 years, and it is my judgment--and the judgment of many, many with whom I have consulted--that it should not be dismantled cavalierly. 
The question we face is how best to maintain a supply-limiting program that protects tobacco communities. If we could guarantee that the Federal program would remain intact for the next 25 years, that may be the best way to proceed. But I have detected a great deal of unease about whether we can keep the program, and I think many on both sides of this issue are growing tired of annual fights which, if we lose, will destroy many tobacco-growing regions. 
That is why this legislation contains provisions to privatize the tobacco program. For those who have questions about how this program will work, I invite them to assist in answering those questions and improving this legislation. For those who are nervous about such a change, I can say I appreciate their apprehension. It is easier to understand the world as it is rather than how it could be. But I believe this offers us the best opportunity to retain a supply-limiting program over the long term. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that will protect the communities that will be devastated if we fail to act, and will, in the words of the President, make growers and their communities `whole.'

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life and service of William B. Spong, Jr., a distinguished statesman, a former U.S. Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, and a mentor to many of us who entered politics inspired by his extraordinary conviction. 
Bill Spong died in Portsmouth, VA, on October 8, 1997, at the age of 77. He left behind a son, a daughter, five grandchildren, and a legacy of public service to the people of Virginia unmatched in his lifetime. As his childhood friend, Dick Davis, said so eloquently, `the state has lost a leader that may never be replaced.' 
Bill Spong epitomized the professional commitment and personal integrity that was his hallmark. He was a quiet giant. 
The product of two outstanding Virginia universities--Hampden Sydney College and the University of Virginia School of Law--Bill Spong could have gone anywhere and made money. But he went home to Portsmouth, set up a law practice with his friend, Dick Davis, and successfully ran for the Virginia House of Delegates and then the State senate. 
A philosopher once said, while `every man is a creature of the age in which he lives, very few are able to raise themselves above the ideas of the time.' We, in Virginia, will be forever grateful that Bill Spong was one of those rare individuals who thought--and acted--ahead of his time. While in the House of Delegates, he joined a moderate group of `Young Turks' to pressure the legendary Byrd Machine into investing more money into education. And as a member of the State senate in 1958, he exhibited what would become a lifetime understanding of the value of learning by chairing a statewide Commission on Public Education. 
Then, in 1966, Bill Spong made history. In a Democratic primary, he challenged U.S. Senator A. Willis Robertson, a 20 year Byrd machine-backed incumbent, and won by 611 votes. `We called him Landslide Spong,' remembered his friend and campaign manager William C. Battle. 
As a member of this body, Mr. President, Bill Spong focused not on politics, but on policy and principle. `He agonized over legislation in his quest to do what he believed to be right,' his former Press Secretary, Pete Glazer, said recently. 
`Bill Spong was the kind of public servant we all try to emulate,' said Congressman Robert C. Scott, `a man of integrity who courageously stood by his convictions and his principles, even when it might not be the immediately popular thing to do.' As Alson H. Smith, Jr., reflected: `If Bill Spong thought it was right, he did it.' 
Mr. President, Bill Spong was a statesman. 
But 1972 taught us that Senators with great courage can be demagogued and out spent, and Bill Spong lost his Senate seat amidst George McGovern's landslide defeat to Richard Nixon. `In the Watergate year of 1971,' remembered his college friend, and former U.S. attorney, Tom Mason, `Bill Spong became an early victim of the 11th hour 30-second television spots that continue to plague our political system.' `In my judgement,' Mason said, `Bill Spong's defeat in 1972 was one of the worst developments in Virginia's political history.' 
The Senate's great loss, however, was the Commonwealth's great gain, as Bill Spong left this institution to continue his extraordinary service to Virginia. He became dean of William and Mary's Marshall-Wythe School of Law in 1976 and his stewardship brought our Nation's oldest law school from near ruin to national prominence. In 1989, he became the interim president of Old Dominion University in Norfolk. 
`He had a real intellectual bent,' remembered Bill Battle. `He was probably more comfortable as Dean of the Law School at William and Mary than at any other time of his life.' 
`His sense of humor was unbelievable,' Battle continued. `When we were in law school together after World War II, he was always where the trouble was but never in it. It's hard to believe he's no longer around.' 
Mr. President, we may mourn Bill Spong's death. We may remember his life. But we may never know the breadth of his legacy, or the inspiration he lent along the way. No political leader in the Commonwealth was more responsible for my own entry into Virginia politics than Bill Spong. Dick Davis entered public life because he was angry that his lifelong friend--who he described last week as `a great Virginian and a great Senator' --lost his Senate seat. There's no question that Bill Spong was an enormous force in the leadership of our State that began in 1981. 
In fact, in 1977, when I was Lieutenant Governor and our party was fractured and discouraged, I asked Bill Spong to help us put the pieces back together. I'll always be grateful that the Spong Commission Report, as we called it, laid the groundwork for the unity we needed to succeed 4 years later. 
Mr. President, during the time I served as Governor, I appointed Bill Spong to the Council on Higher Education and asked him to Chair the Governor's Commission on the Future of Virginia. The latter produced an extraordinary report that helped guide public policy--and progress--in Virginia for over a decade. Just last summer, I asked Bill Spong to chair a judicial nomination committee to recommend a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. As always, his extraordinary judgement and unique vision were invaluable. 
`Bill worked hard throughout his public and private life to bring Virginians together to make a better world for all of us,' Congressman Scott said. `I will miss his leadership and his friendship.' 
`He never forgot where he came from,' remembered his former press aide, Pete Glazer, `and he died in the city where he was born.' 
`Two hundred years ago, we were fortunate to have dedicated and enlightened leaders of this Commonwealth,' said H. Benson Dendy III. `Truly Senator Spong was such as a leader of our time.' 
I will close, Mr. President, with two eulogies delivered at Bill Spong's memorial service in Williamsburg by Robert P. Crouch, Jr. and Timothy J. Sullivan. Their eloquence is a shining tribute to a man who has been an inspiration to so many.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, farmers face a great deal of uncertainty. The uncontrollable forces of nature or a volatile market can destroy a farmer's livelihood without warning. When the crops are planted, growers worry about whether they'll be enough rain--or too much; whether supply will be too great or demand too small; whether prices will be too low, or production costs too high. For tobacco growers, these unavoidable concerns were compounded when the tobacco industry and the 40 states' attorneys general unveiled their global settlement of tobacco issues on June 20 of this year. The parties did not address how the settlement would affect America's tobacco growers and their communities. 
Much has happened since that time. Congressional hearings have been held, legislation has been drafted, and the President has reviewed the global settlement. A common theme runs through these separate actions, and that theme is that tobacco farmers and the families and communities that depend on them should not be punished by comprehensive tobacco legislation. I believe the President said it best when he remarked during his discussion of the tobacco settlement in September that: 
We have a responsibility to [tobacco growers]. They haven't done anything wrong. They haven't done anything illegal. They're good, hardworking, tax-paying citizens, and they have not caused this problem. And we cannot let them, their families, or their communities just be crippled and broken by this. And, I don't think of the public health community wants to do that * * * We're trying to change America and make everybody whole. And they deserve a chance to have their lives, and be made whole, and to go on with the future as well. 
My staff and I have been working for a number of months on a proposal I believe may offer a means of making tobacco growers whole and providing the resources necessary to expand economic opportunities in tobacco-dependent regions. While we have discussed these concepts with various people, I would like to describe it more fully now so I can get broader feedback from interested parties. In putting together this proposal, we have talked to tobacco growers, local government officials interested in economic development, agricultural economists and members of the public health community. 
To reduce youth smoking, health advocates seek an immediate and substantial increase in the price of tobacco products. If Congress adopts this strategy, it will have a substantial effect throughout the tobacco-growing regions, and I believe we have an obligation to provide a soft landing for the people who would be affected. 
The plan we developed contains several components. First, it would compensate quota owners for the value of their quota, which is likely to be eroded over time by this government action. Second, it would dismantle the existing Federal tobacco program, which has been under annual assault, and reinstitute a privatized supply-limiting program. Third, it would target economic development funds to tobacco-dependent communities, to be used to attract quality jobs and train individuals for them. The effect of these changes, which I will describe in more detail, would be to give quota holders the value of their asset, guarantee that producers retain a program stabilizing the supply and price of tobacco, reduce operating costs to the grower by eliminating the expenses associated with buying or leasing quota, make domestic tobacco more competitive, and provide long-term economic development. 
Buy-out of quota asset.--Tobacco quota refers to the amount of tobacco that can be produced domestically. Last year, there were 1.5 billion pounds of tobacco quota. Today, quota owned by an individual, which represents the proportion of the total amount of domestic quota an owner has the right to produce, is an asset which can be bought or sold or leased. Its value has accrued over time, and for many in tobacco-producing regions it is the major asset used to pay for retirement. Farmers acquire quota throughout their lives so they can grow tobacco to sustain their families, and then in retirement sell or lease it to others for income. A substantial and immediate increase in the price of tobacco products will decrease demand and will reduce the amount of quota. This erodes the value accrued by quota-holders, as their proportionate share declines with demand. Since so many have invested in this asset, many of whom rely on it for retirement, it is appropriate to compensate for the decline in value caused by a radical change in government policy. 
I propose giving quota owners $8/pound for their quota. The funds would be paid out in five annual installments of $1.60/pound based on the 3-year average--1995-1997--of their basic quota. To avoid serious tax consequences, which would be the government giving with one hand and taking away with the other, the funds could be placed in a tax-deferred 401(k)-type plan, or used tax-free to reduce debt associated with acquiring the quota. This program would convert existing quota into cash, it would terminate the existing tobacco quota system, and a new program would be instituted to give growers the right to grow tobacco through the issuance of licenses. 
New Tobacco Program.--It is crucial that we reconstitute some form of supply-limiting tobacco program. Without one, production shifts to large agribusinesses that are encouraged to grow as much tobacco as possible. The price for tobacco would plummet, and many communities where tobacco is now grown would be immediately devastated. A supply-limiting program stabilizes the price of tobacco, so that wild swings don't put small growers out of business, and limits production. While many agricultural commodity programs have moved away from the supply-limiting approach, I believe it is still appropriate in the unique case of tobacco. There is no other farm product where the ultimate goal is to increase the cost to consumers, not decrease it. In addition, the free market isn't so free in the tobacco industry, because there are essentially only four buyers who have unparalleled control over the market. To require farmers to contract individually with the few large buyers is to put the farmers at a gross competitive disadvantage. 
The new tobacco program should be privatized to the extent possible. No one enjoys the annual uncertainty that follows from constant attempts to end the tobacco program. Growers, who benefit from the program, should be willing to take on the obligation of running it. Once all the quota has been bought out, the new system would grant licenses to 
actual tobacco producers. These licenses would go to all producers, whether they were quota holders, tenant farmers or quota leasees. There would be no significant cost associated with acquiring the licenses. These licenses would give the farmer the right to continue growing tobacco, but unlike the previous system that right could not be bought or sold or leased. In other words, that license, unlike quota, would not be a liquid asset. If the grower decided to stop exercising the right to produce granted by the license, the license would be surrendered to the issuing authority, which could then reissue the license to another grower. By wringing the value out of quota through the buy-out, producers will no longer face the expense of leasing or buying quota. Once that cost of operation is eliminated--which represents about 40 of the price of a pound of flue-cured tobacco--the producer can be more competitive, both here and overseas. And by being more competitive, the decline in quota will not be as steep, and growers will not suffer the severe dislocation that a sudden drop in quota would create, whether that drop is caused by decreased demand or increased costs of production. 
I would like to see the creation of a privatized authority that would govern the production, marketing, importation, exportation, and consumer quality assurance of U.S. farm produced tobacco. This authority, which I'll call the Tobacco Production Control Corporation, could have a varied membership, and one option would be to have an authority with 21 members. The members would include the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator of EPA, the U.S. Trade Representative, nine representatives of Tobacco Loan Associations, four rotating representatives of the public health community, one representative from domestic cigarette manufacturers, one representative form the domestic export leaf dealers, one representative from tobacco marketing facilities, one representative from the Tobacco Marketing and Quality Assurance Corporation, and one representative from the agriculture department of a tobacco state university. 
The Tobacco Loan Associations would be comprised of all licensees of each respective type of tobacco. Initially, licenses would be issued to all tobacco growers based on the 3-year average--1995-1997--of tobacco they produced. The Tobacco Loan Associations would issue licenses to control the quantity of tobacco production, and would assure compliance by levying fines. Additionally, they would arrange for financing and administration of price supports, including the right to receive, process, store, and sell any U.S. produced tobacco received as collateral for private price support loans. 
The Tobacco Marketing and Quality Assurance Corporation would be created to determine and describe the physical characteristics of U.S. farm-produced tobacco and unmanufactured imported tobacco, operate a crop insurance program, and assure the physical and chemical integrity of U.S. produced and imported unmanufactured tobacco. This would insure that the tobacco being used in domestically manufactured tobacco products is of the highest quality and is free from prohibited physical and chemical agents. The Quality Assurance Corporation would consist of a CEO hired by the Tobacco Production Control Corporation and a staff experience in the sampling and analysis of unmanufactured tobacco and capable of collecting data and monitoring tobacco production and consumption information. 
These are the elements that could constitute a new tobacco program. Under this proposed program, once the quota holder has received the value of the asset, a new system of regulating the production of tobacco would be created. This approach honors the value of quota, retains the price stabilizing benefits of the tobacco program but eliminates the current costs associated with acquiring quota, making domestic tobacco more competitive in the future. I'd like to acknowledge the insightful contribution of Henry Maxey, a tobacco grower from Pittsylvania County, who first presented this idea to a member of my staff in a meeting a few months ago in the Halifax office of Delegate Ted Bennett. While I've gotten input from an number of people since then, Mr. Maxey should be credited with getting the ball rolling. 
Economic Development.--I would like to devote $250 million annually for economic diversification in tobacco-dependent communities. Unfortunately, the biggest export in many of the tobacco-growing regions is the children. They leave the area because there aren't enough high quality jobs in the community. Tobacco legislation provides us a unique opportunity to address this situation. The economic development funds should be used for two purposes: attracting quality jobs and training people to fill them. 
I believe that economic development activities are best generated from those most familiar with a community's needs. Generally speaking, I believe that economic development funds should go to counties to carry out those activities that best suit their needs. I would envision that the funds would be distributed to localities based on their proportionate share of the amount of tobacco produced annually, which is a rough approximation of how dependent each community is on tobacco income. In order to foster long-range thinking and coordination in the region, the communities should develop and submit economic development plans. In the case where an independent city is surrounded by a tobacco-dependent county, but doesn't itself produce tobacco, representatives from the city should have a voice in the development of the county's economic development plan, due to the economic interdependence of the two independent governments. 
In some circumstances, counties have banded together to form regional economic development commissions, like the A.L. Philpott Southside Economic Development Commission in Virginia. In that case, the commission should be given the authority to coordinate the economic development funds, allowing the various counties to benefit from a regional approach. Such an approach would avoid duplicative efforts to provide the same services or attract the same industries as a neighbor in the region, making the funds more effective. When coordinating the economic development investments, the commission will be required to target a certain percentage of the funds to the most tobacco-dependent counties as determined by their proportionate share of the amount of tobacco produced annually. This approach combines regional planning with local investment. 
The funds can only be used for specific purposes, such as improving the quality of all levels of education in the region, promoting tourism through natural resource protection, constructing advanced manufacturing centers, industrial parks, water and sewer facilities and transportation improvements, establishing small business incubators, and installing high technology infrastructure improvements. We will need to insure, however, that these funds are not used to reduce the amount of funding that would otherwise be provided by the local, State or Federal governments. 
Whenever there is a major shift in a program like the one this proposal contemplates, we need to be concerned about providing a smooth transition. In fact, the uncertainty created by the mere possibility of major tobacco legislation will undoubtedly affect tobacco growers next year, who expect a serious decline in quota because these issues remain unresolved. To make sure that current producers can survive until this new system is implemented over the 5-year buy-out period, we should consider giving a minimum of income protection during this period. One option would be to add protections in the event tobacco quota falls by more than 10 percent from 1997 levels. If that occurs, tobacco producers would be eligible for a $1/pound payment for lost quota from their 1997 level. This is especially important to farmers operating without much margin, as we make the transition to a more competitive marketplace. 
I hope that these ideas generate some discussion and ultimately I intend to introduce legislation incorporating these ideas. My purpose is to find a mechanism that recognizes the changes facing the tobacco industry, and provides some degree of certainty to tobacco growers and their communities so they are not faced with cataclysmic upheaval as a result of those changes. 
I look forward to working toward this particular goal with colleagues who are interested in this particular challenge.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
And I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for yielding me time because he knows, as I have already alerted him to the fact, that I am going to speak against the position that he has taken for so long and with such eloquence. 
And as the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas departs, let me say, I agree with almost everything he said, save one small part of the speech that he just made. And I have joined him in voting against most of those other amendments. 
But I rise today to oppose S. 1292 because I believe the credibility of the Senate is on the line. 
Just last year, 69 U.S. Senators voted to give the President line-item veto authority. As a former chief executive who had the line-item veto authority, as indeed most Governors have that authority, I supported that decision. I did not use it in the way the senior Senator from Arkansas used it, but I had the authority. And I support it because I believe that only the President has the singular ability to reconcile the competing spending interests of all 535 Members of Congress and make decisions that will be based on our national interests. 
Today, unfortunately, we stand ready to emasculate completely the line-item veto authority. 
I realize that many distinguished Members of this body, some of whom have been heard today, many of whom have been heard from on previous occasions, oppose the line-item veto, and have consistently opposed the line-item veto, and indeed believe it is unconstitutional. 
I would concede that it is quite possible that the Supreme Court will declare it unconstitutional when they consider it on the merits in a suit brought by plaintiffs who have standing to do so. But let's not pass a bill disapproving the President's veto of nearly every single project he lined out in the military construction appropriations bill. 
What credibility can supporters of the line-item veto have if, in the first appropriations bill out of the gate, we vote to disapprove the President's action simply because one of our projects is on the list? 
Mr. President, I don't diminish the political difficulty this legislation poses for Members who have projects on this list. I have three projects on the cancellation list that are in my home State of Virginia. Since I believe these projects have merit, I will work to fund them in future bills. While I do believe strongly that we need to develop some objective criteria for the President to follow when making veto decisions, I never thought that the implementation of the line-item veto would be popular with either the President or Congress. 
What I find objectionable about this legislation is that we didn't even try to determine the merits of the President's cancellations except for individual Members within their individual States. Instead, to maximize political support, we gave, in effect, every Senator line-item veto authority in reverse--allowing each Member to decide whether appropriations for his or her own projects would be restored. The result is that funding for 34 of the 38 projects vetoed by the President are included in this bill. 
Is that what line-item veto supporters had in mind last year? It is certainly not what I had in mind, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, quite simply, this legislation is a test of our resolve to stick by our decision to impose a measure of fiscal discipline on the appropriations process. We gave the President the authority. We expected him to use it. Even those who opposed the legislation expected him to use it. And he did. I am simply not prepared to say that all of the President's actions were totally without justification. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this disapproval bill. Passage of this bill will increase the deficit and set a dangerous precedent that I believe will lead to the emasculation of the line-item veto. But most importantly, Mr. President, passage of this bill would illustrate once again our own failure to make the tough choices, our own failure to be fiscally responsible. 
Mr. President, I am under no illusions about what is going to happen in this particular case. But I hope before Senators cast their votes, they will think about what it was they thought they were doing when they voted for the line-item veto last year and vote in accordance with the convictions they had last year when they vote on this bill this year. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, with particular thanks to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who knew I was going to speak against the legislation, which I know he has so eloquently opposed for so very long.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to respond very briefly to my friend and colleague and the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, for whom I have enormous respect. 
I suggest two things: No. 1, that I share the concern about the imperfect process that was followed in this particular instance. I have shared my concerns directly with the White House, and I hope we will not have a repeat of the lack of prior consultation, et cetera. So I am not in disagreement with that particular aspect. 
But the matter of how many dollars are actually involved is not the issue, as far as I'm concerned. It is the principle. If we believe that the President ought to have this particular authority because we believe only a President can reconcile all of the disparate interests of 535 Members of Congress who may have an interest in a project that may not have true national interest, then we have given him the authority to veto that particular item, and given us an opportunity to override it. 
If this particular legislation were designed to collect only those about which there was agreement or only those individual projects which we could consider on their merit, I might well support the distinguished Senator's bill. 
My objection with this legislation is that we have, in effect, taken every single request by any Senator who asked to have one of the items that was vetoed included in this bill and said, `We are going to, in one single bill, notwithstanding whatever merit or lack of merit may be evident in these particular items, we are going to tell the President he can't do that.' I simply disagree. 
Second, I disagree with the principle that if you are for the line-item veto in principle but can't stand the heat when it applies to a project in your particular district, then, indeed, you ought not to be for the line-item veto. 
I would not argue with the basic premise of the Senator's remarks that if the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia's legislation to repeal the line-item veto were offered again today, that it might well garner overwhelming support, although I am in a position to suggest that it might not be unanimous.

Mr. ROBB. If the Senator will yield to respond on that particular matter, Mr. President, I remind the distinguished Senator from Alaska that I could not agree with him more. I think it is wrong. 
I agree with the Senator from Arizona, with whom I discussed the problem earlier, that we ought to establish clear criteria, and those criteria ought to be made known to those who would be affected by them, as well as all the rest of the Members of this body.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I simply acknowledge that no one has been more eloquent or consistent in their position that this is not appropriate legislation. From the very time that I entered this body I have known that the distinguished Senator, who was then chairman of the Appropriations Committee, felt that this was not a proper allocation of power under the Constitution, that it should be reserved for the legislative body. It was not appropriate to give this to the executive branch. 
We have a disagreement on that matter in terms of the distribution of power, but as to the interpretation of the Constitution, I suspect that the Court will probably ultimately verify or validate the distinguished Senator's views and this debate may be moot. 
My concern today, and I accept the Senator's view that nothing in West Virginia is included, but I am concerned if there were 69 of us, if that indeed is the count, who were willing to vote for the line-item veto and now come back simply because there is an item in our States and say we are against it because it happened to gore the ox in our pasture, then we are not maintaining the kind of principle that most Members of this legislative branch believe in in all the other dealings they take part in.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, without the power to amend, this Senator will observe that we would not have had the Bill of Rights, much less the other amendments to the Constitution. So there is a procedure that is set forth for subsequent generations to reconsider the wisdom of the Founding Fathers, and it appears that the Founding Fathers accepted the fact that there might have to be some changes even in their seminal document, the Constitution. 
I don't intend to continue the debate, Mr. President, with the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I understand his point of view. I respect him and I respect him for it. I expect that this particular bill will probably achieve something in excess of 95 votes. So I am not sure that we need to protract the debate on this particular issue.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last spring, a bright young Fairfax County high school senior was murdered while visiting friends in Washington State. 
Ann Harris was an honor student, a student leader, a gifted athlete, and a member of the Virginia All-State Chorus. Although she didn't live to graduate from Mount Vernon High School--where I graduated over 40 years ago--she carried a 3.4-grade point average and had been accepted, early admissions, to Purdue University. Last spring, Ann had a future filled with unlimited possibilities. 
This fall, as I know her family continued to struggle with their loss, many of her friends in Mount Vernon's Class of 1997 left home to attend the college of their own choice. But they left home with a chilling loss of innocence--the innocence of those who don't know what it's like to lose someone you care about to a senseless act of violence. 
We want our young people to be safe. Safe in our schools. Safe in our homes. Safe on our streets. We want them to live and learn and contribute to our country. 
Ann's family joins us in the gallery today. Let us take this time to recommit ourselves to working for a safer America for all our children. Ann Harris deserved a future limited only by the borders of her dreams. And her friends deserved the innocence of not knowing someone--when you're l7 years old--who loses their future to a senseless act of violence. 
I will conclude by commending Ann's family for creating Ann's Campaign for a Safer America. This campaign encourages all of us to live life as their daughter would have lived--to `smile more, care more, love more and understand more.' As the father of three daughters whose smiles have brightened many rooms, I thank you for your efforts.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to correct a wrong that has been done to an unknown number of Federal retirees in computing their annuities. 
Through a letter from Mr. L. David Jones, I was informed that the 1986 Civil Service amendments contained in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act were being misapplied to penalize career Federal civil servants who had some part-time service at the end of their careers. Mr. Jones, and I'm sure many others, was encouraged to transition to retirement by working part-time for several years rather than just retiring after a 30-year career. Imagine Mr. Jones' surprise when he calculated his annuity after 30 years of full-time service and five years of part-time service and realized that he would have been better off if he had just retired after 30 years. 
At first I believed this problem was simply a matter of the Office of Personnel Management misunderstanding the intent of Congress and that the situation could be corrected through administrative action. The Office of Personnel Management, however, has firmly stated that they are carrying out the letter of the law, and any change to the current annuity calculation will require congressional action. 
That is why I am here today. Mr. Jones, and any others who are in a similar situation, deserve to have an annuity that accurately reflects their many years of service. This bill will allow those retirees to have their annuities recalculated to ensure that they are not penalized for not retiring outright. Realize also, however, that this bill does not authorize back payments for any lost annuity--the legislation simply tries to put things right for future payments to retirees affected by this previous error and to ensure that no future retirees are similarly penalized. 
We must also look ahead and realize that any policy which discourages part-time service in these situations threatens to lead to a `brain drain' as baby boomers begin to retire. Many agencies have already expressed concern about their graying workforce and the difficulties they will face as these experienced workers retire. One option often mentioned is to encourage part-time service, so that the experience remains and allows for a transition of responsibilities to younger workers. As it stands now, a civil servant would be ill-advised to agree to that part-time transition to retirement. 
For both of these reasons, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this legislation, and I will work with my colleagues on the Governmental Affairs Committee to see that this bill is considered as quickly as possible.

Mr. ROBB. 
Mr. President, I rise today because I believe the amendment before us is simply another thinly veiled attempt to attack the President's American Heritage River Program and to prevent any American river from participating in this innovative initiative. 
Rivers have always been an integral part of our Nation's history, and throughout Virginia and across the United States activities are already underway to enhance the economic, historic, cultural, recreational, and environmental value of our rivers. Local government officials, conservationists, and riverfront developers, however, have complained that they cannot figure out which Federal programs they can use to pay for their redevelopment and river restoration projects or how to make their way through the red-tape. The American Heritage Rivers Program is designed to lend a hand of assistance to these community-led waterfront projects. The program will assist localities in gaining access to existing Federal resources and will help bring their plans to life. 
Mr. President, the American Heritage Rivers Program is voluntary and locally driven. This is a citizens-up effort to revitalize our hometown rivers. Communities will nominate outstanding stretches of America's rivers and 10 rivers will be rewarded special recognition. Each American heritage river will have access to a river navigator, a full-time liaison who is knowledgeable about the needs of the community and the multitude of Federal agencies and programs that could help meet their needs. The river navigator will help cut redtape and match priorities identified by the community with the services of the Federal agencies. The river navigator, however, will not have any power over local decision-making. 
The American Heritage Rivers Program is solely an effort to increase local access to Federal programs that affect rivers, not to increase Federal management or regulation of rivers. The Federal Government will only respond directly to community needs. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government has the authority and responsibility to coordinate the use of its limited resources in the best possible manner. If Federal agencies already have programs authorized and appropriated by Congress that are relevant to preserving and revitalizing our rivers, then an initiative that will help to ensure these services are delivered more effectively and efficiently is exactly what we need. 
I'm not sure when this program became so misrepresented that individuals suddenly began to fear that the implementation of the American Heritage River Program would place an unprecedented Federal stranglehold on property owners. Today I heard the American Heritage Rivers Program referred to as an aquatic assault on the American people launched by President Clinton. That 13 Federal agencies will participate in the takeover of our Nation's rivers and a Federal employee will be appointed to control all land use and management activities within the designated area. 
My only guess is these fears are rooted in a general distrust of anything that mentions the involvement of the Federal Government. But, in this instance, I find this distrust and these fears unwarranted. 
The American Heritage Rivers Program simply promises to make a better use of existing sources of Federal assistance and will only coordinate the delivery of those services in a manner designed by the community. And communities can terminate their participation at any time. 
Mr. President, the sponsor of this amendment says his constituents want a community-led process that will make the right decisions for their particular community, not a federally dominated process that could dictate to property owners how they can use their land. If that is what the people of Arkansas want, then that is exactly what the American Heritage River Program has to offer. But, Senator Hutchinson's amendment does not improve the American Heritage River Program, it only interferes with the President's initiative. 
This amendment would add unnecessary delays and burdensome requirements to an initiative designed to streamline Federal assistance to community-led efforts. This amendment would even allow Members of Congress to block designations in other regions of the country, where community and congressional support are strong. Additional congressional bureaucracy will only stifle these citizen-led efforts. 
Right now in North Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia, our rivers are under assault and the attack is by a cell from hell, a fishing-killing microbe called pfiesteria. We should be focusing our resources on finding the source of this microorganism and ensuring our water bodies are safe for swimming and for fishing. We should not be considering amendments that attack any new or innovative approaches to river protection and revitalization. That's why Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support the citizens and communities from around the country who continue to express resounding support for the American Heritage River Program and to vote against the Hutchinson amendment which stands in their way to protect and revitalize their rivers. 
I agree entirely with my colleagues from Connecticut and Rhode Island, from whom we will hear in just a moment. 
This was designed to simplify the process. As I listened to the amendment actually read, it will complicate the process. It will add additional burden to something that is entirely voluntary. There is no new money; there are no new mandates; no applicable provision of Federal law is in any way disturbed. This is simply an attempt to help communities that want to enhance both their environment and their prospects for economic development to do so with the aid of a navigator who will simply coordinate the assistance. 
The Federal Government is already authorized to bring to bear on the project. That is what the National heritage river initiative is all about. I hope my colleagues will recognize that by adding a very significant regulatory burden you would very substantially undercut the prospects for the success of this particular initiative. It is entirely voluntary. Anybody who does not want to be a part of it does not have to be a part of it. 
In my own State of Virginia, there is enormous excitement by the business community, by the environmentalists, by all who want to preserve and enhance our environment and who want to take advantage of economic development that flows from it. I hope at the appropriate time, Mr. President, our colleagues will vote against this particular amendment. And with that I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from New York. 
I had planned to make a longer formal statement today, but I will be very brief given the lateness of the hour. Most of the things that I wanted to say have already been said, and in most cases said more eloquently than I suspect I could say them. I really do not enjoy being the burr under the saddle when there is so much euphoria. Many good people have worked long and hard to achieve this compromise which I think is ultimately the only way that the system works in terms of the major proposals that we deal with in this institution. 
I applaud the President and the Republican leadership for working together. I applaud the ranking members and the chairs of the Finance Committee and the Budget Committee. I have had the privilege of working with the chairman of the Budget Committee for almost 20 years. In my prior incarnation as a Governor, Senator Domenici was always one of the most respected Members of either party from Congress on matters that related to fiscal policy. I know for him this budget agreement represents a major milestone. I know how hard he has worked and I know of his personal commitment to fiscal responsibility and to bringing down the deficit. It is real. I have seen him make tough decisions and without compromising his view of the deal that was finally struck between the President and the leadership in Congress. My guess is that he is at least as enthusiastic, if not more so, about the deficit reduction portion than perhaps some of the timing on the tax cuts. 
I would say that there are very few people that I know, Mr. President, who wouldn't like to have their taxes reduced. My problem is with the timing of the tax cuts. We have been making real progress on the deficit in the last few years. We are on the right course. We have, as the Senator from Maryland indicated just a minute ago, some of the most favorable economic statistics and optimistic projections we have ever had. If ever we were going to make real long-term progress, not only in reducing the deficit but in actually beginning to reduce the debt, so that we would not be passing on to our children and grandchildren the kinds of burdens that we continue to accumulate, now is the time to address that challenge. And yet we fail to do so at this particular time. 
We are providing tax cuts that will be gratefully received by many. We are providing incentives for many good programs. And again I applaud the President and the leadership of Congress and all of those who have been involved in this effort. But we are missing an opportunity that may not come again to make a substantial effort toward long-term fiscal responsibility. I am even more concerned that some of the proposals that we are going to pass today will have some very unfortunate consequences in the outyears. 
I think we will have to look back upon our time on watch and answer to future generations as to why, when we had this opportunity, this window of opportunity in our history, when so many of the economic indicators are so good, we were not willing to make the tough choices. 
I voted for the package this morning with a tinge of regret. As I have been committed to deficit reduction for my entire public career, I was disappointed that we failed to include in that particular package some rather modest, but important, restraints on entitlement growth, restraints that made sense for our long-term future. They were among the very first parts of the proposal that we moved away from. Just as we failed to show the political courage to take the kind of steps that we could have taken when respected economists told us what the Consumer Price Index was doing to all of the programs that were related to it and the impact a revision would have on the long term. What we are doing here today is providing the kind of good news in the short term that many of our citizens will respond favorably to, but in the long term all of us are going to have to answer for the consequences of our actions. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I applaud those who have worked hard to reach this particular agreement, but I respectfully dissent. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have an amendment that we have been working very hard to work out. I commend and appreciate the cooperation of the chairman and the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. 
It is an amendment that has been requested specifically by the Secretary of Agriculture to address a very serious problem. We have had documented discrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture against minority and impoverished farmers over an extended period of time. A report that he requested that took 90 days to compile again documented the same problem. We have reports going back to 1995 to document the problem. 
To the best of my knowledge, no Senator who has worked with me or worked on this particular problem has suggested in any way, shape, or form that the problem does not exist and that we do not have an obligation to solve it. The only difficulty that we have run into is identifying the precise offset. The offset that the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture recommended is one in terms of a very small reduction in the crop insurance Program, taking it down from 28 to 27.9, I believe it is. 
I hope that by the time the vote will actually be required we will have resolved this particular question. If we do not, I say and I pledge to those involved on both sides of the aisle that we will do everything we can between now and conference to ensure that we have an offset that is consistent with the programs that the various Members are interested in protecting but, most importantly, addresses this situation. 
The bottom line is that the investigative unit in the Department of Agriculture, unbeknownst to the farmers who were affected by the discrimination, was abolished 13 years ago, and they were relying on that. The Department of Agriculture says they need this particular remedy to solve the problem. 
We will work with the committee and work with the conferees, if necessary, if we can't come up with the right offset. But I hope that this can be accepted, and if it is not, I hope that we get a vote on it--a very positive vote on it. We will certainly work hard to make sure that we have the appropriate offset at the appropriate time. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill that will provide USDA with the resources to reestablish the Department's investigative unit and to improve outreach efforts, ensuring equal access for all farmers in USDA programs. This amendment will allow the Department of Agriculture to resolve the backlog of complaints made by farmers who have suffered racial discrimination at the hands of USDA, and will provide the Department with the resources necessary to eradicate discrimination and improve small and minority farmers' participation in agricultural programs. 
Mr. President, discrimination of any kind is offensive. But it is even more repugnant when it is practiced by people within the Federal Government--the very body that is supposed to come to the aid of the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. Sadly, Mr. President, the Department of Agriculture has had a long history of discrimination against minority and disadvantaged farmers, as well as minority and women employees. 
Mr. President, for too long serving the needs of small and disadvantaged farmers has clearly not been a priority for USDA, and until recently the Department had not supported any coordinated effort to address this problem. In fact, despite decades of documented discrimination in program delivery and employment, USDA acknowledges today they have a backlog of nearly 800 racial discrimination complaints by farmers, some of which have been pending for over 7 years. Even Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman admits that for `far too long USDA has turned a blind eye to serious, pervasive problems with [the] civil rights system.' Fortunately, Secretary Glickman is committed to fixing this long-standing problem, but he needs the tools to accomplish the task. 
Mr. President, I have discovered that although studies, reports, and task forces from 1965 to 1997 have all documented discrimination and mistreatment of minority and socially disadvantaged customers, as well as agency employees, many do not know the extent of these long-standing problems plaguing the Department. 
The reality is black farmers in the United States are dwindling at three times the rate of farmers nationwide--nearly to the point of extinction. 
In December 1996, after a group of black farmers demonstrated outside the White House calling for fair treatment in agricultural lending programs, Secretary Glickman promptly called for a national forum, and appointed a Civil Rights Action Team to conduct a thorough audit of USDA civil rights issues inside and outside the department. 
Within 90 days, the Civil Rights Action Team published a 121-page report confirming 
not only that small and minority farmers had often not been served at all, but in many cases the service provided by USDA appeared to be detrimental to their survival. Minority farmers have lost significant amounts of land and potential farm income as a result of discrimination by USDA agencies. 
Secretary Glickman came to the Capitol just last week and addressed the House Agriculture Committee on racial discrimination. The Secretary admitted that his Department has `a long history of both discrimination and perceptions of unfairness that go back literally to the middle of the 19th century.' The Secretary acknowledged that USDA does not fully practice what they preach, and during field hearings he had spoken to people who had lost their farms and lost their family land, as he said, `not because of a bad crop, not because of a flood, but because of the color of their skin.' The Secretary went on to state his desire to close this chapter of USDA's history and stated his goal is `to get USDA out from under the past and have it emerge in the 21st century as the Federal civil rights leader.' 
I commend the Secretary for his leadership in candidly and openly addressing an issue that for too long has plagued the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I am convinced that his commitment to eradicating discrimination at USDA is genuine, but before we can solve the problem prospectively, we have to focus on the problem at hand, the nearly 800 pending complaints. 
I initially intended to offer an amendment to the Agricultural appropriations bill that would give USDA the necessary authority and resources to eliminate any legal impediments and expedite the settlement of the nearly 800 pending discrimination complaints by farmers against the Department of Agriculture. 
After speaking to Secretary Glickman on Monday, the Secretary indicated that he intends to settle claims out of the Judgment Fund and that he does not view the identification of a funding source as an impediment to entering into appropriate settlements. Because he is persuaded that existing mechanisms can be used to provide appropriate remedies to those aggrieved, my original amendment, at this time, will not be necessary. 
The Secretary did alert me to two areas where he urgently needs additional funds, however. These two areas are directly related to resolving the current backlog of racial discrimination complaints by farmers, and my current amendment addresses this need. 
In 1983, the civil rights investigative unit at USDA was simply abolished. For 14 years, farmers were led to believe their cases were being investigated when in truth they were not. As a result, determinations were being made on some cases based on preliminary findings often compiled by the person accused of discrimination and the backlog of cases has grown to 798 complaints. 
Without investigation, virtually none of the complaints can now be settled. That's why the Secretary needs to reestablish the investigative unit to finally resolve the longstanding problem plaguing the Department of Agriculture. The Secretary's goal is to establish a 34-person investigative unit to address the backlog by July 1998 and to ensure timely resolution of all future complaints, and my current amendment provides the Secretary with $2 million for that purpose. 
Mr. President, the process for resolving complaints has failed our Nation's farmers. Today, we have to give the Secretary the necessary resources so that he may back up his sympathetic words with action. We have to begin investigating these complaints so the farmers' cases, some over 7 years old, can finally be settled. 
Mr. President, the Secretary has also indicated that the funding level currently in the Agriculture appropriations bill for the Outreach for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program is insufficient. My new amendment provides USDA with an additional $1 million to improve USDA outreach efforts. The Department acknowledges that poor outreach efforts are central to the USDA's failure to meet the needs of minority farmers. Increased funding, as well as improved targeting, will improve minority participation in USDA programs and will demonstrate the Department's commitment to serving their needs. 
Virginia farmers have told me the importance of this outreach effort and I agree, equal program access for all farmers is crucial. 
Before President Clinton can lead this country in a discussion about race relations, we must first confront the discrimination within our Federal Government. We must resolve the underlying civil rights problems at USDA to make the system work for both customers and employees. Congress can help those individuals at the U.S. Department of Agriculture actually interested in improving USDA's ability to serve agriculture and our Nation with the necessary resources to provide appropriate remedies for those aggrieved. For it is only after USDA makes amends for its past injustices that they can face the bigger challenge of eradicating discrimination at all levels within the Department of Agriculture. 
Mr. President, if reluctance to resolve these longstanding issues continues much longer, then the problem may well sadly resolve itself. Without immediate action we could lose all of our minority farmers and an important part of our heritage forever. I would certainly hope that no Member of Congress would want to see that happen. 
Mr. President, very briefly, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee. A number of Members in agricultural States presented difficulties with the original proposed solution, none more important than the current Presiding Officer who apprised this Senator of concerns about one of the original offsets. We have now worked it out, where there is agreement on both sides. It is supported by the administration. 
Basically, this reestablishes the investigative unit for the Department of Agriculture.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. As I say, this amendment will reestablish the investigative unit for the Office of Civil Rights. It will provide the additional money necessary for the outreach for minority and socially disadvantaged farmers. This is precisely what the Secretary of Agriculture said is necessary to solve a vexing problem that has been with the department for decades. Literally it has been documented time and time again. 
I thank all Senators who worked on finding the appropriate offsets so we could provide the funding that the department has requested. I believe it has been cleared and approved on both sides. 
With that information, I urge adoption of the amendment at this time.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I recently learned of a dispute between the Department of Defense and a number of contractors regarding the allowability of cost of employee stock ownership plans, known as ESOP's. 
According to the contractors. DOD has retroactively changed its interpretation of the relevant accounting in a manner that will cost contractors millions of dollars and could drive some of them out of business completely. The contractors also say that DOD has improperly applied the standards of a proposed rule even after that proposed rule has been withdrawn. 
I am concerned about the effect this could have on these companies and the employee's retirement plans which could be jeopardized by this action. 
I had intended to attach an amendment to prohibit DOD from applying the terms of the withdrawn rule but because that matter is currently in litigation I will instead withhold that amendment and work this out in conference. In discussions with the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, he expressed concerns about the equity of any retroactive application as well.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the other five Senators who are the original cosponsors of this particular amendment/sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I join in the gravity that they have already expressed and underlined about the situation that exists now in Cambodia. All of us have spent time in the region. Many of us have spent time in Cambodia dealing with the principal figures that are involved in this particular incident. I myself have visited Phnom Penh on a number of occasions. I have met in Cambodia with First Prime Minister Ranariddh, as well as Co- or Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on a number of occasions there and on at least one occasion here. I am familiar with the difficulties. I watched the process evolve. I observed the time period when the United Nations forces were there helping to try to restore a semblance of stability and to try to develop some respect for the rule of law. We saw elections. Ninety percent of the people in Cambodia voted in those elections. We know the difficulties that existed from the very outset. 
As my colleagues who fought in Vietnam have already suggested, we have a clash of leadership. Co-Premier Hun Sen is a strong and forceful leader. All of us who have met with him understand that. This, in effect, internationally is an appeal for him to understand that the United States cannot abide the conduct that he has been associated with or that has been carried out in his name in the last few days. We cannot stand by and allow additional genocide, additional violence, which is beyond the rule of law, to be condoned. 
I happened to be the sponsor of a resolution several years ago that provided for the collection of information that would be essential to any international tribunal that may deal with the atrocities that were committed by the Khmer Rouge in that terrible period under the leadership of Pol Pot and others who were involved in that particular period of genocide in Cambodia. Much progress has been made on that front. 
Much progress was being made in terms of understanding in Cambodia for the rule of law and some essential elements of peace. All of this represents a setback. It is essential, as this resolution suggests, that the United States exercise its leadership, working with ASEAN, getting ASEAN to get involved as it is at least demonstrating some initial signs of doing even though it is not a military organization, and the international community to speak with one voice and say to those who would purport to represent the violent approach to taking and seizing power that is not obtained through the ballot, that the international community will not support you. 
That is what this resolution that the six of us who fought in Vietnam are saying to our Government, please take a leadership role in mobilizing the international community to send a very strong message to Hun Sen and those who follow his lead and send a message to the rest of the international community to fall behind the progress that has already been made in Cambodia and not to step back with the actions that have been taken in the last few days. 
We want to tell Hun Sen and others who might follow that lead that not only we cannot support that, we are going to be actively opposing that and hope that the rule of law and some degree of political pluralism and respect for the principles of peace and democracy could be restored. 
With that, Mr. President, recognizing the presence on the floor of my colleague from Nebraska, the junior Senator, Senator Hagel, and in joining with Senator McCain from Arizona, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and Senator Cleland from Georgia, I am pleased to support this particular amendment in the form of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I ask all of our colleagues to do likewise. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Presidential Management Intern, or PMI, program. I would request that Senators Mikulski, Sarbanes, Warner, Kennedy, Torricelli, Rockefeller, Santorum, and Kerry be listed as original cosponsors. 
President Carter established the PMI program to recruit graduate students with excellent management potential and public policy backgrounds to the Federal work force. As many of us know, either from working with PMI's in Federal agencies or even having them on our staffs, these men and women have provided valuable services to our country in a wide variety of areas. Since the program's inception, over 3,500 men and women have participated as PMI's with over half of those remaining in government service today. 
At a time when many have denigrated Federal employees, I believe we should recognize the outstanding commitment and abilities of these individuals and the program which has worked to ensure that our Government has civil servants of the highest caliber. For that reason, I and my colleagues are introducing this resolution to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Presidential Management Intern program and recognize the outstanding men and women who have participated in it.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their handling of this bill and for their help in bringing it to this particular position. I particularly want to commend my friend, the ranking member, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, for his advocacy of this particular amendment. I am pleased to join as a cosponsor with the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Arizona and others. But I recognize it is a very difficult amendment for all concerned, as the Senator from Michigan so eloquently explained a few minutes ago on this floor. I know his particular State was more impacted in terms of strategic air base closures. 
My own State is more dependent on defense spending on a per capita basis than any other State in the Union. Year after year more defense dollars, per capita, are spent in Virginia than in any other State. So this is not a popular or easy issue in my own State. But I have tried to analyze the reasons why most of those who do oppose this particular amendment are opposed. It seems to me, Members are opposing another BRAC round for three principal reasons: No. 1, unwillingness to endure the pain of another closure round; No. 2, concerns about the accuracy of estimated savings; and, No. 3, concerns over the integrity of the process. 
Regarding the pain of closures, I can only say that I see the choice as a simple one. We can either preserve jobs and facilities in our own States or we can provide desperately needed funding to ensure that our troops can fight and win in future wars, which, of course, is the reason that we have a national defense capability in the first place. By virtually every expert estimate, early in the new century we will simply be unable to fund a force necessary to support a very prudent and measured national military strategy. 
During the cold war, our massive base infrastructure had substantial duplication built in because of enormous uncertainties about the scale and consequences of a strategic war with the Soviet Union. Much of that duplication we probably could have done without, but I would certainly concede that military construction in Members' home States or districts has undeniable appeal politically. But we no longer have the luxury of duplicating infrastructure just to keep the folks back home happy. 
As many have noted, every dollar we keep spending on bases we don't really need is a dollar we cannot spend on maintaining end strength, replacing aging weapons systems, advancing our military technology to ensure dominance of the future battlefield, and keeping quality of life at a level that will ensure strong recruiting and retention. 
The second rationale for opposing a new BRAC round stems from the assertion that because we don't know exactly how much we saved from previous BRAC rounds, that we should not go forward until we do. If we accept this rationale, however, we would never have another round of base closures, which I suspect would be just fine with many who cite this reason for opposing the effort. But if our net savings from another BRAC round are significant, although indefinite, it seems to me we ought to move forward now. Why should we postpone doing what we know we are going to have to do anyway, just because our estimate of savings are imprecise, as long as we know they are significant? 
The reality is that the long-term savings from the first four-base closure rounds will exceed $5 billion a year when they are completed. It just so happens the Secretary of Defense is still seeking approximately that much money to meet the modernization objectives that he set forth in the Quadrennial Defense Review. New base closure commissions, if they are courageous enough to close the bulk of the remaining excess bases, should add billions in additional savings. If Members want to conduct more studies on exactly how much has been and will be saved by BRAC rounds, that's fine, but let's not hold up this process for a study that we know will tell us that billions will be saved. 
The third reason Members are opposing a new BRAC round is their concern about the integrity of the BRAC process in light of the attempt to privatize-in-place the work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force depots, or ALC's. To avoid any future ambiguities about this matter, a provision here clarifies that privatization in place will be allowed only if the BRAC explicitly permits this at a military installation. 
None of these reasons for opposing another base closure round, in my judgment, is compelling. The responsible thing to do, I believe, for our Nation's security is to cut excess infrastructure as soon as possible. Waiting will only delay the inevitable and cost our military billions in funds that are badly needed for maintaining force structure, supporting training and day-to-day operations, and adequately funding modernization. 
I urge my colleagues, in this case, to make the responsible choice, the choice that the Secretary of Defense, that all of the service Secretaries, that all of the service chiefs and that 
all of the CINC's agree is the only responsible choice, and that is to begin another round of BRAC closures as soon as possible. 
With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

It is close to 70-30 now. The tail being the support of everything else. If we want to support force structure, if we want to be capable of carrying out our commitments, we have to cut infrastructure. The savings start as soon as we begin to cut infrastructure. We can argue about how many dollars later on. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to discuss an amendment I am offering to this year's DOD authorization bill that will make a real difference in the lives of all members of the naval service--and eventually all members of our Armed Forces. It will eliminate many long lines and hours of frustration, it will substantially reduce recordkeeping errors and it will save the DOD and the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. And it represents the next phase of the effective utilization of smart card technology--a technology I have been encouraging and working on for many years. 
Mr. President, when a new recruit joins the service today, he or she faces a long and tedious registration process. A typical new recruit faces hours of waiting in line to fill out forms with his or her name, date of birth, rank, military I.D. number, and so forth, only to be sent over to another line to fill out another form with much of the same information again. Not only is this process aggravating for our new recruits--it is a waste of the Armed Service's time and personnel. It takes dozens of people countless hours to process in each new recruit through this inefficient system, costing the service valuable time and money, that it could be putting to better use elsewhere. 
Once registered, a new recruit is issued a handful of ID's and cards to carry. A typical service member today might be required to carry a general ID card, an immunization card, a meal card, an equipment card, a weapons card, a military driver's license, a vehicle registration, a card to pick up mail, a card to carry if staying as a guest at another base, and if lucky enough to be stationed near some good fishing, a fishing permit. With so much clutter, it is not uncommon for a service member to misplace one of their cards, which wastes even more of the military's time and resources replacing them. 
For years, I have been looking at ways that the military could streamline the methods it uses for its registration and recordkeeping, looking for a way to improve what I saw as an outdated and inefficient system of issuing multiple cards containing duplicate information. 
The Government and the private sector have been using cards for years as a means of information storage. Many of the earliest cards had just a name and number much like the Social Security card that is still in use today. As the need for increased security and efficiency in the transfer of information from a card grew however, we saw the introduction of cards that relied on new information storage systems like bar codes and magnetic stripes, much like the kind found on today's credit cards, ATM cards, telephone calling cards, and in dozens of other card-based applications. And as the technological capabilities of cards have increased, so has the number of cards that each of us carries every time we leave our residence. 
Mr. President, we now stand on the brink of a new explosion in card technology, one that promises to offer us even greater convenience and efficiency in everyday life, saving money and time while increasing our control over the information we provide to others. After years of research and development, I am pleased to report that a new user-friendly card technology will soon allow us to replace the handful of cards now used in the DOD with a single, multiapplication `smart' card. 
Mr. President, with the amendment that I am offering today, next year, under a pilot program that I have been working closely with the Department of Defense and the Department of the Navy to develop, a new recruit will not face the long and wasteful lines, the duplication of information or the cumbersome bundles of cards that many of us remember. Instead, upon arriving at boot camp, each new sailor and marine will be issued a single card: the MARC card. Short for Multitechnology Automated Reader Card this card will be used across the entire Navy and Marine Corps next year, and if it works as well as some of us believe it will, we will then extend it to all of the Armed Forces. 
The MARC card is a remarkable achievement. The MARC card can carry your security clearance. The MARC card can carry your meal information. The MARC card can hold your immunization records. The MARC card can serve as your room key. 
Mr. President, the long-term savings that will result from this program will be substantial; the improvements in the increased speed and quality of services will be enormous. With the MARC card, we can reduce support infrastructure, thereby improving our tooth-to-tail ratio while making our sailors' and marines' lives easier. 
The MARC card is one of the first widespread applications of the most exciting new card technology on the market today: the smart card. Smart cards, like the MARC card, rely on an integrated circuit chip--a microchip--to store more information and data than was ever before possible on a single card. Within each card is a small microprocessor along with a sizable memory capacity, which gives each smart card the capabilities of a small microcomputer. 
The capabilities of the smart card are so great that a single card can perform all of the functions that this entire stack of cards that I am holding up right here used to perform of still perform today, for that matter, and will perform dozens of new time-saving applications as well. Unlike older cards, the smart card is easily updatable, and has the capability to constantly take on new information. 
Yet the real strength of smart cards, like the MARC card lies not in the convenience of carrying so much information on a single card, but in the money that we can save as a result. By harnessing the strength and memory of a small computer inside of a portable plastic card, a multitude of new applications can be offered that will increase the efficiency of Government, cutting down expensive and unnecessary administrative costs while reducing waste, fraud, and abuse at all levels of government. 
Mr. President, I have seen this card in action, and the savings and increased efficiency it can offer the members of our Armed Forces are really impressive. 
In the past, when our sailors would dock at a naval base upon their return from sea they faced a long and tedious process of waiting in line after line to check in to their shore station. Often taking up to a week a sailor would need to fill out countless forms to register for quarters, for medical treatment, for security clearance, for his next assignment, for the mess hall et cetera. 
But today at the Smart Base in Pascagoula, MS, the first naval base to automate its operations using the MARC card, a sailor who arrives off of the U.S.S. Yorktown faces a check-in time of just a few minutes. 
By simply walking up to a kiosk, he can insert his MARC card into a reader not unlike an automatic teller machine, and within seconds be assigned his quarters and other necessary information, while personal data needed by the command is simultaneously zipped electronically around the rest of the base. His MARC card even serves as his room key. 
Not only does this process save sailors a lot of wasted time, but it reduces the number of administrative staff needed to check in an entire ship. To process every sailor from an arriving ship, a base need only have a handful of staff on hand and a few kiosks that interact with the MARC card. 
Mr. President, the MARC card can improve the efficiency of every operation across the military. Let me give you an example. Today, when a sailor or marine heads to a mess hall to eat, he has to show his ID card, as well as his meal card to one of the duty personnel, who tediously records the information from both cards by hand into a ledger. After each meal another officer must spend hours reconciling who ate what on that particular day, at a great expense both in the time involved and the money it costs. On average, it takes a mess hall 4 to 6 hours a day to account for all the meals that are eaten. 
With the MARC card, however, sailors and marines will simply swipe their cards through a reader as they enter the mess hall and be automatically accounted for by a computer. Anyone who tries to sneak an extra meal without paying is caught in the act, which helps the Navy reduce fraud. After each meal, the officer in charge of the mess hall will only need to call up a file on their computer to account for the meals served. The total time involved is reduced from several hours to just a few minutes. 
Not only will this project save the Navy time and money--the food service savings alone will save over $2 million in the first year, a savings of 49 percent--it will also allow our Armed Forces to allocate more resources to the duties they most need to focus on. From security access to dining hall access, from checking out weapons to checking out library books, the MARC card can save the Armed Forces thousands of hours a year in wasted administrative costs. 
The $36 million I am asking for in this amendment does not authorize any new spending--it only redirects the use of $36 million within the Navy and Marines O&M account that has already been authorized by the committee. Because the MARC card program has been so effective in reducing the costs of general administration in the military, our investment of $36 million in an expansion of the MARC program will save the Navy and Marines O&M account many millions more in fiscal year 1998 and beyond. 
By investing $36 million, in the MARC program, the Navy's project manager, estimates that the savings to O&M from using the three MARC applications, already in place across the Navy and Marines will top $134 million in FY 98. 
Now that's just the savings from using the MARC card in three applications--Food Service, Security Access, and Clearance Verification. 
As other applications are deployed, the savings may top $200 million in just FY 98, and well over $500 million over the next 5 years. 
Mr. President, with the budget situation, that we face today we are compelled to look to all areas of the government to eliminate needless administrative services and streamline the many duties that our government performs. 
In this era of reinventing government, smart card technology has potential applications not just in the military but all across the government. 
By eliminating long waits in lines at government agencies, by eliminating the manual entry of data all across government agencies, by doing away with duplication of data across the government by eliminating fraud, smart cards can slash the administrative costs of government while improving the quality and speed with which many government services are delivered. 
Mr. President, the technology is here, in our hands, and the savings to be had are real, immediate, and substantial. I firmly believe that we should move forward with applying smart card technology, not only in the military, but all across the government. 
Mr. President, I realize that smart cards are still a new technology right now, and that they're unfamiliar to many potential users. 
I am aware that some people are uncomfortable with the idea of having a single card for everything they need. 
Placing so much information on a single card raises more than a few eyebrows over privacy and security concerns. 
And I know that a lot of people are concerned that by placing so much personal information on a single card an employer might have access to medical records, or a librarian might be able to find out what you ate for lunch that day. 
Let me say that I share these concerns. 
But in fact, Mr. President, while all this information may be carried on a single card, powerful encryption technology ensures that personal information is seen only by those who the individual wants to see it. 
The technology available today allows us to select what information is carried on our smart card and guarantees that we are the only ones who can grant access to that information. 
Even though we can store our financial and medical records on the same smart card the card's microchip is divided into separate compartments that make it impossible for our bank to see our medical records and our doctor to see our last bank deposit. 
And if we should lose our card, anybody who finds it will discover that it's useless to them. 
Because without the proper authorization code that only the individual knows--and with more sensitive applications, without biometric authentication like hand geometry scanners--the card won't work in the hands of anybody but its owner. 
Just as our ATM card is useless to a thief without the proper PIN number, a thief will find that, without authentication by its owner, a stolen smart card is a worthless piece of plastic. 
In an era where our personal information is becoming increasingly easier for others to access, where our very personal and private activities can be electronically tracked, smart cards are a way to return control over this information where it belongs: in the hands of the individual. 
And with modern-day encryption and other security measures built into the chip on a smart card, the information on this card is more secure from theft or fraud than any credit card or ATM card in use today. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt of the need for increased efficiency, security, and portability of information across all sectors of our Government. 
We have the technology, literally, in our hands to make it happen. 
Already, several other Government agencies have begun to implement this technology in a variety of applications across Government. 
Today, for example, smart cards are used as identification and security badges in Government buildings. 
In States like Wyoming, pilot programs are underway to use smart cards to electronically disburse WIC and food stamp benefits. 
In several western States, a smart card called the health passport is being used to increase the portability and accessibility of an individual's medical records while safeguarding their confidentiality. 
At colleges like the University of Michigan, a single smart card can call up a student's financial aid records, buy her books, and open the door of her dorm. 
On our subways, and our military bases, in our hospitals, and our schools, across the public and private sector, smart cards can cut down the time we spend on burdensome administrative work and save us valuable time and resources. 
But the reason I'm so enthusiastic about this new technology, Mr. President, is not just because smart cards can eliminate waste. 
I'm not here speaking today simply because smart cards can save us time and money. 
I'm strongly supportive of this new technology because smart cards can make our lives better and easier. 
Whether it's reducing the time we wait in line at a government office or providing a doctor the information needed to save a life smart cards can make our entire infrastructure more user-friendly and efficient; smart cards make technology work better for us. 
I am confident that pilot smart card programs, like the MARC program, will demonstrate the effectiveness of smart cards and the need for this technology across government, and will lead to increased use of this technology in our future. 
That's why I'm so excited about it, and that's why I'm so pleased the managers seem willing to include this provision in their manager's amendment. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the tax bill before the Senate. Although I supported the budget resolution which allowed for this bill to proceed, I did so to advance the spending cuts that I voted for and the Senate passed earlier this week. I have consistently stood for the proposition that we shouldn't be reducing revenues until we balance the budget, and I will keep that commitment today. 
While I have supported a number of amendments that I felt would make this bill a better package, even if all those amendments had passed, I'd still be opposed to cutting taxes while we still have a budget deficit. Nonetheless, I understand that it is difficult for elected legislators to resist the temptation of tax cuts, and I do not discount the popular appeal of a number of the measures before us, nor do I quarrel with the public demand for them. However, sound fiscal policy compels me to oppose even the tax changes I might otherwise support until such time as the Federal budget actually reaches balance. 
By passing and enacting this tax bill, or any other, we singlehandedly undo the hard work we did in 1993 to finally bring annual budget deficits under control. We've made dramatic progress, bringing down annual deficits from $290 billion in 1992 to an expected $60 billion this year. Now, on the precipice of balancing the budget, we are going to pass a tax cut bill which takes us in precisely the opposite direction. While I understand that these tax cuts are provided for in the context of a balanced budget plan, no one can argue that they will increase the deficit and the debt between now and the year we expect to get to a balanced budget, if we get there at all. 
Not only will this bill increase the current deficit and the long-term debt, the out-year costs will come due at a time when the costs of our entitlement programs begin to swell due to the retirement of the baby boom generation. From now until 2030, the number of individuals who will qualify for these programs will double, going from 35 million to 70 million. Even if we didn't enact this tax cut, all revenues we collect would be needed just to fund entitlement programs and interest on the debt by 2012, leaving only borrowing to cover defense and discretionary investments in human and physical capital. Enacting a tax cut which doubles in cost every 5 years hardly seems an appropriate course to follow given the demographic challenges we confront early in the next century. 
This tax cut would not have been as damaging in the future were we likely to make some of the long-term structural changes in our entitlement programs that would have sufficiently restrained the growth of these expenditures in the future. By abandoning a legislative change for a more accurate measure of the cost-of-living adjustments and the likely elimination of any eligibility changes in Medicare by the time the spending measure becomes law, we compound our long-term fiscal problems with this tax cut. 
Mr. President, the truth is that even if we were in budget balance today and for the forseeable future, I couldn't support this particular tax bill. The fact of the matter is that the tax bill before us does little or nothing to simplify the tax code, fails to adequately encourage new savings and investment, and is structured in a way that masks its long-term costs. Instead, it is largely driven more by political payoffs to special interest groups and polling data, rather than rational tax policy. 
The child tax credit has been roundly denounced by economists as doing little more than encouraging additional consumption, something we clearly ought not to be encouraging at this point given our robust economy. At least the Senate retained the provision that required that the tax savings be saved for education expenses for those with children between 13 and 16, and I commend my colleagues, including Senators Breaux, Kerrey, and Lieberman, who have fought so hard to ensure that the child tax credit provides some economic value by requiring that it goes to savings and investment. 
Many have claimed that both the capital gains provisions and new individual retirement accounts will encourage additional savings and investment, and I would like to believe that is the case. However, the capital gains benefits fail to differentiate between those gains from long-term investment and those from stock speculation, and the new backloaded IRA's will likely result in simply a shift of existing savings to a tax deferred vehicle, resulting in compounding revenue losses over time. 
Compounding revenue loss will also result from the structure of the estate tax relief provisions in this bill. I understand the burden these taxes cause for some families, particularly those with family owned farms and businesses, but the slow phase-in of increases in the current $600,000 exemption amount guarantee that the true cost of the tax change won't show up until after 2007. 
Mr. President, the most difficult part of opposing this tax bill for me has to do with the education incentives included in this bill. From my days as governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I've made education my top priority, pumping over $1 billion of new funds into education during my tenure as governor without a tax increase. I simply believe that the education of our children is the most important function of government at any level. Because of this commitment, I applaud the President's effort to increase access to education. 
I am not opposed to commiting additional resources to education, but my concern about these tax provisions is that they are not likely to encourage students to get a higher education. For the most part, they would simply subsidize those who would have attended anyway. In addition, most education experts believe these tax provisions could result in an increase in tuition costs as institutions use the tax savings to increase their costs, potentially making education expenses even higher for students who can't qualify for these new tax benefits. It also seems to me that those who benefit from these education incentives ought to have some obligation of community service, a cause I have long championed. 
In summary, Mr. President, I voted earlier this week for the spending cuts in the first Reconciliation bill because I believe that deficit reduction should be our No. 1 priority. It is for this same reason that I oppose this legislation on principle and for the substantive policy reasons I have outlined. I understand that it is politically difficult in our day and age to resist the siren song of tax cuts. But I hope that those who intend to support this tax package will be prepared to answer for their vote when the revenue losses begin to mount and prevent our budget from staying in balance over the long term. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of comprehensive, responsible reform of our regulatory process. It has been a long and tortuous journey. Many thought it could not be done. But I'm pleased that it has been done, and I'm pleased to join Senators Levin and Thompson as an original sponsor of the Regulatory Improvements Act of 1997. 
Efforts to reform the regulatory process began long before this Congress, and the legislation we're introducing today is a testament to the tenacity of Senator Levin, who has worked untiringly for responsible changes in the regulatory process for a long time. Senator Bumpers, as well as our former colleagues Senators Johnston, Nunn and Heflin, toiled in these vineyards for many years. 
The reason for this continued effort is clear. Regulations produce enormous benefits for society, protecting workers, conserving our environment, and promoting public health. But regulations also impose a tremendous cost on society. The purpose of regulatory reform is to make sure the benefits of the regulations warrant the costs. 
According to the GAO, expenditures relating to pollution abatement alone exceeded $110 billion in 1992. While this represents only a portion of the costs of regulation, it provides some guidance regarding the magnitude of regulation. If we can maintain the level of pollution abatement, but increase the efficiency in how we attain it, consumers will ultimately reap the benefits. And of course every dollar that a business spends beyond what is necessary to protect us and our resources is one less dollar that could otherwise be used to hire an employee, or fund a pay raise, or pay for a plant expansion. Not only will consumers benefit, but so will the economy. 
Regulating in a cost-effective fashion simply makes sense. If we can achieve the same environmental benefit for less money, or even better, achieve more environmental benefit for the same money, then it makes sense to do so. 
While the debate over regulatory reform has in the past been presented as a choice between the economy and the environment, there is a responsible middle ground. If done wrong, regulatory reform could harm the environment, but if done right, both the economy and the environment benefit. 
As noted by Vice President Gore in November 1995, in announcing one of the administration's regulatory reform initiatives: 
For decades, the American political system pitted the economy against the environment in a false conflict. America's business leaders were pitted against America's environmentalists. It seemed that too often for one side to get its way, the other side had to lose ground, and you had to decide which side you were on, business or the environment. Most people didn't like that choice, because most people, in their hearts, really are on both sides and don't see them as being in conflict. 
I share the Vice President's view that we can protect both the environment and the economy. The benefits of regulatory reform will come primarily from relieving consumers from unnecessary costs and strengthening people's respect for government. In addition, by developing a responsible approach to regulatory reform, we will be able to prove what most of us having been saying for years--that we can be true to our principles to protect people and preserve our natural resources without being antibusiness and antigrowth. 
At the same event in 1995, President Clinton reiterated that growing the economy and preserving our health and environment are compatible goals. The President stated that `protecting the health and safety of our citizens doesn't have to come at the expense of the bottom line,' and that `strengthening the economy doesn't have to come at the expense of the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink.' 
During the last Congress, we witnessed a massive effort to pass an extremely broad regulatory reform bill, offered by former Senator Dole. 
Whether intentional or not, that bill could have lowered the standards regulating our health, our safety and our national resources. 
In addition, that bill was too reliant on litigation to challenge the enforcement process. For example, the process for reviewing existing rules was driven largely by individual petitions each of which were subject to review by a court. That bill also raised the specter that agency rules could be overturned in court for minor procedural errors that were unlikely to have affected the outcome of the decisionmaking process. 
The amount of litigation which would have been created by the original bill, coupled with excessive paperwork requirements, would have led to agency overload. Rather than focusing on producing and enforcing regulations to benefit society, the agencies would have been tied up in court or processing paper. And this problem would only have been exacerbated by deep cuts proposed for many of the affected agencies. 
After the original bill failed cloture for the third time, former Senator Johnston, Senator Levin and I and our staffs spent a great deal of time and energy trying to find common ground. Many Senators from both sides of the aisle were committed to reforming the regulatory process, and we tried to use the synergy of the expertise of Senators Levin and Johnston to develop an acceptable package. Ideas and drafts were frankly exchanged during the many hours of meetings we held. In between meetings, we talked to interested parties, including labor groups, environmental groups, business groups and the administration. The purpose of this excercise of listening and drafting was to determine whether we could craft a responsible middle ground on regulatory reform. 
The three of us came very close to settling on a middle ground, but eventually the 
Presidential campaign made it impossible to complete action. But what evolved from that process last year laid the groundwork for the efforts which began this Congress. With Presidential politics safely behind us, and with a substantially lowered decibel level, Senators Thompson and Levin were able to focus on the critical elements and develop responsible reform. The scope of the legislation has been narrowed to address only those issues which are essential to improving our regulatory process. 
By focusing on the essential requirements of reform, we've avoided many of the pitfalls found in the Dole bill. By narrowing the scope, we've also been able to concentrate our attention on those elements which belong in a regulatory reform bill but which were not resolved satisfactorily in the earlier bill. 
For example, we improved the `look-back process' which provides for the review of existing rules. The Dole bill allowed rules to be placed on the schedule for review either through agency action or a petitioning process reviewable by the courts. The petition process was for those who could show that a rule would fail to meet the decisional criteria. Each petition denied would have been separately reviewed by a court. 
The bill we're introducing today eliminates the courts from the agency review process altogether. The question of which rules should be reviewed will not be the subject of litigation. In my view, this is one of the major improvements in this new version. Rather than having courts decide, through an adversary process, which rules should be reviewed, the bill takes a more rational approach. Under the new bill, an advisory committee made up of a cross-section of public and private interests affected by an agency's regulations will recommend to the agency which rules to review. Agencies are required to give deference to the committee's list, and undertake a review of the rules selected. This will allow agencies to spend more of their time reviewing rules and less of their time in court. 
The most important aspect of a regulatory reform bill is how it will change agency behavior prospectively. We want to encourage agencies to choose the most cost-effective method for achieving the regulatory goal and to select a rule where the benefits justify its costs whenever possible. 
Under current law, agencies are not directed to take those factors into account. In fact, agencies are given broad discretion under current law when developing rules to implement statutes. The only guide an agency must use to develop rules is the language of the statute upon which the rule is based. That is the standard against which an agency's action will be judged if challenged in court. The agency must be able to demonstrate that the rule satisfies the statutory requirement. 
This legislation requires agencies to consider additional criteria in developing major rules. The rule would not only have to meet the standard contained in the statute upon which the rule is based, as required under current law, but would also have to consider whether the rule is the most cost-effective approach and meets a cost-benefit test. If the agency adopts a rule which is not the most cost-effective, or where the benefits do not justify the costs, the agency must explain why it chose that approach. We think consumers, taxpayers, and those 
subject to regulation have a right to know what benefits a proposed rule is likely to provide, and what the costs will be to achieve those benefits. We also think people have a right to know why an agency would select a rule other than the most cost-effective for meeting the objective of the statute. 
The bill broadly defines `benefits' and `costs,' which provides agencies with vast discretion. `Benefits' are defined as `the reasonably identifiable significant favorable effects, quantifiable and nonquantifiable, including social, health, environmental, economic and distributional effects, that are expected to result directly or indirectly from implementation of, or compliance with, a rule.' The term `costs' is similarly defined. 
As I stated at the beginning of my comments, this has been a long, evolutionary process. But I think this legislation we are introducing today represents a responsible approach to improving the regulatory process. And I think it demonstrates what we can accomplish when we set aside partisan wrangling and rely on reason rather than rhetoric to solve complex problems such as this. Once again, I've been pleased to be involved in this process, and I commend both Senators Levin and Thompson for their determination to see this through to conclusion. I look forward to working with my colleagues to improving the product and moving this legislation through the process.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I'm pleased that we've come together in a bipartisan way--both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Capitol, and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue--to craft a plan that brings us a step closer to fiscal sanity. 
The good news, Mr. President, is that the bill before us realizes roughly $137 billion in savings over the next 5 years. And that's good news for our country and for our children and our grandchildren.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
The defense authorization bill before us today does a pretty responsible job of providing adequate funding for personnel readiness, quality of life and modernization. 
It also makes a concerted effort to accommodate many of the recommendations of the Quadrennial Defense Review. I remain concerned, however, as do many colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, that we will face a serious funding shortfall in just a very few years as we try to replace and modernize aging vehicles, ships, and aircraft that will be exiting the inventory in droves just after the turn of the century. 
By accelerating some of the funding for major procurement items in this authorization, we help head off this funding crisis at least to a small degree. 
As a ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I compliment the chairman, Senator Inhofe, for his diligence in supporting U.S. military readiness. 
I am pleased the bill funds many of the high-priority readiness increases requested by the service chiefs in the operations and maintenance accounts, as well as the ammunition accounts. Military construction is well funded, but all adds were subjected to the strict criteria established in the Senate years ago to ensure we only fund projects truly needed by the military. 
The bill does not go far enough, however, in my judgment, in taking on the issue of excess infrastructure. One of the best ways we can pay for future modernization is through reducing the Department of Defense's large `tail' of infrastructure and support, which is taking away critical funding for the `teeth'--our warfighting troops and equipment that will fight the next war. 
The best place to reduce tail is to cut more bases. An effort to authorize a new base closure round failed in a tie vote in committee, but in spite of its political unpopularity, I hope the full Senate will, for the good of the Nation's defense, support a new BRAC round. 
We have reduced force structure by over 30 percent since 1989, but four rounds of base closures have yielded an infrastructure reduction of only 21 percent. Reductions enacted so far will yield, in the long term, over $5 billion a year. 
To gain additional, badly needed savings, the only responsible course of action, in my judgment, is to begin reducing additional excess right away. Although I certainly understand the reservations of those Members who are concerned about the integrity of the BRAC process, in light of the attempts to privatize in place the work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force depots, I hope once those issues are resolved, those Members will support a new BRAC round as well. 
The depot issue remains a difficult one, to say the least. My view is that we must significantly reduce the excess capacity at the air logistic centers, that the spirit of the BRAC was to reduce roughly two ALC's worth of capacity, and that the BRAC did allow for some level of privatization of work at Kelly and McClellan. 
But in no way did the BRAC intend to privatize in place excess capacity. Preserving that excess capacity will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and we simply cannot afford this kind of waste anymore. 
I applaud my counterpart on the Readiness Subcommittee, 
Senator Inhofe, for his willingness to strike the controversial depot maintenance sections of the original bill that threatened to prevent us from proceeding to consider this bill. 
Mr. President, there are other ways to save money so that we can properly fund modernization. 
One is to invest in new technologies that promise to deliver more lethality for less cost. 
This bill aggressively funds the Army's efforts to ensure battlefield dominance through better intelligence, communications and smart weapons. It adds significant funds for the Navy's impressive information Technology 21 initiative, which will enable the warfighter to exchange all types of information on a single desktop computer, shorten decision time lines and better utilize information for combat. 
I will be addressing another technology, smart card technology, that promises to save millions in an amendment later on in our consideration of this bill. 
The bill also sensibly allows a new approach for funding the next carrier, the CVN-77. 
By letting the contractor maintain a steady supplier and workforce base through early funding in fiscal year 1998 for construction in 2002, the taxpayers stand to save over $600 million on this program alone. By authorizing an innovative teaming arrangement for the new attack submarine, we achieve additional savings over a noncompeted, sole-source procurement while preserving two nuclear-capable shipyards. 
Let me offer one other area the bill addresses that could lead to billions in savings without undue risks to military capability. We generally assume that any money for force modernization must come from force structure cuts, end-strength cuts or infrastructure cuts.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, we generally assume that there are no prospects for savings in readiness. The reality is that we maintain most of our active force units at very high levels of readiness at considerable expense, when, in fact, we could relax readiness levels for certain units, especially those not slated to go into combat early. Senator McCain included language in this and last year's bill requiring an evaluation of a concept he refers to as `tiered readiness' where four tiers of readiness are established for our units based on their likely time of deployment to battle. 
I have included language in this bill asking for an estimate of savings from a related concept I refer to as `cyclical readiness.' It would involve alternating a high state of readiness between units, where the units at the high state of readiness would be slated for a first major theater war, and the other lower readiness units would be available for a second theater. 
The services tell us that their operational and personnel tempos are too high to relax the readiness of any units. I have come to the conclusion that much of that problem is self-inflicted through excessive training and contingency requirements. 
I have included another provision in this bill that requires a look at how much of the demands on our troops are, in fact, self-inflicted. 
The reality is that come October, our largest overseas contingency commitment will be about a third of an Army division in Bosnia. 
In my judgment, we don't need to maintain all ten active Army divisions at a high state of readiness, and I believe we need to take a hard look at this matter. 
With that, Mr. President, I look forward to our continued consideration of this bill and yield the floor. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Nebraska for sponsoring this legislation. My own experience in combat in Vietnam, having had over 100 of my men wounded and over 20 killed, seeing directly the impact of landmines and booby traps, I know exactly the kind of devastation they can inflict. In my travels around the world where landmines are a principal impediment to farming and other civilian activities in areas where combat had been previously conducted, I have seen its hideous effects, the maiming of many, many individuals. I am pleased to join Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel in this bipartisan effort to eventually eliminate antipersonnel landmines. 
This legislation reflects a principled first step on our part to halt the spread of these dangerous weapons. If an international consensus is to be achieved ultimately banning their manufacture and deployment, the United States will have to lead by example and restrict its own activities in this area. During peacetime, most Americans reasonably assume that military weapons are safely stored away. That is not the case, regrettably, with landmines. Many countries, particularly developing countries, continue to actively lay mines with tragic consequences. These devices indiscriminately kill or maim an average of 70 individuals a week, or some 26,000 civilians annually. In Bosnia alone, over 250 soldiers of various countries have been injured by landmines. 
Mr. President, two-thirds of the Senate is formally on record supporting a moratorium on our use of landmines. While this does not get to the heart of the issue, in my mind, beginning the process of demining an estimated 100 or more million mines scattered across the world today, and cutting off funds for new deployments, will sharpen the debate on the utility derived from placing landmines, compared to the damage they inflict. 
I recognize this is a debate underway for expedited consideration of a comprehensive ban treaty this year through what is known as the Ottawa conference, or embracing the United Nations approach of negotiating a multilateral agreement over a longer period of time. This legislation steers clear of the controversy by formally endorsing neither, but noting each in hortatory language. Moreover, given the belief of some that landmines continue to function as a useful deterrent on the 
Korean Peninsula, the legislation creates a national security exception for that particular situation. 
We have a long way to go before we rid ourselves of these insidious devices. Someday I look forward to considering a permanent and international treaty banning the production, stockpiling, sale, and use of these weapons. For now, the legislation proposed by Senator Leahy and Senator Hagel is a modest proposal, eliminating funding for new deployments and, in my judgment, it heads us in the right direction and it has my full support. 
With that, I yield the floor. I yield any time I may have.

Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. President, it's hard to argue with the spirit of Senator Lugar's amendment. And indeed I don't argue with its spirit. We owe the United Nations hundreds of millions of dollars. Our deadbeat status is an embarrassment for the country and undermines our standing and the vital work of this international organization. 
That said, the political reality of the situation we find ourselves in is that a majority of this body is prepared only to pay our debts conditioned on comprehensive reforms being implemented at the United Nations. And I certainly don't disagree with reforming the United Nations, and making it more efficient and effective. Still, we are holding hostage money already owed to changes being invoked that suit our unilateral demands. 
But the will of the majority is clear. While I may disagree with my friend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee on the unilateral means which he has chosen to affect reform at the United Nations, the negotiated package providing $819 million over 3 years I believe is the best we can hope for. Half a loaf is better than no loaf at all. And that is the alternative. This is a classic example of a situation where the perfect can become the enemy of the good. 
Mr. President, I would favor an approach that pays our arrearages in full, not in the 2 years proposed by the distinguished Senator from Indiana or the 3 years sought by our distinguished chairman while conditioning future payments on reform. But that strategy fails the political litmus test laid down by the majority. I understand that reality, and I want an authorization bill that can become law. Hence, the circumstances persuade me that the only approach that can accomplish that objective, even though I may substantively disagree with part of it--is the one negotiated between and offered by Senator Helms and Senator Biden. 
It represents a compromise in good faith on both sides to achieve an objective that we have not achieved in this body in some period of time. And for that reason, I support the bill and I oppose with regret the amendment that is offered by my distinguished friend, the Senator from Indiana. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining. 
Again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for yielding me an additional minute.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, nearly 7 years ago President Bush invoked emergency economic sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. Freezing Iraqi financial assets made sense at the time because it prevented Saddam Hussein from funding his war campaign. Now, we need to take steps to unwind the sanctions regime to permit payment to United States businesses who sold products to Iraq but have never been paid. 
Four years ago this month I introduced legislation--S. 1119, the Secured Payment Act of 1993--with 13 bipartisan cosponsors achieving that purpose. The bill clarified that certain moneys on deposit in United States banks belong to United States companies, not Iraq, and therefore should not be subject to the Iraqi assets freeze. Amendment language similar to S. 1119 was appended to the last State Department Authorization bill following a rollcall vote in the Foreign Relations Committee and approved by the full Senate. Unfortunately, the language was dropped in conference, leaving this matter unresolved. 
The legislation I am introducing today represents a compromise on creating a settlement process for private preinvasion claims. The Iraq Claims Act of 1997 I believe takes a progressive step forward in disseminating the $1.2 billion in frozen assets. 
First, it vests currently blocked assets in the President. Second, an Iraq Claims Fund will be created by the Treasury Department where those assets will be deposited. Third, within 2 years of enactment of the legislation, payment on private claims--certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission--will be made out of the fund. Fourth, after payment has been made in full on all private claims, any funds remaining shall be made available to satisfy claims of the U.S. Government. 
Mr. President, although much of the debate over my previous legislation concerned the minutiae of letter of credit law, international business transactions, and economic emergency powers, the Iraq Claims Act of 1997 lays aside those issues and establishes an equitable procedure for considering claims on a prioritized basis. While I understand that the administration is working on a proposal for similar legislation on Iraq claims, I would encourage the State and Treasury Departments to reevaluate their concerns about the approach I am proposing. I would submit that this legislation is the most suitable, and politically viable, compromise available to come to closure on this issue. 
Mr. President, these frozen assets were blocked to prevent Iraq from using the funds to support its aggression against Kuwait and its allies. That freeze--designed to hurt Iraq--is now hurting American companies. Some of those firms were a mere electronic transfer, a keystroke on a computer, away from receiving their payments when the emergency freeze was imposed. After 7 years, it is time to act expeditiously in their favor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to mention another group of Americans who are suffering as Members of Congress continue to hold up the disaster relief supplemental appropriations bill and prevent us from passing a funding measure that the President can sign. That struggling group is our Nation's low-income farmers. 
Back in April of this year, a group of farmers came to my office and described to me a crisis as real as the floods faced by Americans in the Upper Midwest. It is planting season and many States, including Virginia, have exhausted their total allocation of direct operating loans. Direct operating loans are the funds made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to cover the costs of planting and repaid when crops are harvested. Without operating funds, the livelihoods of many farmers, mostly on small farms, are threatened. 
The Operating Loan Program is especially important for minority farmers, many of whom have suffered from the well-documented discrimination within the Department of Agriculture. Discrimination has caused or contributed to the financial ruin of minority farmers nationwide and has resulted in bankruptcies and impoverished retirements. But as the number of black farmers in the United States has dwindled at three times the rate of other farmers nationwide--nearly to the point of extinction--a few farmers have managed to survive and keep their struggling farms afloat. USDA acknowledges that `having direct operating loan funds is critical for low-income minority farmers in their effort to become self-sustaining, successful, contributing members of rural communities.' 
After speaking with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and with the assistance of Senators Cochran, Bumpers, Stevens and Byrd, we were able to include an appropriation in the supplemental to provide $100 million in direct operating loan funds to those low-income farmers who cannot obtain credit elsewhere. I believe these funds are as critical to serving the needs of small and limited-resource farmers as implementing the recommendations outlined in the Civil Rights Action Team report to remedy many of the long-standing problems plaguing the Department and eradicating, once and for all, the discrimination that has plagued the Department for decades. 
Unfortunately for Virginia and the other Southern States, it is now June, and we have reached the tail end of the planting season. As we waste time disputing controversial provisions attached to a disaster relief funding bill, we've denied farmers access to loan assistance and prevented the farmers who have survived decades of discrimination the money needed to get their crops in the ground and to keep their farms afloat. 
Mr. President, I find this situation frustrating, but my frustration must pale in comparison to the low-income and minority farmers who have struggled and, thus far, have managed to survive this manmade disaster. Again I want to thank my colleagues who are interested in helping our Nation's farmers and helped add my language to the supplemental. But, I ask my colleagues who are keeping this desperately needed money out of the field and out of the hands of our Nation's farmers to stop playing politics and let us pass a bill that the President is willing to sign.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Tinner Hill Heritage Foundation. This Saturday, just across the Potomac River in Falls Church, VA, a street festival will celebrate the birth of the modern civil rights movement in Virginia. 
In the late 1800's, Charles and Mary Tinner bought the top of a hill in Falls Church and it has been known as Tinner Hill ever since. Currently, the seventh generation of Tinners now live on the hill that bears the family name. While the longevity of the Tinner family in and of itself is impressive, what transpired in June 1915 is what will be celebrated this weekend. That year, the Falls Church Town Council adopted an ordinance to segregate the residences of the town. This would mean that many families of African ancestry would have to give up the homes they owned. Dr. E.B. Henderson, a resident of Tinner Hill, organized the Colored Citizens Protective League and filed a suit to prevent enforcement of the ordinance. Dr. Henderson then called a meeting to form the first rural branch of the NAACP in the Nation. Joseph Tinner, son of Charles, became its first president. As a result, the town council reversed the ordinance. Over the next 50 years, the Hendersons, Tinners, and others organized civil rights activities that set a precedent and a model for the rural South. 
Today, the Tinners and the Hendersons share the hill with a diverse mix of businesses that represent many cultural backgrounds. We all owe a great debt to the brave former inhabitants of Tinner Hill who risked there lives and livelihoods to defend the Bill of Rights and to start a movement that has had far reaching consequences.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, earlier today I supported and the Senate passed a budget resolution negotiated primarily by the leadership of the legislative and executive branches of our Government. 
I supported this budget resolution, notwithstanding some major disappointments with both the process and the result. 
I qualify my support for the final agreement because I believe it falls well short of the goals that we should have for a responsible fiscal policy to guide our Nation over the next 5 years and beyond. 
But in the end, I recognize that this is probably the best product the congressional leadership and this administration could agree on, and that we're much better off doing something than doing nothing. 
And reaching this general consensus will free the Congress to get on with many of the important matters that continuing gridlock would have postponed. 
The commitment to reach a balanced budget early in the next century can trace its roots to the hard work done by the President in 1993 and the insistence last Congress, by the new congressional majority, that we set 2002 as a `date certain' to actually reach balance. 
And I think its fair to add that I doubt this agreement would have been possible without the bipartisan groundwork laid by the Centrist Coalition, a group of 22 Senators evenly divided between both sides of the aisle. 
Our budget was the only balanced budget plan introduced last year which received bipartisan support. 
Since passing the administration's deficit reduction package in 1993, we have brought the deficit down from $290 billion to what most forecasters expect will be a $67 billion deficit this year. 
With the aid of lower deficits, low interest rates, and low inflation, the economy continues to expand, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent and filling the Federal Treasury with unexpected receipts. 
These fundamentals, which I believe were set in motion with the passage of the 1993 plan, have now put a balanced budget within our grasp, even if we're relying on some optimistic assumptions about revenues on future Congresses making tougher decisions than we are making in this budget, and on the Social Security surplus to reach that future balance. 
This is not an insignificant event. The last time the Federal Government submitted a balanced budget was in 1968--for fiscal year 1969--and the surplus that year was only $3.2 billion. 
As one who came to the Senate in January 1989 pledging to do all I could to eliminate persistent budget deficits, the prospect of actually reaching our goal, even 5 years down the road, is certainly a welcome milestone. 
As I have already noted, however, this agreement is not all I had hoped it would be. 
First, I'm very concerned about the assumptions which underlie the plan. 
Less than 3 weeks ago, negotiators were putting the finishing touches on this same basic budget outline, with a deficit of approximately $50 billion in 2002. 
It was only after the Congressional Budget Office revised its revenue forecasts that negotiations were able to claim a balanced budget. 
To fully understand the impact of the CBO revision, the deficit projections for the next 5 years are now a total of $250 billion less than what CBO projected in January. 
If we want to increase the likelihood that we will actually achieve balance, it seems to me that we would want to use the most conservative economic forecast that we have. 
If we err in our projections, I would rather err on the side of doing more deficit reduction than less than what is needed to do the job. 
But even if the more optimistic assumptions come true and we do balance the unified budget in 2002, this plan does little to address the long-term fiscal challenges we face, and in some ways may exacerbate them. 
While the budget calls for some modest steps to restrain the growth of entitlement spending, in the areas of Medicare and Medicaid, these modest steps do not prevent entitlement spending from taking a larger share of the budget. 
Mandatory spending in the form of entitlements and interest on the debt will consume over 70 percent of the budget by 2002. 
This represents a complete reversal from 30 years ago when 70 percent of the budget went for defense and other discretionary investments. 
And as mandatory spending takes up a greater share of the budget, that leaves less room for investments in human and physical capital that enhance future productivity and economic growth. 
Not only does this budget not call for significant entitlement reform, the inclusion of tax cuts with large out-year costs also exacerbates our long-term fiscal problems. 
As all of us know, we face a demographic wave, called the baby boom generation, that will double the number of people eligible for Social Security, and Medicare, between now and 2030. 
By not addressing the long-term costs of Medicare and Social Security, and by failing to adopt an accurate measure of cost-of-living changes, entitlements will continue to grow at an unsustainable pace. That is at the same time, the tax cuts in this budget plan will take away the revenue needed to finance these expenditures. 
The most likely result of this scenario is the continued cutbacks on defense and other discretionary priorities in the future or even larger budget deficits than what we have faced in the past. 
As a result, I view this budget as more of a missed opportunity to address our long-term fiscal challenges rather than the budget balancing achievement that many are celebrating. 
Notwithstanding my reservations about this agreement, however, and my disappointment in some of its elements, I applaud the President and the congressional leadership for their efforts to end the gridlock and reach a compromise that both sides could live with, even though the deal closers were more spending to satisfy Democrats and more tax cuts to satisfy Republicans--tax cuts I might add that are made with borrowed money. Less of each would have eased the debt burden we are passing on to future generations, and I will work with my colleagues to make it a more fiscally responsible plan along the way. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from the Senator from Nebraska which expresses the Sense of the Senate that adjustments in Federal benefit programs should be considered by the Senate. I commend my colleague from Nebraska for his work on this important effort. 
Mr. President, this amendment recognizes the fact that we face an explosion in entitlement spending over the near horizon, not just because we promised too much to too many, but principally due to simple demographics. Our people are living longer and the great baby boomer generation is getting closer to retirement. 
In l940, the average woman in America who retired at age 65 received social security benefits for l3.4 years. By l995, women--and men--were living much longer. And the average woman retiring in l995 will receive l9.l years of Social Security--or nearly 6 more years of benefits--because the retirement age still remains at 65. 
In l950, seven workers supported each social security beneficiary, Mr. President. By l990 there were just five workers per beneficiary. And by the year 2030, there will be fewer than three workers per beneficiary. 
We all know the statistics. By the year 20l2, if no changes are made, entitlements and interest on the debt will consume every single dollar the Federal Government takes in. This stifles our ability to invest in our Nation and protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. 
And it doesn't have to be, Mr. President. Small steps today can save billions tomorrow. Billions of dollars of debt we will not leave to our children--the baby bust generation, as Pete Peterson calls those who will inherit our debt. 
Mr. President, this amendment proposes that we work to enact structural reforms which will successfully restrain the growth of mandatory expenditures. In my view, the Senate should consider such reforms as using the most accurate measure of cost-of-living available, extending the civil service retirement age for future Government workers, extending the military retirement age for future enlistees, gradually tracking Medicare eligibility with Social Security eligibility, and extending the retirement age for Social Security. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Otherwise, the day will surely come when we will have to explain to our children why, when we could have made a difference, we failed to enact entitlement reform. 
These kinds of choices are never easy politically--but they just get tougher as the problem becomes more acute. Now is the time to act if we are going to act responsibly. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will take a minute to commend my two colleagues from Nebraska for introducing this particular resolution today. I was pleased to join with them a few weeks ago over at the Vietnam Memorial. 
It was my privilege 15 years ago to participate in both the groundbreaking and the dedication. I have had many visits to that memorial since. I think it is very clear that it has served a purpose even beyond the expectations of those who created it and those who were initially involved in the dedication ceremonies. It has a healing effect for all of those who visit, regardless of what their personal feelings may have been about the conflict itself. They recognize that we come together to honor those warriors who gave the last full measure to their country, and the notes that are left behind are the kind of communication that I would defy anyone to read without feeling some of the emotion that is involved in it. 
I commend both Senator Hagel and Senator Kerrey for this particular resolution this morning, and I commend it to all of our colleagues as an appropriate remembrance of those friends and those who wore our uniform in terms of service to our country in the conflict in Vietnam. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank Senators Cochran and Bumpers, chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senators Stevens and Byrd, chairman and ranking member of the full committee, for their help in making loans available to low-income farmers and averting a potential man-made disaster. 
This is planting season. Many farmers in the Commonwealth, and around the Nation, need to borrow funds to cover the costs of planting, which are repayed when crops are harvested. In the past, these funds have been made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its direct operating loan program. Unfortunately, this program is out of funds for the year, and the very livelihoods of many farmers, mostly on small farms, are threatened. 
Mr. President, when I was told of this situation by a number of farmers who came to my office 2 weeks ago, I contacted Agriculture Secretary Glickman and Senator Bumpers. It was clear to me that the crisis these farmers faced was as real as the floods faced by our fellow Americans in the upper Midwest. With their help, we were able to include in this bill an appropriation that will provide $100 million in direct operating loan funds to our Nation's low-income farmers. Getting this money out into the fields is an emergency. In passing this provision, we will be `filling the sandbags' that can protect our farmers from a disaster, this one of manmade origins. 
Let me just add that this provision is especially important to minority farmers, who have suffered in the past from well-documented discrimination within the Department of Agriculture. I know Secretary Glickman is committed to eradicating the discrimination, but I'm not sure he will be able to succeed on his own. These loans are crucial to these farmers. To quote a memo from the Department of Agriculture, `many of the low-income farmers which we will not be able to provide operating loan [OL] funds to--if no further money were appropriated--are minorities. Having adequate direct OL loan funds is critical for low-income minority farmers in their effort to become self-sustaining, successful, contributing members of rural communities.' 
Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their help in this matter, and I urge my colleagues to move this legislation quickly, to alleviate both the pain of natural disasters past and the possiblity of this manmade disaster in the near future.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Children's Health Insurance Provides Security [CHIPS] Act because I support expanding access to health care for children who lack coverage today, and because I believe this bill is both flexible and targeted to children in families least likely to have employer-based coverage and least able to purchase health insurance on their own. 
It is my hope that States will find the enhanced Federal Medicaid match included in this bill to be a valuable tool to assist many vulnerable families, particularly families moving from welfare to work. Far too many welfare recipients will, at least initially, move from dependency into hourly jobs with little pay and few, if any, benefits. Children should not lose their health care because their parents work.

Mr. ROBB. I thank my friend and colleague from Delaware. 
Mr. President, there's not much left to say about ratification of the CWC--even here in the Senate. We've had seventeen formal hearings on the topic over the last two years--both open and closed--and as a member of all three national security committees, I have participated in most of them. In addition, the salient features have been discussed in countless meetings and fora that have that have been widely reported in both print and broadcast media. Finally, for everyone involved, the moment of truth has arrived and we will cast what will certainly be one of the most important votes of the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I have been committed to ratification for some time, but I know some of our colleagues have had reservations. There is no question that respected opponents of ratification have raised important and legitimate questions. But those questions have been thoroughly and painstakingly answered by the proponents, including and I believe that our failure to ratify this chemical weapons convention today would represent a serious setback for the United States and the entire international community and unquestionably would be viewed as a failure of leadership by the world's indispensable nation. 
I will not repeat all of the arguments that have been made. In his news conference earlier today the majority leader framed the essential question. And he repeated it here on the Senate floor earlier this afternoon. And I certainly commend him for the way he responded. He asked will we be better off with or without the treaty--for me that is not a close call. 
I believe we will be much better off, by any measure I can think of, if we ratify the convention. 
I hope that the 28 conditions that we agreed to yesterday, and the additional reassurances provided by the President today, will insure that at least two-thirds of our colleagues reach the same conclusion. 
The United States is getting out of the chemical weapons business with or without an international agreement--and because over 70 other nations have already ratified the convention, it goes into effect on April 29th, regardless of what we do. The only matter we'll decide tonight is whether we'll be able to participate and shape banning the use, development, production, and stockpiling of chemical agents, or be cast with the pariah states that will face increasing difficulty due to permanent trade restrictions on non-CWC members. 
If we want to play a leading role in at least reducing the likelihood that poison gas will be used against us or the rest of the international community, we have no choice but to ratify this convention. 
Of course, there are no absolutes when it comes to arms control verification, but through the most far-reaching, extensive, and intrusive inspection procedures ever agreed to, the CWC represents a clear step in the right direction. 
I do not question the patriotism of any of our colleagues who oppose ratification, but I belive we owe a special debt of gratitude to those statesmen who might find some partisan or ideological advantage in opposing ratification, but who put our country's interest first in supporting it. 
In that regard, I'd like to single out our former colleague and Majority Leader, Bob Dole, who now joins the Presidents of both parties who negotiated, signed, and submitted the convention for ratification, as well as a distinguished galaxy of present and past top-level national security leaders. 
And, I would like to conclude by commending Senator Biden, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Lugar, a longstanding expert in the area of arms control, for their leadership and tenacity these last few weeks. Due to their tireless efforts, I hope we will have the votes to ratify the CWC and signal to the world our continuing leadership, by example, to eliminate these weapons of mass destruction from the face of the earth. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the professional dedication, vision and public service of Dr. Anita K. Jones who is completing her appointment, after 4 years, as the Director of Defense Research and Engineering [DDR&E]. A native of Texas, and longtime Virginia resident, Dr. Jones is one of this country's preeminent information technology experts and a pioneer for women in science and engineering career fields everywhere. Prior to coming to the Department of Defense, she was the chair of the department of computer science at the University of Virginia. As DDR&E, she serves in one of the Nation's top technical positions and oversees the largest defense research and development organization in the world. 
Her strong support for, and oversight of, the multibillion-dollar Defense Science and Technology [S&T] Program dramatically improved the warfighting capabilities and readiness of our Nation's military forces both today and well into the future. Dr. Jones spearheaded the implementation of a new structured planning process which aligns technology research and development more directly with critical warfighting and national security priorities. Through strong leadership, she brought the technology and operational military communities together to design detailed plans to sustain U.S. dominance on the battlefield into the next century. 
In addition, Dr. Jones focused the Department of Defense S&T Program to ensure military and national preeminence in several strategic technologies with both military and commercial application such as information technology, high-performance computing, advanced electronics, materials and modeling and simulation. Her active outreach within the Department of Defense expanded greatly the scope of the Defense S&T Program and the speed and ease at which technology is developed and transitioned into our warfighting arsenal and support infrastructure. Furthermore, her direct support of pervasive technologies such as high end computing and semiconductors resulted in breakthroughs across a wide spectrum of applications, both military and civilian, such as modeling of geophysical phenomenon, aerodynamics and process flow, which contributed directly to our Nation's ability to execute a record number of peacekeeping and military operations without the loss of a single life due to combat. 
Dr. Jones' awards include the Department of Defense Award for Distinguished Public Service and the Meritorious Civilian Service Award. She has served on several Government advisory boards and scientific review panels such as the Defense Science Board, Air Force Scientific Advisory Board, the National Research Council, and the National Science Foundation. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineers and is a fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
I know that Dr. Jones' husband, William A. Wulf, and her daughters, Karin and Ellen, are proud of her many accomplishments, and so is the Nation. Her distinguished service will be genuinely missed in the Department of Defense, and all of us who know her wish her every success as she returns to the University of Virginia.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we debate our tax system and the management of the Internal Revenue Service, I believe we should take time out to recognize a largely unappreciated group of public servants. If there is anyone dreading tax day more than the taxpayer in general, it is the front line IRS employee who is right now trying to handle all of those last minute phone calls and process the bulk of returns that are just now starting to flood in. These people are not the problem, they are the ones who make the system as it exists work in the best way possible. The revenues they collect pay for our national parks, our highways, and our national defense. While we can debate the system at length, I believe we should take a moment today of all days to recognize the hard work done by those front line men and women at the IRS to make our government run.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in order to commend and acknowledge Ms. Joan K. Stevens, who is retiring from the White House Military Office after more than 25 years of dedicated service to her country. Ms. Stevens has loyally assisted six Presidents as a liaison to the military and has had the kind of impact on peoples' lives that demands respect and compels our sincerest appreciation. She has facilitated over 500,000 military inquiries from the public and it is because of individuals such as Ms. Stevens that a healthy communication endures between the Commander in Chief and our troops out in the field. 
Ms. Stevens first began working in the Special Counsel's Office of the White House in July of 1972 . She later spent time in the First Lady's Office in February of 1973. In November of 1974, however, Ms. Stevens found her calling and the WHMO, in turn, discovered an invaluable and faithful staffer. She has been there ever since, working diligently to perpetuate the idea that the men and women of our Armed Forces are indeed important and have a discernible voice in our government that must be heard. 
Also noteworthy is the fact that Ms. Stevens has, for more than two decades, been the single point of contact for the thousands of Presidential condolence letters to the next-of-kin of active duty personnel who have tragically died in military related accidents. Paying tribute to America's fallen warriors is an obligation that begins with the leadership of this country. It is hard to imagine the responsibility and burden Ms. Stevens' has ultimately shouldered on behalf of a grateful nation. 
In recognition of her efforts and devotion, Ms. Stevens was recently awarded the Secretary of Defense Public Service Medal. It is clear Ms. Joan Stevens will be missed dearly. Still, as a fellow Virginian, the State Ms. Stevens has called home for over 26 years, I am truly honored to have the opportunity today to congratulate her on a remarkable career and salute her commitment to the President, the Armed Forces of the United States, and most importantly, to the American people. Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues both here and in the White House, and the family and friends of Ms. Joan K. Stevens, in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to this exemplary public servant.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, leadership often involves seizing the moment. And right now the moment is a realbut rapidly fleeting chance to actually balance the Federal budget. For those of us who have long been dedicated to stopping the Federal Government from spending more than it takes in, the moment is now. While we're away from Washington during the recess, I hope that we will use this time to prepare ourselves for serious work on the budget when we return. We cannot let another opportunity to do what's right pass us by. 
I recognize the fear on both sides. The President is understandably reluctant to embrace a necessary change in the Consumer Price Index because of its effect, however minimal, on benefits for a large and vocal segment of the population. The Republican Party is reluctant to scale back its calls for a massive tax cut because of a similar effect on an equally vocal segment of their supporters. 
But simple math dictates that both must occur if we are truly interested in balancing the budget and keeping it in balance over the long term. And the reality is that entitlements have got to be curbed, and the resulting savings have got to go to reducing the deficit, not tax cuts. 
The Speaker of the House has taken a bold step by expressing a willingness to surrender tax cuts until the budget is balanced. I hope the President will meet this bold step by expressing his willingness to reconsider an adjustment in the CPI, or some other means to accomplish the same goal. 
As meetings take place over the course of the congressional recess, I would encourage both sides to use as a starting point the Centrist Coalition budget developed last year by a bipartisan group of Senators, including myself. 
The Centrist plan, known also as the Chafee-Breaux plan, was the only budget in the Senate last year that received bipartisan support. In fact, the Centrist plan received 46 votes. And to me, that seems like a logical place to start. 
Our plan used conservative economic assumptions, a rational reduction in the Consumer Price Index, and a modest tax cut. We did not have, within our coalition, universal agreement on all aspects of the plan. Personally, I have always wanted to postpone even modest tax cuts until we actually achieve balance. But, I believe it provides a reasonable roadmap now of how to get from here to a budget that balances. I hope that this plan will help guide congressional and White House negotiators during their upcoming budget talks. 
With that, Mr. President, I hope all of our colleagues come back fully reenvigorated and ready to start producing some results. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation which will protect communities from being inundated with unwanted garbage generated out-of-State. The essential thrust of the legislation is to empower localities to protect themselves from unwanted trash by allowing them to decide whether landfills or incinerators located within their communities should be permitted to accept out-of-State waste. It also seeks to strike the appropriate balance between State and local authority. 
Those of us who formerly served in State government are keenly aware of the divisions of labor among the various levels of government. Due to Supreme Court decisions regarding the U.S. Constitution's commerce clause, disposing of trash implicates all three levels of government. 
Under the commerce clause, only Congress is permitted to regulate interstate commerce. Because the Supreme Court has determined that garbage is commerce like any other commodity, States and localities have been powerless to halt the disposal of waste disposed in their jurisdictions which was generated outside the State. Thus the Federal Government must determine how best to regulate this article of commerce. 
The role of the States in regulating the disposal of garbage centers on its responsibility to protect the State's environment. Based on environmental criteria, the States determine whether to issue permits for the construction of landfills, and are charged with monitoring the operation of landfills and incinerators to guarantee compliance with environmental laws. My bill will not affect in any way the State's right to enforce the States environmental standards. 
The real responsibility for disposing of trash, however, has rested historically with local governments. It is their responsibility to pick up the trash and to find a place to put it down. Because this is the locality's ultimate responsibility, and because the local community is the one most directly affected by garbage imports, my bill delegates primary authority regarding interstate waste to the local governments. 
The legislation defines an affected local government as the political subdivision of the State charged with making land use decisions. In my view, if an elected body is competent to make decisions regarding the use of land in the community, then it is certainly competent to determine whether a landfill, already permitted under State law, should be allowed to accept out-of-State waste. 
Striking the right balance between State and local authority was only half the battle. The other major issue implicated by placing restrictions on out-of-State waste is how to treat existing facilities. In many cases, existing facilities which accept out-of-State waste do so in the face of local opposition. These communities understandably want us to stop the garbage from flowing. It would not be fair, however, to those who expended millions of dollars to build new landfills in compliance with strict federal regulations to cut off their commerce completely. Therefore, my measure balances these interests by allowing the Governor of each State to limit the amount of out-of-State waste which can be disposed of in an existing facility. 
To finance new waste disposal facilities that meet stringent State and Federal environmental regulations, some local governments are cooperating with private developers to build these state-of-the-art facilities. This cooperative relationship, however, can only florish if the locality has some leverage over the developer. Under present law, a local government is powerless to deny a zoning permit to a landfill developer simply because waste from out-of-State will be disposed in the landfill. If the local government is given the power to reject out-of-State waste, it also will have the power to accept the waste, with conditions. By allowing communities to have leverage at the bargaining table, they can enter into host community agreements which are beneficial to the locality and its neighbors. 
In many instances, this can be a winning proposition for the local community. The new landfill can be built at no cost to the community, and the community can charge a host community fee which can be used to reduce taxes or pay for other projects, such as building schools. 
While inviting a landfill developer into a community may not be the solution for every local government, it should remain an option for those who choose to pursue it. And under my legislation, the local government would not have to make such a decision alone. The legislation requires the local government to consult with the Governor and adjoining local governments before a decision is made. 
More importantly, however, my legislation absolutely bans out-of-State waste from new facilities unless a community affirmatively agrees to the imports. This is important to many communities in my State, mostly rural, that can fall prey under existing law to unscrupulous landfill developers who, in their search for land, can run roughshod over the wishes of the locality. I hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this legislation and protecting our communities from unwanted out-of-State trash.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I submit a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that all Federal annuitants should receive their cost-of-living adjustments at the same time. 
This resolution is very similar to one submitted by my colleague from Maryland, and cosponsored by the other distinguished Senator from Maryland and my own esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Virginia. And while I agree with them in spirit, I could not support the wording of their resolution so I am here to offer my own. 
As we are all aware by now, the President's budget proposal would delay Federal retiree cost-of-living adjustments from their statutory date of January 1 to April 1 until the year 2002. This same budget proposal, however, would leave the effective date for COLA's for other Federal COLA recipients at January 1, thus singling out Federal civilian retirees as the only Federal beneficiaries with their COLA's delayed. This seems blatantly unfair and violates the principle of COLA equity that so many of us have espoused over the years. If the budget justification is there to delay one group, then why isn't it there for the others? Conversely, if there is a policy justification for not delaying certain retirees, then why are Federal retirees any different? 
I could not join my colleagues in cosponsoring their resolution because I can see a point where a policy decision to treat everyone equitably could result in delaying COLA's across all of these programs. That is not what I believe we need to do this year, and I'll continue to support efforts to equalize COLA's in January. I could not, however, in good conscience cosponsor a resolution which I might contradict at a later point in time. 
As an alternative, I am offering a concurrent resolution which expresses the sense of the Congress that COLA's for all of these Federal annuitants and beneficiaries should be paid at the same time. The resolution deliberately does not state a date certain, simply that the principle of equity between them should prevail.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to extend the legislative authority for the Board of Regents of Gunston Hall to establish a memorial to honor a distinguished Virginian, George Mason. 
In 1776, George Mason wrote the Virginia Declaration of Rights, the first document in America calling for freedom of the press, freedom of religion, proscription of unreasonable searches, and the right to a speedy trial. The Virginia Declaration of Rights not only served as a model for our national Bill of Rights; but historians believe that Mason's refusal to sign the Constitution for its failure, initially, to include a declaration of rights was a major impetus for eventual adoption of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. 
George Mason sacrificed friendships by insisting that a strong national government could not be purchased at the cost of individual rights, and Mason inevitably chose his family over politics. He retired from public office following the Constitutional Convention and died just a few years later in 1792. His contemporaries, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, lived decades longer and were elected Presidents of the United States, and thus Mason's contributions were soon overshadowed. 
Efforts were combined during the 101st Congress to at last honor America's `Forgotten Founder.' Legislation authorizing a private, nonprofit organization to establish a memorial to George Mason on Federal land in the District of Columbia passed and was signed by then-President George Bush. In the 102d Congress, a resolution concurred that George Mason was an individual `of preeminent historical significance to the nation,' and authorized the placement of the memorial within select area I lands, in sight of the memorials of two of Mason's closest friends: George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The legislation was signed into law on April 28, 1992, and approved by the National Capital Memorial Committee in December 1993. 
To pay homage to a man whose ideas played a prominent role in the founding of the American Republic, a fitting memorial has been designed for this supreme site, located between Ohio Drive and the 14th Street Bridge, overlooking the Tidal Basin. The memorial designs have been completed and submitted for review to all necessary advisory and review boards and by agreement, the United States Park Service is to maintain the memorial once completed. In accordance with the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, $1 million must be raised in non-Federal funds to construct this gift to Washington and all Americans and ground-breaking is ordered to occur no later than August 1997. The Board of Regents of Gunston Hall Plantation, a historical organization that oversees Mason's family home in Fairfax County, is dedicated to raising the necessary funds for the monument and seeing this important project through to its completion, however, the August 1997 deadline is rapidly approaching. At this time, it seems that the fundraising effort will not be completed and that's why today I introduce the necessary legislation granting an extension until August 2000. 
The Commemorative Works Act, passed into law to prevent overcrowding on the Mall, requires two separate acts of Congress before a memorial may be placed in area I lands, and both of these hurdles have been cleared. The final battle is a fundraising one and the Board of Regents of Gunston Hall has a plan of attack. Last year, they launched Liberty 2000, a campaign to share George Mason's legacy of liberty. The Board of Regents hope to build an endowment fund to ensure a secure future for Gunston Hall and attain the necessary non-Federal funds to break ground and complete their efforts to bring George Mason's legacy to the Mall. I ask that you join me in swiftly supporting this 3-year extension so we may properly commemorate this great statesman and Virginian, George Mason.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I must confess that I am not particularly comfortable as a proponent of adding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and I never have been. 
Many of those with whom I am frequently aligned on issues that don't enjoy much popular political support yet represent sound public policy are very much opposed to this amendment--and cannot understand why I am supporting it. 
But I am not persuaded by the impassioned arguments against it, and, regrettably, that leaves me at odds with the President, the leadership of my party, most editorial writers, and virtually all of the progressive organizations with which I often find common cause. 
It was out of frustration that I first came to support the amendment well over a decade ago during the time the Federal Government began to run huge annual deficits year after year, with no evidence of the discipline necessary to rein them in and I have been a reluctant backer ever since. 
As most of our colleagues know, however, I've always been far more committed to a balanced budget than to a balanced budget amendment and I would not be supporting an amendment now, if I held out any hope that we would actually reach that goal without it. 
In truth, actually achieving a balanced budget will be extremely difficult and there is no guarantee that we'll reach it, with or without the amendment, because we will have to make some politically painful decisions to get there--either way. 
And that is really the point. 
Why fear the amendment if it will only put more pressure on us to make the same tough decisions we're going to have to make anyway if we're serious about balancing the budget. 
We owe it to the American people, and to future generations in particular to be a whole lot more candid about the choices we face, and the decisions we are going to have to make. 
We cannot keep promising that we will not touch Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid or veteran's pensions or any other entitlement program, because we are going to have to make some adjustments to all of these programs, or we will put them all at risk. 
I am particularly concerned about arguments that suggest we threaten Social Security if we pass a balanced budget amendment. That is just not true. 
The greatest risk for Social Security is not taking the need to balance the budget seriously. 
The real threat to our security, to our Social Security, to our economic security, and to our national security is the national debt. 
Each year we pay more interest, on more debt, and that leaves fewer dollars to spend on everything else we look to Government to provide. 
And if we don't make some changes soon, in just 15 years every cent the Government takes in will be required just to pay for entitlement programs and interest on the national debt--every cent. 
Now that is really something to worry about. 
The other argument heard so often is that the balanced budget amendment, will not permit us to respond to national emergencies. 
That is nonsense. 
To be sure it is designed to increase the pressure on us to make the politically difficult choices we keep avoiding. 
But for any real emergency we can override it with 60 votes, as we have in the past. 
Just look at how many votes we get on our routine emergency supplemental appropriations bills. 
In times of true national emergencies, we will have virtually unanimous support to waive the limitation and in the interim, we will have an added incentive, to be more fiscally responsible. 
Mr. President, notwithstanding good intentions and despite the rhetoric to the contrary, I just do not believe either the executive branch of the Federal Government or the legislative branch of the Federal Government have the collective will to make the really tough but necessary decisions without the added pressure the balanced budget amendment will help guarantee. 
So, the die may well be cast. It may be it will fall one vote short. But I hope all of those who profess to support a balanced budget, whether with or without an amendment, will keep those commitments in mind as we approach the very difficult choices that we inevitably face if we are ever to get to that particular goal. 
Mr. President, I yield any time I have remaining, and I thank the Chair. 
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce the Combat Veterans Medical Equity Act of 1997, legislation which will serve to codify America's obligation to provide for the medical needs of our combat-wounded veterans. 
Although we have long recognized the combat-wounded vet to be among our most deserving veterans, and although we have long distinguished the sacrifices of these veterans by awarding the Purple Heart Medal, remarkably, there is nothing in current law that stipulates an entitlement to health care based upon this physical sacrifice. In fact, I believe most Americans would be surprised to learn that a combat-wounded Purple Heart recipient could be denied services for which a noncombat veteran, with a non-service-connected disability, would be eligible. This legislation would seek to remedy that situation. 
Specifically, this bill establishes eligibility for VA hospital care and medical services based upon the award of the Purple Heart Medal. It also gives Purple Heart recipients an enrollment priority on par with former prisoners of war and veterans with service-connected disabilities rated between 10 and 20 percent. 
Mr. President, as a Vietnam veteran who has been privileged to lead marines in combat, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices made by all of our men and women in uniform. At the same time, in the face of tighter budgets and greater competition for services, I believe strongly that Congress should ensure equity in the disbursing of medical services for our most deserving of veterans--the combat wounded. These veterans, who have shed their blood to keep our country safe and free, deserve no less.

 Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to right an obvious wrong. As I was reading the Washington Post on January 6, 1997, I ran across a brief mention that employees of the CIA who are assigned to protect the Director of Central Intelligence must pay their own way when they are forced to buy meals because of their assigned protection duties. 
Evidently these Federal employees are required to keep a line of sight on the Director 24 hours a day, which sometimes entails following him to restaurants. These restaurants in turn refuse to let the protection detail occupy a table without purchasing a meal. While this may sound trivial, I do not believe it is fair to require a Federal employee to buy an expensive meal as part of their job. I am sure you'll agree that if a person is going to spend that kind of money on a meal, they should be enjoying it with a good friend or loved one, not watching their boss across the room. 
For that reason, I am introducing this bill, which would authorize any Federal agency to pay the meal expenses for cases like this one for an employee who is serving on a 24-hour-a-day security detail which requires the employee to remain in the line of sight of the person being protected. I understand that certain agencies already have this authority, but it clearly should be extended to all Federal agencies. I hope that this noncontroversial measure can be examined by the appropriate committee and quickly passed. The existing situation is blatantly unfair and needs to be changed.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, in my 8 years of service in the Senate, and in particular during my time on the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee, I have had the privilege and honor of working with Bill Cohen. His expertise and thoughtfulness, as well as his ability to put the national interests above partisan politics, have made him an invaluable asset to this body. Whether regarding arms controls, missile defense, or acquisition reform, Bill Cohen's independence and reasoned approach have resulted in passage of major pieces of legislation on highly complex and politicized matters. Those same qualities will enable our next Secretary of Defense to guide the Nation through an uncertain future, and to make the many difficult choices we face in reconciling protection of our vital interests overseas with ever-increasing demands on our Federal budget here at home. 
Bill Perry has proven himself as one of the most capable Defense Secretaries ever, and Bill Cohen will have a remarkable legacy to follow. But I am confident he shares the same kind of dispassionate, in-depth analytic qualities and measured, even-keeled leadership qualities that will keep America safe well into the 21st century. I wish him much success in his new position, and with that, Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I will submit for the Record a statement relating to the nomination and confirmation of both now Secretary Madeleine Albright and now Secretary Bill Cohen. I was unable to get to the floor during those particular periods when their virtues were being extolled at some length. I have enormous respect for them individually, as all of our colleagues do. 
I salute the leadership on both sides of the aisle for moving these nominations through expeditiously. I believe they are both committed to a strong national defense and assertive foreign policy. I think they will work well together as a team and with the President. I think their respective quick confirmations are good for the country. I commend all of those who helped to make that possible, including my distinguished senior Senator from Virginia and the distinguished majority leader, as well as the minority leader, for what they have done.

Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the distinguished choice of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. Ambassador Albright has served the country with distinction over a 20-year period. She brings the requisite skills, knowledge, and experience to one of the most demanding jobs in Government, and I am confident that she will help President Clinton continue our leadership of the community of nations. 
During her confirmation hearing, Ambassador Albright conveyed to me a strong sense of how the United States must act and lead in addressing problems around the world where our interests and values are at stake. She demonstrated a keen understanding of how diplomacy and force work together to advance our foreign policy goals. 
Ambassador Albright stated to the committee that `force, and the credible possibility of its use, are essential to defend our vital interests and to keep America safe. But force alone can be a blunt instrument, and there are many problems it cannot solve. To be effective, force and diplomacy must complement and reinforce each other.' 
I believe we need to tangibly demonstrate our commitment to peace and stability, in both manpower and structure, as we forge a new security order in Europe and serve as a balancing wheel in Asia. American leadership abroad will depend on the President and his national security team having the spine to lead our allies against inimical forces, including rogue nations, terrorist elements, and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
In that regard, President Clinton has chosen well in Madeleine Albright. She has a direct, no nonsense style that suits these times well, and will invigorate our foreign policy agenda. I look forward to joining hands with her as the administration continues its efforts to promote freedom, peace, and security abroad.
