Mr. ENZI. The people of Wyoming have always had very strong ties to our land. That is why the words `Livestock, Oil, Grain and Mines' appear on our state seal. Those words clearly reflect the importance of our natural resources to the people of my state, and our commitment to using our abundant natural resources wisely and for the benefit of current and future generations of Wyomingites and the people of this country. 
Congress has determined the need to find newer and cleaner technologies. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of clean burning coal reserves. It would seem to be a perfect match. We are eager to provide what is needed for our country's present and future fuel needs. But those reserves aren't likely to be developed unless we provide the incentives necessary to make it possible for the coal to be harvested in a safe and environmentally friendly manner.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have been talking about the budget and the way that the President of the United States wants to spend Social Security--the surplus. I want to talk to you about that in another line--the way that the White House wants to raise your taxes, and the way they are going to do it in November in a very subtle way. I am going to talk to you about jobs--your jobs--and the effort that is underway by the White House to shift your job overseas. The White House has been denying that. I know that the Energy Information Administration confirms it, and how we will not only shift your job overseas, but we are going to charge more for everything that you buy. 
Let me explain how this works. The new Energy Information Administration estimate is very important for a couple of reasons. It proves that the White House is using funny numbers on global warming. In my opinion, it also points out that we are spending a lot of time debating the details of a treaty that is fundamentally flawed. I have always said that something not worth doing at all is not worth doing well. The administration has already bought the global warming treaty, and now we are trying to figure out how to pay for it. We are trying to figure out how to make it work. It is as if we decided to sink the mother ship and now we need to figure out the cheapest way to rescue all of the people. 
Mr. President, it is easy. Don't sink the ship. Sink the treaty. It is like saying that the Titanic is going down and we need to reorganize how the deck chairs are placed. 
I came to the floor in July and raised serious doubts about the numbers that were dreamt up by the Council of Economic Advisers. The council chairman, Janet Yellen, has testified twice that Kyoto would cost American families somewhere between $70 and $110 per year. I don't know how you feel about it, but the people in Wyoming think that $70-odd to $110 per year more for Government taxes is a lot. But I want to point out that the independent economists put those costs as high as $2,100 per year per household. That is a pretty good, hefty tax. And it is a $2,000 difference from what the administration is saying that it will amount to. 
I have tried to get the real numbers on this before. I have been stonewalled by the White House. Then I finally got some numbers that were rather unintelligible. I asked questions about them. I got a letter from the White House Counsel's Office that said that public disclosure of the real terms would set an unfortunate precedent that could chill the free flow of internal discussions essential to effective executive decisionmaking. 
In other words, the White House can't really share the numbers with us because we, the Congress, would have a chilling effect on policy-making? That is our realm. We need to have the data on which to operate. And the White House is the one in charge of providing that data. 
We have a credibility gap. We have a credibility gap with the administration. 
I think it is interesting to compare the cost estimates from the White House with the cost estimates from the independent Energy Information Administration, part of the administration. The White House says the annual average increase in household energy would be $70 to $110. 
I have a little chart. This shows a few of the studies that have been done on global warming. The red line is the administration. You will notice that all of them that have been done are on the very bottom level. This is the one that says it is only going to cost you $70 to $110 a year. The blue line is the Energy Information Administration, part of the administration. This blue line, you will notice, appears at the top of the list. That is what they say it is going to cost you --$335 to $1,740 per year per family. 
The White House says gasoline would only go up to $1.31 a gallon. The Energy Information Administration says $1.91 a gallon. 
How about fuel oil? That is something our friends in the Northeast worry about. The White House says, `Don't worry, it will only go up to about $1.17 a gallon.' The Energy Information Administration says it will go up to $1.90 a gallon. Who do you want to believe? The administration's low numbers or the administration's high numbers? You are the one paying the bill; which one would you trust? 
I wanted you to know what kind of assumptions the Council of Economic Advisers used. How did they get things to look so rosy? It turns out they brought the cost down using two tricks. Their own internal report said they had to figure out some way to bring down the cost or it would not be feasible. They already bought the treaty, now they have to figure out why they bought the treaty. They want the American people to think they got a good deal for you. 
The two tricks they use are electricity deregulation and emissions trading. That is how they make it seem to cost less, even though I thought we wanted to deregulate electricity to save the people back home money. What we are going to do is deregulate it and use that money to pay for the global warming treaty. I guess now we need to go back and tell them that the money is already spent if we deregulate, and it has to be deregulated because we have to spend the money. That seems to happen a lot around here. 
Then the emissions trading scheme, that one takes the cake. Each of the cost estimates I have seen include a range of credit trading scenarios. The assumption is the more credits we can buy, the cheaper it will be to meet our Kyoto commitments. That is the assumption: The more we buy, the cheaper it gets. That is like going to the mall and saving money by taking advantage of as many sales as you can. You still spend the money. 
The Energy Information Administration says the credits will cost us $70 to $350 a term. In people terms, that is 15 cents to 70 cents a gallon of gas, up to an 80 percent increase in your electrical bill. And we thought deregulation would save us some money. 
The range is as a result of not knowing how many countries will participate. If we have to buy all our credits only from Europe and Russia, they are going to be very expensive. That puts us in the $350-per-ton range. If we get countries like China and India to sell us their emission credits, we can get that cost down to $70. That is the assumption. 
Do you know why they will sell us theirs for so low a price? They don't have any ceiling. Last year I went to Kyoto. I got to meet with the Chinese delegation. By the year 2012 they are going to be the biggest polluters in the whole world and they will not be a part of the treaty. Why not? They are a developing nation. They cannot be put under those constraints. I asked them when they would be done being a developing nation. They said, `Never.' Good negotiating. They even developed a fine system so that if we pollute, we get fined, and the money goes to, guess who, the developing nations. They get the money that way. 
Now there is another scheme--sell credits. We buy the right to pollute from China and the developing nations. They will sell it to us for just $70 a ton because they have no limit. They are not really selling a quantity. They can sell as many units as they want. They are already polluting; they can continue to pollute. Good deal for us? That is what the White House says we can do. We will pay China so we can have the right to drive our cars and turn on our lights. We will pay China so we can drive when we want to and where we want to. Just pay China and you can turn on all your Christmas lights whenever you want. They will already have the jobs. 
In theory, China will limit its own emissions at some future level. In the meantime, they will sell us permits, in theory. In theory the whole world would participate and we would reduce the growth of carbon emissions and save the Earth from certain devastation--in theory. 
I got to meet with those nations that are island nations; if global warming happens, they will be inundated by water. They are not going to be a part of the treaty. If this were a real problem and your country was going to be inundated by water, wouldn't you sign the treaty? Wouldn't you push every nation in the world to sign the treaty? I can tell you, they are not, which tells you what they think about global warming. 
It is a way to get jobs. It is a way to sell emission credits. The whole world is not participating and the Earth will not be saved because the treaty will not reduce carbon emissions. In fact, we cannot even get the developing world to abide by copyright treaties, what makes anybody think they will abide by an emissions treaty even if they sign it? Oh, no, the joke will be on us. It will be on the American people. We are planning to pay China for a piece of paper that says, `We reduced our emissions by 1 ton so you can increase yours by 1 ton.' And we will pay them for that right. That is what it says. 
What are we going to do if they just take the money and keep on polluting? And they have assured us they would. Are we going to send in troops and demand our money back? The Energy Information Administration has pointed out that this treaty would cost American families between $350 and $1,740 per year. That is what the private economists have been saying. And it will eliminate jobs. 
I urge my colleagues to get a copy of this report and read it. In November the administration will go to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to continue negotiations on the Kyoto treaty. They plan to work out emissions trading enforcement provisions. These are two critical parts of how this treaty will hurt American families. People need to be mindful of this process. People need to protest this process. Now is the time, not during the negotiations, not after the President has signed and sent a treaty here that we have already said, 95 to 0, does not meet the requirements for the economy in the United States, that it is just selling our economy. 
A study conducted by DRI-McGraw-Hill estimated Kyoto could cost us 1.5 million jobs. Charles River Associates put that figure as high as 3.1 million jobs by 2010. 
Even the Argonne National Laboratory, pointed to job losses in a study on the impact of higher energy prices on energy-intensive industries. Argonne concluded that 200,000 American chemical workers could lose their jobs. All of the American aluminum plants could close, putting another 20,000 workers out of work. Cement companies would move another 6,000 jobs overseas. And nearly 100,000 U.S. steel workers would be out of work. 
Americans have a right to know what is going on, even if the Office of White House Counsel does not think so. They should have a chance to see who is playing with their livelihoods. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I can think of few issues that are more important to the average American than the safety and health of our Nation's workers. During the last 2 years, Congress stepped up to the plate and confronted this important issue head-on. The end result was three separate bills becoming law that amended the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Until this year, in 28 years, the act was amended one time--in 1990--and that was to increase fines. The American workplace has changed quite a bit over the last three decades and I'm pleased that Congress in now changing, too. 
During the first session of the 105th Congress, I introduced a comprehensive piece of legislation with the support of Senator Gregg and Frist and 20 other Senate cosponsors, entitled the Safety Advancement for Employees Act or SAFE Act. At the same time, my good friend, Jim Talent, introduced similar legislation in the House which received strong, bipartisan support--a rarity for such a polarized issue. 
It is important to understand that both the Senate and House versions did not attempt to reinvent OSHA's wheel, just change its tires. Treading water for 27 years, OSHA has never seriously attempted to encourage employers and employees in their efforts to create safe and healthful workplaces. Instead, OSHA chose to operate according to a command and control mentality. This approach has lead to burdensome and often incomprehensible regulations which do not relate to worker safety and health and are, quite often, only sporadically enforced. 
The AFL-CIO publically acknowledges that with only 2,450 State and Federal inspectors regulating 6.2 million American worksites, an employer can expect to see an inspector once every 167 years. In addition to this enormous time lapse, the sheer diversity of safety and health concerns stemming from restaurants to funeral homes across America prohibits an inspector from fully understanding each worker's needs and concerns. 
OSHA seems more concerned about collecting fines each year than it is about improving worker safety. OSHA proposes over $140 million in fines to be paid by the regulated public each year--over $100 million of that total gets assessed. Even more troubling is that OSHA's existing voluntary and cooperative compliance programs impact a mere fraction of worksites and consume only a small share of the agency's annual budget. Despite OSHA's claim that it is `putting a lot of resources into compliance assistance and partnership initiatives,' only 22 percent of OSHA's 1997 fiscal appropriation was spent on federal and state plan compliance assistance. It is difficult for anyone to say that current initiatives are having an impact on the number of workplace fatalities and injuries when OSHA spends so little of its annual funds on preventive measures. 
It is important to point out that the SAFE Act would not have dismantled OSHA's enforcement capabilities. It was that approach that 
kept Congress from amending the 1970 statute for so long. Enforcement alone, though, will never ensure the safety of our nation's workplaces and the health of our working population. By encouraging employers to seek individualized compliance assistance from OSHA qualified third party consultants, the SAFE Act would ensure that more American workplaces are in compliance with existing law while allowing OSHA to concentrate its enforcement resources on those worksites that truly need immediate attention. America would be better served by an OSHA that manages its resources more wisely and the SAFE Act was crafted to strike that balance. 
In addition to establishing OSHA qualified third party consultations, the SAFE Act included additional voluntary and technical compliance initiatives to assist employers in deeming their worksites `safe' for their employees. I firmly believe that it is this approach that will ultimately bring a greater number of workplaces into compliance with existing law and help prevent more workers from being injured or killed on the job. 
The SAFE Act would ensure that federal occupational safety and health standards are based on sound, scientific data that all vested parties can live with. By injecting independent scientific peer review into the rule-making process, future regulations would reflect greater clarity and simplicity--helping businesses to better understand what they are required to do. I also believe that scientific peer review will help speed up the implementation process for OSHA's rules by eliminating conflicts of interest. Under the present system, draft rules can idle in the process for more than 15 years, because no one agrees on the rule's scientific validity. At the same time, annual funding continues to be channeled toward research at the expense of the taxpayer. That must change. 
Last October, we marked up the SAFE Act in the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and favorably reported the bill out of committee. In the following months, I continued to work with Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Wellstone, and Reed--as well as with Assistant Secretary of Labor, Charles Jeffress, to find common ground that would result in a bill that would pass the House and Senate and be signed by the President into law. A number of good suggestions were made to improve the bill, but remaining differences and the lack of floor time quickly became an insurmountable obstacle. 
I was pleased to have the opportunity to testify at a hearing chaired by Chairman Talent in the House Small Business Committee. As the House author of the SAFE Act, Representative Talent understood the importance of third party consultations. He invited specialists in occupational safety and health to share their candid opinions of the bill. Having witnessed the testimony firsthand, I was pleased that safety and health professionals--those who have the most education, training, and field experience in abating occupational hazards--embraced this bill so enthusiastically. 
In both Chambers, the SAFE Act gained considerable momentum 
after its introduction. The bill stuck to a theme--advancing safety and health in the workplace. Maintaining this spirit of cooperation, it is my intention to promote this theme well into the 106th Congress. Until each of the SAFE Act's provisions become law, this debate is far from over. 
Despite the Senate's inability to complete its consideration of the SAFE Act, legislative successes were still abundant. Last June, I was pleased to have had the opportunity to pass two bills in the Senate that were authored by Representative Ballenger. One was the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Compliance Assistance Authorization Act, and the other was H.R. 2877, which eliminated the imposition of quotas in the context of OSHA's enforcement activities. Both bills are now law and have already been implemented by OSHA. 
Following the same lines as the SAFE Act, these two bills were written to increase the joint cooperation of employees, employers, and OSHA in the effort to ensure safe and healthful working conditions. It will never be productive to threaten employers with fines for non-compliance when millions of safety conscious employers don't know how they are supposed to comply. Nor is it effective to burden employers with more compliance materials than they can possibly digest or understand, many of which have no application to their business. To achieve a new, cooperative approach, the vast majority of employers who are concerned about worker safety and health must have compliance assistance programs made more accessible to them and more related to their actual operation. Passage of H.R. 2864 was a good, first step in providing employers just that. 
H.R. 2877 eliminated enforcement quotas for OSHA compliance inspectors. This bill prohibits OSHA from establishing a specific number of citations issued, or the amount of penalties collected. I believe that inspectors must not face institutional pressure to issue citations or collect fines, but rather they should work to identify potential hazards and assist the employer in abating them. OSHA's success must depend upon whether the nation's workforce is safer and healthier, and not upon meeting or surpassing goals for inspections, citations, or penalties. 
In July, both the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and full Senate unanimously passed S. 2112, the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act. The bill was written to bring the Postal Service and its more than 800,000 employees under the full jurisdiction of OSHA. Government must play by its own rules. Although all federal agencies must comply with the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health statute, they are not required to pay penalties issued to them by OSHA. The lack of any enforcement tool renders compliance requirements for the public sector ineffective at best. 
My first look at this issue occurred when Yellowstone National Park was cited by OSHA last February for 600 violations--92 of them serious. One of those serious violations was the park's failure to report an employee's death to OSHA. In fact, Yellowstone posted five 
employee deaths in the past three and one-half years. Although there are these and other serious problems noted in the park's safety and health record, overall federal injury, illness, lost work-time, fatality and workers's compensation rates show the United States Postal Service leading the pack in almost every category. 
Postal workers injuries and illnesses represent 42 percent of the government's lost-time cases. From 1992 to 1997, the Postal Service paid an annual average of $505 million in workers' compensation costs and its annual contribution accounted for almost on-third of the federal program's $1.8 billion price tag. These alarming statistics made my decision to slowly bring the federal government into compliance rather easy. 
In 1982, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient--depending entirely on market-driven revenues rather than taxpayer dollars. They should be congratulated for that. Today, the United States Postal Service handles over 43 percent of the world's mail--delivering more mail in one week than Federal Express and the United Parcel Service combined deliver in an entire year. With annual profits that exceed $1.5 billion, if the Postal Service were a private company, it would be the 9th largest business in the United States and 29th in the entire world. 
Realistically speaking, the Postal Service is hardly a federal agency. It's better characterized as a self-sufficient, quasi-government entity. It is the only federal agency where its employees can collectively bargain under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. It's the only federal agency that posts annual profits exceeding $1.5 billion. In fact, the Postal Service exhibits almost every characteristic of a private business, yet it never had to fully comply with federal occupational safety and health law--until now. Last month, Representative Greenwood, author of the House bill, took the initiative to pass the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act in the House and sent it on to the President. 
Since the bill's enactment, I learned that OSHA and the National Park Service, have entered into safety pact. I commend both agencies for this commitment to workplace safety and health. It is my understanding that other federal agencies could do the same. I hope that such agreements with OSHA represent a way to introduce third party consultations as a means of bringing a greater number of federal worksites into compliance. 
The enactment of S. 2112 and the previous two bills marks the first significant step toward modernizing the nation's 28 year-old occupational safety and health law. I believe that these incremental accomplishment were achieved because this Congress is committed to improving conditions for America's workers. We have a long road ahead of us and that road, so far, had been too slow to save American lives. This debate will not end when Congress completes its work this year. I fully intent to press forward--well into the 106th Congress. More hearings on this important issue are necessary. We need a 
bipartisan effort--making headway in every area we can reach agreement. We need to dedicate some time to reaching that agreement. This will not happen by accident! Good legislation will ultimately be achieved and increased compliance will undoubtedly result if we simply remain committed to it. 
I want to conclude my remarks by thanking members and staff for making occupational safety and health such a successful issue during the last two years. I want to first thank my House colleague and friend Jim Talent. His impressive knowledge of labor law, complemented by his labor counsel, Jennifer Woodbury, helped bring the SAFE Act to the attention of all House members. I look forward to work on many more bills with Jim Talent in the coming years. I would also like to thank Congressmen Ballenger, Greenwood, and McHugh and their staff. They, too, should be complimented for their efforts. Senators Gregg, Frist, and Jeffords also deserve tremendous thanks. Their staffs spent many hours considering OSHA legislation. Finally, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee. Senator Kennedy was especially considerate in listening to my concerns and I want to extend my appreciation to him and his staff. I am confident that this relationship will pick up next year where it left off.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take a minute before the Senate adjourns to thank a few Members who have been very helpful on an issue of critical importance to my state. 
Yesterday evening, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent, S. 2500, a bill to preserve the sanctity of existing leases and contracts for production of methane gas from coal beds. An affirmative U.S. Government policy has been the legal basis for these contracts for nearly eighteen years and it was the intent of this bill to preserve the existing rights of all the parties in light of legal uncertainties cast by a July 20, 1998, 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision. 
On September 18, I introduced the bill to protect these people, with my colleagues, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming. The affected people live all across America, but most of the actual lands are in the western states, primarily New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana. 
The circumstances faced by interest owners would be severe. Personal and corporate bankruptcies would have led to local bank insolvencies and the multiplying effect on unemployment and loss of confidence in western states would have been devastating. In this time when Congress is working to offer a $4-7 billion aid package to provide certainty for crop farmers, I am pleased that we have been able to reach agreement to provide some certainty for people in the oil patch--and we did it without spending a single federal dime. 
The 1998 Circuit Court decision has clouded all existing lease and royalty agreements for production of gas out of coal where the ownership of the oil and gas estate differs from ownership of the coal estate. This uncertainty jeopardizes the expected income of all royalty owners and the planned investment and development of all existing lessees. 
The legislation we passed yesterday addresses that problem faced by owners and lessees by preserving the policy status quo for valid contracts in effect on or before the date of enactment. The legislation applies only to leases and contracts for `coalbed methane' production out of federally-owned coal. It does not apply to leases and contracts for gas production out of coal that has been conveyed, restored, or transferred to a third party, including to a federally recognized Indian tribe. 
It is important to note that many older leases and contracts for gas production on coal lands were negotiated prior to `coalbed methane' becoming a term of art. It is, therefore, necessary to clarify that we do not mean to exclude those valid leases and contracts that convey rights to explore for, extract and sell `natural gas' from applicable lands simply because they do not include the term `coalbed methane.' That is a possible ambiguity that arose very late in the process, after the time when we could have reasonably perfected the bill, but it is important to note because before this year, `coalbed methane' has been considered in the field, to be part of the gas estate. We chose the term `coalbed methane' because using the term `natural gas from the coalbed,' left uncertainty about the gas rights in light of the 10th Circuit ruling. The Department of Interior suggested we use `coalbed methane' so as to be very clear regardless of whether the Courts rule `coalbed methane' to be part of the coal estate or part of the natural gas estate in the future. 
While the bill has yet to be completed in the House, I want to thank some of the members who have helped us craft legislation that addresses what we intended to cover. Without any of them, we would not have been able to go forward. Because of very limited time, we had to expedite the process, and we could not have done it without an enormous amount of help. Senator Campbell, and his Indian Affairs Committee staff, were supportive in working out the provisions covering the tribes. Senator Murkowski, and his Energy Committee staff, were very helpful in working out the details of the bill and moving it through that Committee. Senator Bumpers, and his com- 
mittee staff, were very cooperative and provided many helpful suggestions. 
The Department of Interior Solicitor's office provided good counsel and worked with us through the process. And the people out in the field, the coal companies, who have valid concerns about their existing and future leases to main federal coal, were great to work with. Nothing in this bill should be construed to limit their ability to mine federal coal under valid leases, nor should anything be construed to expand their liabilities to coalbed methane owners covered by the bill. The gas producers and land owners really came together and proposed reasonable solutions to solve the problems. Without their cooperative effort, this bill would not have happened. 
So again, my appreciation goes out to all the people who helped us remove the possibility of devastating situation--extensive private property takings, retroactive liabilities, and mountains of combative litigation. On behalf of thousands of Wyomingites, thank you. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of S. 2330, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. As an original cosponsor, I'm confident that this legislation is the logical step to ensure Americans accessible and affordable healthcare. 
On January 13, 1998, the Majority Leader created the Republican Health Care Task Force to begin pouring the foundation for a comprehensive piece of legislation that would enhance the quality of care without dismantling access and affordability. For the last seven months, the task force met every Thursday--and other times as needed--with scores of stakeholders prior to writing this bill. Such thorough steps in writing a bill have clearly paid off. We now have legislation that would provide patients' rights and quality healthcare without nationalized, bureaucratized, budget-busting, one-size-fits-all mandates. 
In 1993, President and Mrs. Clinton launched an aggressive campaign to nationalize the delivery of healthcare under the guise of modest reform. The sales pitch was backed with scores of anecdotes illustrated from Presidential podiums across the country. The stories pulled on the heartstrings of all Americans and were intentionally aimed at injecting fear and paranoia into all persons covered or not covered by private health insurance. 
I am quick to ask my constituents interested in the President's bill to carefully examine the fine print. It's no surprise to me that most of them already have. The American people haven't forgotten the last time this Administration tried to slip nationalized healthcare past their noses. Folks in this town may be surprised to learn that the American people aren't a bunch of pinheads. Anyone can put lipstick on a pig, give it a fancy Hollywood title, and hope for an election-year slam dunk. Expecting the public to close its eyes and kiss that pig, however, is an entirely different matter. 
The American people understand what's going on here. They know full well that higher premiums mean no coverage. Why? Because affordable access to healthcare is an even higher priority than quality. If it isn't affordable, it doesn't exist! By issuing one-size-fits-all mandates and setting the stage for endless litigation, the President's bill could dramatically raise the price of premiums--barring people from purchasing insurance. The President would be well advised to call his legislation the `Patient's Bill,' because a costly bill is exactly what Americans would receive. That's the bottom line for American families--the cost. We all want quality. There isn't a member in Congress who doesn't want quality. But if Americans are expected to pay up to 23 percent higher premiums to get it, they'll most often have to go without insurance. It's that simple. 
I remember the reaction Wyoming residents had to the 1993 `Clinton Care' plan. I was a State Senator living in Gillette, Wyoming at the time. I recall how the President and First Lady rode a bus across America--promoting nationalized healthcare. I also remember the detour they took when they arrived at the Wyoming border. Instead of entering my home state, they chose a more populated route through Colorado. That was an unfortunate choice. They missed an important healthcare point. Had they driven all 400 miles across southern Wyoming, they would have seen for themselves why one-size-fits-all legislation doesn't work in rural, under-served states. 
Affordable and accessible care is THE life-line for Wyoming residents. I live in a city of 22,000 people. It's 145 miles to another town of equal or greater size. Many of my constituents have to drive up to 125 miles one-way just to receive basic care. More importantly, though, is the difficulty we face enticing doctors and practitioners to live and practice medicine in Wyoming. I'm very proud of Wyoming's health care professionals. They practice with their hearts, not their wallets. 
In a rural, under-served state like Wyoming, only three managed care plans are available and that covers just six counties. Once again, this is partly due to my state's small population. Managed care plans generally profit from high enrollment, and as a result, the majority of plans in Wyoming are traditional indemnity plans--commonly known as fee-for-service. Some folks might wonder why I am so concerned about the President's healthcare package, especially since it's geared toward managed care. I'm concerned because a number of Wyoming insurers offer managed care plans elsewhere. Any premium hike spurred by mandates in the Presidents' bill could be distributed across the board--causing increases in the fee-for-service premiums in Wyoming. Simply put, my constituents could easily end up paying for services they'll never get! 40 percent of my constituents are self-insured--meaning they pay for their own health insurance out of their own pockets. Expecting my constituents to pay more poses a clear and potential threat to exclude them from health insurance coverage. The urban areas get the care--we get the cost. Added cost--that's it--that's all. 
The Republican plan is the right choice for America. It would safeguard 48 million people out of the 124 million now covered by the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA by requiring that group healthcare plans provide enrollees with: access to emergency medical care; point-of-service coverage; access to ob-gyn care; access to pediatric care; continuity of care; and, a ban on patient/doctor `gag' rules. ERISA plans, whether fully-insured or self-insured, would also be required to provide enrollees with information about plans and providers such as options, restrictions and descriptions. 
The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights would also allow a patient to hold their health plan accountable. The President's bill, however, would allow a patient to sue their own health plan and tie up state courts with litigation for months or years. The only people that benefit from this would be trial lawyers. The patient, however, would be lucky to get a decision about their plan before their ailment advanced or even took their life. A big settlement doesn't do much good if you got it, because you died while the trial lawyers fiddled with the facts. Folks aren't interested in suing their health plan. They watch enough court-TV shows to know how expensive that process is and how long it takes to get a decision made. This isn't L.A. Law--it's reality. The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights avoids all this by incorporating an internal appeals process that doesn't exceed 72 hours. If not satisfied, an enrollee would be able to access an external review by independent medical experts. Getting quick decisions saves lives. 
The President has repeatedly said that the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights should apply to all health insurance plans. Such claims are no different than those made by the President back in 1993. He wants nationalized healthcare--plain and simple. There is a reason the Republican bill only amends ERISA. It's because the 124 million ERISA enrollees are not regulated by the states. The states, by the way, have been in the business of regulating the health insurance industry far longer than Congress or any President was beating up on managed care. 
The President wants all regulatory decisions about a person's health insurance plan to be made from Washington--nationalized care. The reason this won't work is that it fails to take into account the unique type of healthcare provided in states like Wyoming. While serving in the Wyoming Legislature for 10 years, I gained tremendous respect for our state insurance commissioner's ability to administer quality guidelines and insurance regulations that cater to our state. State regulation and understanding is absolutely, unequivocally essential. I firmly believe that decisions which impact my constituents' health insurance should continue to be made in Cheyenne--not Washington. 
Congress has an obligation to ensure such quality services to the 124 million ERISA enrollees whose plans are currently absent these protections. In doing so, however, the Republican bill stays within its jurisdictional boundaries and doesn't trample over states' rights. As a result, Americans can gain protections whether they are insured under a state, ERISA, or Medicare regulated plan. I believe that this approach is rational and fair. 
The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights would provide individual rights with respect to a person's own, personal health information. Access to personal medical records is a delicate matter. Provisions, however, are included to address inspection and copying of a person's medical information. Safeguards and enforcement language has also been added to guarantee confidentiality. In relation to this language, group health plans and health insurance issuers in both the group and individual market would be prohibited from collecting or using predictive genetic information about a patient with the intention of denying health insurance coverage or setting premium rates. 
The Republican plan would establish the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research. This is not a new federal agency, but rather a new name for the current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research within the Department of Health and Human Services. This agency would be modernized to improve healthcare quality throughout America. The agency would not mandate a national definition of quality, but it would provide information to patients regarding the quality of care people receive, allow physicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers, and enable employers and individuals to make prudent purchases based on quality. 
The Senate Labor Committee held a number of hearings in relation to women's health research and prevention. As a result, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights includes a number of important provisions that represent women's health. These provisions will clearly benefit the promotion of basic and clinical research for osteoporosis, breast and ovarian cancer, the effects of aging and other women's health issues. 
Finally, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights broadens access to coverage by removing the 750,000 cap on medical savings accounts (MSA's). MSA's are a success and should be made available to anyone who wishes to control their own healthcare costs. Moreover, persons who pay for their own health insurance could deduct 100 percent of the costs if the Republican plan is enacted. This would have a dramatic impact on folks from Wyoming. These provisions would, without a doubt, pave the way for quality healthcare to millions of Americans without dismantling access and affordability. 
While the President's bill has been pitched as being essential to enhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my colleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any nationalized, bureaucratized, budget-busting, one-size-fits-all bill would have on our nation's healthcare system. As I have encouraged my constituents to read the fine print, I ask my colleagues to consider how the President's legislation impacts you and your home state. Rural states deserve a voice, too. Only the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Act would give them that voice.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bill, as modified, before us. I cosponsored S. 1868, the `International Religious Freedom Act', sponsored by the honorable Senator from Oklahoma because I have become concerned with the trends or continued policies of religious discrimination and persecution in certain countries. I applaud his efforts to work with all interested parties in forming a consensus bill with 29 cosponsors--one that even prior opponents can support. He has been persistent in his efforts to form a bill that addresses the legitimate concerns of most of the bill's previous detractors, including the Administration. I must also commend the senior Senator from Pennsylvania for focusing Congress' attention on this important issue. 
I feel it is extremely important, as a nation that firmly believes in the freedom of an individual to practice his or her religious belief, that our foreign policy reflect and promote this basic right of individuals. The manner in which we deal with other nations should include, but not be exclusive to, the way these nations honor the religious liberty of their citizens and visitors. I believe this bill as amended, strikes a responsible balance between the national security or economic interests, and the importance America places in the freedom of religious thought and practice for all throughout the world. The goal of promoting religious liberty in other countries is entirely consistent with the United States' policies of promoting human rights and democracy throughout the world. 
Many Europeans first settled this continent for the very reason of gaining freedom of religious thought and practice. We can look to William Penn as just one example of an individual in American history that strove to promote the rights of individuals to practice their religion without interference. His goal was to create a land of religious toleration--that land was called Pennsylvania. He even drew up Pennsylvania's colonial Constitution, which included in its first article the protection of the freedom to worship according to one's own conscience. To this day, America continues to be a beacon to the world, guaranteeing the freedom to worship as one desires. 
As a nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles, it especially saddens me when I learn about the increase in the persecution of Christian individuals worldwide. However, it is not just Christians in certain parts of the world that are being punished simply because of their beliefs--it is also those who practice Islam, Judaism, and just about every other religion or belief. Our Founding Fathers made it clear in the Declaration of Independence that the basic Laws of Nature and of Nature's God are entitled to all individuals. This guiding document, a unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America, says that: 
. . . all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. 
The ability to practice ones religious beliefs without undue government interference is a fundamental right--an unalienable right. The American Founders believed in this right so much that they included the freedom to exercise one's religion in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. The basic right to the freedom of thought, conscience and religion has also been declared by many other countries, as evidenced by the member signatories of the Helsinki Accords and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
I believe this legislation will promote ideals that America stands for--specifically the freedom of religion--in the international community. This bill is especially important because religious persecution takes many forms and even seems to be on the rise in some parts of the world. The bill before us will deal with countries that disregard the basic right of individuals to believe as they choose in a manner that is consistent, yet flexible--one that allows the President to choose from a variety of measures to address the injustices of the violating country. It allows a flexible response from the Administration, which recognizes that religious persecution takes many different forms, with varying degrees of severity. The bill's flexibility also recognizes the importance of a foreign policy that can be both pro-active and reactive to our national security and economic interests. The one action in dealing with violators of religious freedom that would not be allowed by this bill would be that of inaction or silence. If we, as defenders of freedom, are silent in matters so fundamental to our political belief system as religious liberty, then we are no better than the perpetrators of this unjust persecution and discrimination. This bill would help create a consistent U.S. foreign policy with respect to how we deal with countries that do not respect individuals' freedom of thought and conscience. I urge my colleagues to join with me and the 28 other cosponsors to vote in favor of this bill.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my friend from Arkansas. This amendment addresses the issue that is being changed by the Senator from New Hampshire. The second-degree amendment would change things back to the way that they were. 
We have to take a look at the Internet sales tax issue for people who might be using this piece of legislation to develop huge loopholes in our current system. I am not talking about changing the system. I am talking about preserving for those cities, towns, counties, and States that rely on sales tax the ability to collect the tax they are currently getting. 
We are talking about a 2-year moratorium. Do you know how much the Internet will change in a 2-year period? Right now, with the current technology in the Internet, there are ways I could eliminate every single bit of retail sales tax in the United States, every day, if this bill passes. And I don't think that is our intent. 
I don't care if we have 30 amendments; if it needs 40 amendments, we will have to have 40 amendments. The number of amendments has nothing to do with the issue that we are addressing. There are some critical issues here that have to be solved to keep the stability of State and local government--just the stability of it--not increase sales tax, just protect what is there right now. 
We introduce these amendments because we don't think there is adequate protection now. An increase in catalog sales, I agree, is a topic for another time. It is very important we don't build electronic loopholes on the Internet, an ever-changing Internet, one that is growing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology virtually every day. What we know as the Internet today is not what we will be using by the time this report comes out. More people are using it every day. 
It is fascinating to me that one of the biggest areas of increased use of the Internet is by senior citizens. It probably has something to do with the quality of entertainment. If they do use computers, they are spending an average of 6 hours a day on the Internet. Part of that is purchasing; part of that is learning. 
The stated purpose of this bill is:  
To establish a national policy against state and local government interference with interstate commerce on the Internet or interactive computer services, and for other purposes. 
Let me repeat that: 
To establish a national policy against State and local government interference. . . . 
Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional responsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I understand the desire of the bill's sponsors to protect and promote the growth of Internet commerce. Internet commerce is an exciting field. It has a lot of growth potential. The new business will create millions of new jobs in the coming years. 
The exciting thing about that for Wyomingites is that our merchants don't have to go where the people are. For people in my State, that means their products are no longer confined to a local market. They don't have to rely on expensive catalogs to sell merchandise to the big city folks. They don't have to travel all the way to Asia to display their goods. The customer can come to us on the Internet. It is a remarkable development, and it will push more growth for small manufacturers in rural America, especially in my State. We are just beginning to see some of the economic potential in the Internet. It is a valuable resource because it provides access on demand. It brings information to your fingertips when you want it and how you want it. 
We should probably take another look at using it on the Senate floor, but we need laptops for that; I will save that issue for another day. 
Having said that, I do have concerns about the bill before the Senate today. I come to this debate having been the mayor of a small town, Gillette, WY, for 8 years. I later served in the State house for 5 years and the State senate for 5 years. Throughout my public life I have always worked to reduce taxes, to return more of people's hard-earned wages to them. 
I am not here to argue in favor of taxes. There were times in Gillette when we had to make tough decisions. I was mayor during the boom time when the size of our town doubled in just a few years. We had to be very creative to be sure that our revenue sources would cover the necessary public services--important services like sewer, water, curb and gutter, filling in potholes, shoveling snow, collecting garbage, mostly water. It is a tough job because the impact of your decision is felt by all of your neighbors. They can look you in the eye. One of the biggest problems with local government is the `Oh, by the ways.' You go to dinner and somebody says, `By the way, I have a little problem. Don't get up and solve it. Tomorrow morning will be fine.' And tomorrow morning they know if you solved that problem. 
Hardly any of those problems is solved without money. When 
you are the mayor of a small town, you are on call 24 hours a day. You are in the phone book. People can call you at night and tell you that the city sewer is backing up into their house. I was fascinated how they were always sure that it was the city's sewer that was doing it. When they call to say that the power is out, they don't want a delay before it is fixed. When they call to tell you a neighbor has stolen a D-8 Cat and is tearing up the street and driving over sports cars and mailboxes and ripping up sprinkler systems, you have to go to work. Those are exciting things that happen from time to time in cities. 
The point is that the government that is closest to the people is also on the shortest time line to get results. I think it is the hardest work. I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that mandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of its citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic loopholes that will take away all of their revenue. It may not seem like a big restriction, it may not exceed the $50 million limit that Congress set in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, but it does establish a national policy against State and local government. It does take an affirmative step to tie the hands of local government. 
Congress has to be very careful when we pass a law like this. We have to realize the effect of all of those people living at the local level--not the Federal level. I have not met anybody who lives on the Federal level; they all live at the local level. 
I am also concerned about the bill's impact on small businesses. My wife Diana and I owned a shoestore on Main Street, Gillette, for 28 years. My wife did most of the managing on that. She greeted the people, she sold the shoes, ran the cash register, swept the floor, all the things that have to be done by a small business. 
We recognize the advantage of the Internet for these small businesses, these home-based businesses that were mentioned earlier. Yes, we understand the complications of trying to keep track of every kind of sales tax that is levied across the whole United States regardless of what kind of jurisdiction it is in. That is current law. That is current collection, to some degree, particularly if you have a presence in the State where the product is being sold. 
What is a `presence' in the State? Internet goes into absolutely every State. There is now the easy capability to set up another corporation in another State that does not have sales tax and still make the sale local, with immediate delivery, and avoid all sales tax through the Internet. That is going to be a problem. 
The problem with small business is, we talk about whether a business is 500 employees or just 150 employees. That is not the kind of small business I am talking about. I am talking about sweeping the sidewalk, carrying out the trash, filling out the myriad reams of required Federal paperwork. It really doesn't have much application to your business--probably five employees or less. These are the people who sponsor Little League, the basketball camps, the yearbooks, and all of the other things that happen in municipalities. They donate the raffle prizes and uniforms and they support all kinds of community activity. Every kid in town comes to the local small business and asks for help. Fortunately for America, they donate, and they donate gladly. They serve on the parade committees. They serve on the fair committees. They are the volunteers in the church and in the school and in local government. They are not only the neighbors, they are the customers for a small town for any retailer. 
We buy mail-order goods often because they are cheaper; there is no sales tax. That is a part of the pitch that is used. That is like a 5- to 7- to 9-percent reduction. 
Congress is now going to decide to prohibit local governments from taxing certain businesses--easy businesses to set up, easy businesses to locate in a State that has no sales tax whatever. We haven't seen anything like this before in the history of the United States, but we are about to see the biggest boom in the Internet that we have ever seen. We need a few amendments to this bill to provide some protection for the current system. I am not talking about expanding, I am talking about the current system. 
Are we going to be in the business of picking the tax winners and the tax losers? I am talking about the towns where the people of America live. We know who the losers will be. It will be the small retailer in your town, the one that you rely on to run down and pick up the emergency item. 
I do support this amendment. The commission should be allowed to study all of the issues with the Internet, all of the issues related to taxation. They definitely ought to be able to look at those that change with the technology so that the current system of collecting revenues for those towns and States can be preserved. I don't think we have all the answers, or we wouldn't be asking for this bill. 
I don't think we are going to have all the answers on the technology that is going to transpire in the next 2 years. So whatever we do, we have to have some amendments that will preserve the way that small business and small towns function at the present time. This amendment will help Congress to make a decision in the future. It restores language that would be taken out with the Gregg amendment. It is critical for towns, small businesses, and you and me. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Agriculture appropriations conference report. I commend Senator Cochran for his hard work in putting together this bill to fund our Nation's agricultural and nutrition programs and to provide emergency assistance to America's farmers in this difficult year. 
I am disappointed, however, that some provisions that would have benefited our Nation's family ranchers who are also suffering from low commodity prices were dropped from the final conference report. Although these measures were unsuccessful this year, I am confident that they will come before the Senate again next year and I intend to work hard for their passage. 
In particular, I am disappointed that the amendment to require the labeling of imported meat was dropped from the final package. I strongly believe that we need to require foreign meat products to be clearly labeled as such. I support free trade, but in order to have free trade you need to have full disclosure. American consumers have a right to know if the meat they are buying has been produced in our Nation. American stockgrowers have a strong record of producing top quality products, and the American consumer should have the ability to identify these top quality products in the grocery store. 
I am also disappointed that the amendment to establish a price reporting pilot project was dropped. Many of my constituents who are family ranchers are very concerned about the current state of the packing industry, notably the increase in packer concentration. I share their concerns. Although I generally do not favor government mandates on any industry, I believe that the price reporting amendment would have provided us with more transparency to determine what effect the recent trend towards consolidation in the packing industry has had on cattle prices. 
In addition, I think we need to add fairness to our meat inspection programs by allowing State-inspected meat to move across State lines. We already allow Canadian and Mexican meat products to be sold in our Nation based on a promise that their standards are the same as ours. There is no reason for our government to trust foreign inspectors and not State inspectors. We need to level the playing field for meat inspections to help out our small packers. Allowing small packers to ship their products across State lines is not only fair, it would also increase competition in the packing industry. Unfortunately this important issue was not considered this year at all. 
So Mr. President, while I will not object to this Agriculture appropriations bill because I recognize how important it is to America's farmers, I am disappointed that it did not do more to address the financial problems facing our Nation's ranching industry. Family ranchers are struggling with the lowest beef prices in over 20 years. Their problems are not now and never have been addressed by huge government spending programs. But Congress should take action to provide free and fair competition in the livestock industry. The three measures I have just outlined would do just that, and I will work hard to make sure that they receive the careful consideration of Congress next year.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we just held a vote to proceed to debating the Internet tax bill. I did not vote to proceed to that bill, and I would like to take a minute to explain why I do not currently support the legislation that is before us. It doesn't have anything to do, as was said before, with whether we are high tech or not. I have been trying to get permission to bring a computer on the floor of the Senate. I work with the Internet. I understand how web sites work. I understand the advantages we could have with more utilization of computers. I understand how the Internet works, and I understand some of the spectacular advantages that we are already enjoying in this country, and some of the ones we could be enjoying to a greater level. I am not trying to keep that from happening. 
There was mention in the motion to proceed that there was very little opposition. That is because it is a motion to proceed. There would be a much stronger opposition if the bill were to be voted on right now, without some of the requests that we have made for amendments--amendments that I think are simple enough that they could have been agreed to as part of a package. 
I want to say right up front that my vote was not a vote in favor of taxes. I want to reduce taxes. I want to stop new taxes--particularly at the Federal level. That is a goal we should all work toward. Federal income taxes, FICA taxes, unemployment taxes, and user taxes are always at the top of the list of burdens on working Americans and small businesses. I want to tell you that this bill doesn't reduce any of those taxes. This bill is an easy way for us to look good. We get to be the tax cutters by placing mandates on the other levels of government. We are tying the hands of local government to be able to finance itself, and we make ourselves out to be the good guys. 
I wish all the Members who voted for cloture today would get as serious about reducing Federal taxes as they seem to be about reducing local taxes. This bill will create an unfair playing field. Congress does have a constitutional responsibility to regulate interstate commerce, and I understand the desire of the bill's sponsors to protect and promote the growth of Internet commerce. But I am concerned that we are picking the tax winners and the tax losers. I want to tell you, the local Main Street retailers will be the losers, unless we have some corrections in this bill. 
There is also nothing in this bill to protect against fraud. The barriers to entry are so low in the Internet commerce and so hard to track that it is difficult to draw comparisons with catalog companies. Catalogs can be tracked. Those orders can be tracked. The Internet is a whole different problem. 
The fraud that can exist in it can go so far as to have a retailer in a town set up an Internet web site in a State that does not have sales taxes. And when you go to purchase in that store, you would purchase through their other corporation in that tax-free State and free yourself from paying any sales tax. That is nice if you do not have to pay sales tax, except most of the States in this Nation rely on some form of sales tax for education money. Some States, including mine, rely on sales tax. There is no income tax in Wyoming. There is no income tax in several other States. There are provisions in the bill for States that do not have income tax to be represented on the commission. I think it is imperative that there be a provision in this Internet bill that those States which do not have an income tax but do have a sales tax also have representation on that committee. 
There should also be a requirement for legislative suggestions from the commission. Right now the commission in this bill is required to give a report. A report on what? I think it ought to be much more specific than that and actually get into the instructions for legislation, the actual wording for the legislation that would ensure an end to the moratorium and be sure that we have something we can actually use. There should be a strong reporting requirement for the commission. 
I look forward to debating this bill in the coming days. I am not opposed to the idea, but I think we have to move closer to the House version of the bill. The House bill does empower the commission to look at the remote sales issue. It does require the commission to produce legislative recommendations. These are important components of the bill that are necessary to keep it fair for small retailers and small governments. 
I come from government that is closest to the people. I was a mayor for 8 years, and I served in the State legislature for 10. In Congress, we make decisions every day that affect the lives of millions of people, but they do not live at the Federal level. They live at the local level. In local government, you make decisions every day that affect the lives of your friends and neighbors, ones who know you and know what you are working on. There is a big difference. 
I am very concerned with any piece of legislation that mandates or restricts local government's ability to meet the needs of citizens, and this bill does exactly that. It may not seem like a big restriction, and it may not exceed the $50 million limit that Congress set in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, but it does establish a national policy against State and local government interference. It takes an affirmative step that ties the hands of local government. 
What am I asking here? I am asking that we actually talk about some of the amendments that we need to have that maintain the status quo for State funding--not increases the tax, not decreases the tax, maintains the status quo. There are States that rely on this tax at the present time, and I will do everything I can to make sure that we do not take away the possibility, or the right, for those States to continue to operate. 
We have to plug the loophole of the possibility for fraud, the possibility for fraud during the 2 years that there is a moratorium. If that gets established and allowed, we will have some of that happening for the rest of the time, and States again relying on the money will not have it. 
That is a brief explanation. I will have an opportunity, I am sure, to expand on those considerably, but we do have concerns. That is why we are trying to make sure that we have an opportunity to have those addressed and to make sure they are addressed up front. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the President and the Senator from Utah. 
I rise today to share my thoughts about another proposed increase in the minimum wage. Having been a small business owner for 27 years, I want to be sure that my concerns regarding the full economic impact that that Federal one-size-fits-all mandate can have on rural States like Wyoming are made known. This complex economic issue demands careful consideration. 
I want to say right up front, I favor an increase for all wages. But that increase should be sparked by a strong free market economy, not by a Federal mandate that would be detrimental to small businesses and to the existence of hundreds of minimum-wage-paying jobs in Wyoming that are already few in number. 
I travel throughout Wyoming almost every weekend. I regularly hold town meetings and attend ice cream socials as a way of listening to my constituents' concerns. I want to point out, Wyoming residents are thick-skinned individuals and they are not shy about sharing opinions--they show up and they share. 
I was not surprised to hear from them that another increase in the minimum wage could close small businesses and eliminate jobs--two things that are already tough to come by in Wyoming. 
As a former shoestore owner, I have always felt that the minimum wage represented a starting wage--better referred to as an entry-level wage. I hear people trying to equate it with a `living wage.' It is a minimum wage. It is an entry-level wage. 
An entry-level wage in Wyoming changes quickly as the individual worker gains experience and improves his or her skills in the workplace. Almost two out of three workers who start at the entry-level wage earn a higher wage within 6 months--more skill, more money. Every job works that way. There are just different entry-level rates--more skill, more money. Kids with no skills have to gain experience in the workplace if they are to understand why hard work is a fundamental step to life's success. 
Moreover, college students seeking part-time jobs to help supplement their education are going to find it even more difficult to obtain work when the number of these available jobs is cut. 
Are the economic realities that impact these kids being considered by this amendment? I will gladly welcome any explanation based on Wyoming's labor market. 
Only 480,000 people live in Wyoming, fewer than any other State in this country. That is not bad; we have plenty of elbowroom. Wyoming still remains a State of high altitude and low multitude dominated by miles and miles of miles and miles. We can still call the wrong number and know who we are talking to. But my State's labor market has produced a set of statistics that worry us. Wyoming ranks 50th in new economic growth, 50th in the creation of new jobs, and 50th in technical industries. That is not a change. We lack the population needed to lure high-turnover jobs. We lack critical mass where there is enough population for businesses to feed on each other. 
While other States are celebrating budget surpluses, Wyoming politicians argue over every available penny, knowing that a $200 million shortfall is expected within the next 5 years. To put that in perspective, a 1 cent statewide sales tax only raised $50 million a year for the State. Having served in the State and the legislature for 10 years, I have dealt with this reality firsthand. 
Folks need to understand why another increase in the minimum wage impacts States like Wyoming differently than Connecticut or Massachusetts. The Nation's economy may be strong, but my State hasn't shared that fortune. It takes a long time for rural States with sparse populations to benefit from these trends. I am not going to buy into the notion that another minimum wage hike is necessary just because the Nation's economy is doing well. There is more to it than that. 
Despite Wyoming's economic portfolio, the absence of intrusive State taxes ensures that family incomes go a long way. It would go even further if I could say the same for Federal taxes--however, we will save that debate for another time. Wyoming residents pay no State income tax, a five-cents-on-the-dollar sales tax, bare-bones `sin' taxes and fuel taxes, and some of the lowest property taxes in the country. In fact, a Wyoming family of four making $50,000 per year pays about $2,500 total in State and local taxes--including sales tax. In Connecticut, that same family of four pays $10,000. That is an incredible difference. Connecticut folks pay four times as much in local and State taxes. Labor Secretary Herman stated in a letter to Chairman Jeffords of the Senate Labor Committee describing how another minimum wage increase would make an `enormous difference in the lives of workers and their families' and that it would `mean an additional $2,000 a year * * *' I guess if I had to pay over $10,000 each year just in State income tax, a Federal minimum wage hike might not sound too bad. However, those folks should be screaming for lower taxes--not higher wages! Those East Coast families have to make up to four times as much to cover State and local taxes. 
Wyoming's low taxes give the dollar plenty of mileage, despite lower wages. Even where the availability of housing is scarce, it's still affordable. My youngest daughter now attends the University of Wyoming in Laramie where rental property is tough to come by. Still, a person can rent a single-family home there for less than $400 per moth. A one-bedroom apartment in a modest Washington neighborhood often exceeds $1,000 per month. That is a monumental difference. Similar to taxes, East Coast workers need to make up to 2 1/2 times as much to cover housing. I made a few phone calls to some local `fast food' restaurants and I learned that each of them started their employees above the minimum wage. I was quoted wages starting from $5.25 per hour at the Burger King in Falls Church to $6.00 per hour at an Alexandria McDonald's. The labor market and cost of living determine these pay rates, not Federal minimum wage laws. But in Wyoming, where these same factors are much different, the wages are dictated entirely from Washington where folks pay 4 times as much for State and local taxes and 2 1/2 times as much for housing. To no surprise, the Burger King in Casper, the McDonald's in Cheyenne, the Taco Bell in Laramie and the McDonald's in Sheridan all start their employees at this entry-level wage. Remember, those who show some interest don't stay at that entry-level wage long. Remember, those who show some interest don't stay at the entry-wage level. Another mandated, one-size-fits-all minimum wage hike may sound like a good deal for Wyoming's entry-level employees, but it isn't Each time the minimum wage is increased, these jobs that put money in the pockets of kids--and sometimes senior citizens, too--become extinct. 
That is not just Wyoming. This chart shows that although the growth and the overall economy did accelerate, it agrees with the other charts. It accelerated in 1996 and 1997. The job growth at eating and drinking places fell sharply after the wage hikes. In 1995, job growth in the whole economy was 2 percent; eating establishments, 3.9. In 1996, after the wage increase goes into effect, the economy grows by 2.8 percent, and the kids working in restaurants only have a growth of 2.2 percent. 
After outpacing overall employment growth each year in the 1990s, job growth at eating and drinking places fell sharply in 1996 and 1997. This chart shows the total employment and the eating and drinking employment. So both of them show the same trends. 
Another chart shows what the new job opportunities at eating places were in 1994 and 1995 versus 1996 and 1997. The rate of growth allowed for 532,800 jobs in 1994 and 1995. Then the minimum wage kicked into effect. The growth was only 281,600 jobs; we lost over 250,000 jobs in that market alone. That is a quarter of a million kids who didn't get a job. 
Despite Wyoming's sparse population, the number of jobs are even fewer. The complaint I hear from my constituents is not about low paying wages, but the lack of jobs. Folks in my State are tired of seeing their kids leave Wyoming to attend college elsewhere simply because there are not enough part-time and full-time entry-level jobs to help them get a little experience and pay for their education while they go to college. Since the bulk of jobs in Wyoming are provided by small businesses, another increase in the minimum wage will only increase that disparity. Another minimum wage increase would hike all wages. I'm in favor of all wages being increased, but not at the cost of critical jobs. If the entry-level wages have to go up, the workers earning slightly more than the minimum wage would have to earn more too. This isn't just a debate about entry-level wages. Not only would small businesses have to pay its employees a higher wage, but the price of products that the business purchases at wholesale costs and sells at retail prices will undoubtedly have to go up--causing customers to purchase less as a result. Lower sales means less jobs. Downsizing would result. If that fails, the business folds--often quickly by Wyoming's standards. This is basic macroeconomics and a simple explanation on why Federal mandates can hurt the very people they are intended to help. 
Unfortunately, people don't work at the Federal level. They work at the local level--even for those who work for the Federal Government. 
Not only have I heard the argument that our economy won't be hurt by another increase since it is already so strong, but the argument is also portrayed to sound as if another increase is long overdue. Over the past 10 years, the Federal Government has walked all over States like Wyoming by subjecting them to national, one-size-fits-all mandates, all kinds. In 1989, the Congress and President Bush negotiated an agreement that provided for three increases in the minimum wage over a 12 month period. By April 1, 1991, the minimum wage rose from $3.35 per hour since 1981 to $4.25 per hour. 
Congress didn't stop there, however. On May 22, 1996, the House passed a tax bill to assist small businesses, entitled the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. On May 23, the very next day, the House passed another bill that increased the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour over two years. These two bills were combined into one package and sent to the Senate where it passed. I was still a small business owner in Wyoming at that time, but I was still appalled by the action Congress and this President took under the guise of `small business protection.' 
That takes us to today. Now the Senate is talking about another increase in the minimum wage--$1 over the next two years. I am a member of the Senate Labor Committee that has jurisdiction over this matter. The committee has not had one, single hearing discussing the impacts of another minimum wage increase. The committee has not considered any legislation that would increase the minimum wage. Rather than discuss the impacts that the pending legislation would have on States like Wyoming, the committee process was shunned. Instead, we're now debating this issue as a matter of election year theatrics. Politics does not constitute sound policy and this attempt to increase the minimum wage again simply confirms that notion. 
I am not interested in playing games with the minimum wage. This is a complex, economic issue that must be carefully considered. If the minimum wage goes up, then so does the poverty level. But wages are already going up because of full employment. A quick downturn in the economy would escalate unemployment. This would be a lose-lose situation. Phony wage hikes drive prices up--so we trick the worker into thinking he or she is getting more--but the bills still can't be paid at the end of the month. Government dabbling in a free economy is phony economics. 
Congress has a duty to weed out political schemes from impacting our Nation's market and labor force. States like Wyoming deserve better than that and I'm not going to sit idly by and allow my constituents' concerns to be silenced.  
This matter should receive a fair hearing and additional consideration by the respective committees and must not be excluded. This is the last-minute election year pitch; nothing more. I strongly oppose this attempt to pass a minimum wage increase, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues, Senator Craig Thomas of Wyoming, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, to introduce a very important bill for our western States and for others that have a lot of federally-owned coal. We have been working with other members, members of the Energy Committee, and with the Department of Interior to put together a good consensus bill. 
On July 20, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a final en banc decision, ruled that methane gas produced out of coal seams is part of the coal itself, and not actually a gas. That means instead of belonging to the owner of the oil and gas, as it has for the past 80 years, it may now belong to the owner of the coal. In Wyoming, the owner of the oil and gas is often different from the owner of the coal--which in most cases is the Federal Government. 
What does that mean? In my home county, the Federal Government owns only about 55% of the oil and gas, but it owns 95% of the coal. That means, in many places where these two resources occur together, there are separate owners. This decision is poised to strip away a majority of the private ownership of gas in Campbell County. It could be an immediate transfer of $250 million over thirty years from private owners to the government--a loss of income and economic activity that will destroy the economy in my home town. 
The effects will be widespread because this decision would overturn a decades-old U.S. Government policy. This Interior policy has acted as the basis for thousands of gas contracts across the west. People have been using since 1981 to govern the development of their contracts and leases. Today, the Circuit Court's decision places all of those contracts in legal limbo. That limbo threatens the livelihood of entire regions in the States like Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico.

Mr. ENZI. I rise to introduce this amendment to the Interior appropriations bill with my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions. 
This amendment has one very important purpose: to ensure that the rights of this Congress and all 50 States are not trampled on by an unelected Cabinet official. 
The amendment is simple and straightforward. It would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from approving any tribal-State gambling agreement which has not first been approved by the tribe and the State in question. It would also prohibit the Secretary from finalizing the rules that were published this past January 22. If these rules are finalized, the Secretary of the Interior would have the ability to bypass all 50 State governments in approving casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. 
Mr. President, this is the third time in 2 years the Senate has had to deal with this issue of Indian gambling. I regret that an amendment is, once again, necessary on this year's Interior appropriations bill. However, until we understand the need for legislative action and effect hearings by the Indian Affairs Committee to resolve differences and reach a reasonable compromise in the Indian gambling process, this amendment is essential. 
Last year, I offered an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill that prohibited Secretary Babbitt from approving any new tribal-State gambling compacts which had not first been approved by the State in accordance with State law. Although that amendment provided for only a 1-year moratorium, the intent of that amendment was clear. Congress does not believe it is appropriate for the Secretary of the Interior to bypass Congress and the States on an issue as important as to whether or not casino gambling would be allowed within State borders. 
Unfortunately, the Secretary did not think Congress was serious when we passed the amendment last year. On January 22 of this year, the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, published proposed regulations which would allow the Secretary of the Interior to bypass the States in the compacting process. In effect, these proposed regulations would allow Secretary Babbitt to approve casino gambling agreements with the Indian tribes without the consent or approval of the States. This action by the Secretary is a very big stick that encourages the tribes enough that they are not interested in any compromise. That is precisely why Congress was willing to place the amendment in last year's appropriations bill. Evidently, Secretary Babbitt did not think Congress was serious. 
We also debated the issue of blocking the Secretary's proposed rules in February, and we had an amendment accepted to the supplemental appropriations bill by a voice vote. When speaking with House conferees who attended the conference to the supplemental, several lobbyists painted our amendment as a Las Vegas protection bill. There are some lobbying groups that are trying that same tactic again this year. I want everyone to be perfectly clear on this point. This amendment is designed primarily for those States that do not allow gambling--particularly those that do not allow electronic gambling and especially those States that do not allow slot machines. The interest in this amendment from gambling States stems simply from their sincere desire to have the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, enforced. This amendment does not in any way minimize the serious need for proper enforcement of existing law. 
In February, in an attempt to kill our amendment, which was 
only a continuation of the status quo, the Indian Affairs Committee sent out a notice that the amendment should be defeated because hearings had been scheduled. What happened to those hearings? By passing this amendment, we will ensure that the promises about the future won't change the current law. We will make sure that the unelected Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, won't single-handedly change current law. This amendment will ensure that any change in IGRA is done in the right way--legislatively. 
Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that the proper procedures are followed in the tribal-State compacting process. Some people have argued that changes need to be made in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. I don't necessarily disagree with my colleagues on that point. In fact, I would welcome an opportunity to review a number of provisions in IGRA in the proper context. However, if any changes are to be made to IGRA, those changes must come from Congress, not from the administration. By even proposing these regulations, the Secretary of the Interior has shown an amazing disregard for the constitutional role of Congress and the statutory prerogatives of all 50 States. 
Actually, Mr. President, the timing of Secretary Babbitt's actions is rather ironic. In March, just 6 months ago, Attorney General Janet Reno requested an independent counsel to investigate Secretary Babbitt's involvement in denying a tribal-State gambling license to an Indian tribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have to wait for independent counsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her investigation before any final conclusions can be drawn, it is evident that serious questions have been raised about Secretary Babbitt's judgment and objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. 
The very fact that Attorney General Janet Reno believed there was specific and credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be sufficient to make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to grant himself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the States in the area of tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this investigation should have taught us an important lesson: We in Congress should not allow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the Interior, to usurp the rightful role of Congress and the States in addressing the difficult question of casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. 
As this controversial issue has developed, we have been promised hearings in the Indian Affairs Committee. A year ago, I was given the offer to even invite some of the witnesses. From my perspective, if the promise of those proposed hearings had caused us to back off this amendment, the effect would have been that Secretary Babbitt would have had his way today. This sentiment has been confirmed by lobbyists from the various tribes which have made it abundantly clear that Secretary Babbitt fully intends to finalize his proposed rules. Our only way to stop this effort is to attach another amendment to this year's Interior appropriations bill. Let me assure you, if Secretary Babbitt has his way, there will be no need for the tribes to resolve problems at all involving gambling and IGRA in and with their States. 
I do believe that this issue could be resolved with hearings and a bill--actual legislation from us, from Congress. But those hearings won't happen as long as the tribes anticipate the clout of the Secretary's rule that bypasses the process, bypasses the States. Yes, the courts have ruled that the current law--which was passed by Congress, not an appointed Secretary--gives an edge in the bargaining process to the States. But that process has worked. If there is a need to change that process, it should be changed only by a bill passed by Congress--not by rule and regulation. 
I must stress that if we do not maintain the status quo, there will never be an essential involvement by the States in the final decision of whether to allow casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. There will be no compromise reached. The Secretary will be given the right to bypass us, the Congress of the United States, and to run roughshod over the States. 
Again, I want to stress that this amendment does not amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, but holds the status quo for another year so Congress can review the situation. 
Two years ago, Congress voted to establish a national commission to study the social and economic impacts of legalized gambling in the United States. One of the aspects the commission is analyzing is the impact of gambling on tribal communities. As my colleagues know, this commission just began its work last year and most likely will not complete its study for another year. 
It is significant that this commission--the very commission that was created by Congress for the purpose of studying gambling--has now sent a letter to Secretary Babbitt asking him not to go forward with his proposed rules. I would like to read this letter for the benefit of my colleagues.  
Dear Secretary Babbitt: As you are aware, the 104th Congress created the National Gambling Impact Study Commission to study the social and economic impacts of legalized gambling in the United States. Part of our study concerns the policies and practices of tribal governments and the social and economic impacts of gambling on tribal communities. 
During our July 30 meeting in Tempe, Arizona the Commission discussed the Department's `by-pass' provision for tribes who allege that a state had not negotiated for a gaming compact in good faith. The Commission voted to formally request the Secretary of the Interior to stay the issuance of a final rule on Indian compacting pending completion of our final report. On behalf of the Commission, I formally request such a stay, and trust you will honor this request until you have had an opportunity to review the report which we intend to release on June 20, 1999. Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Kay C. James, Chair.  
Mr. President, I think it would be wise for this body to follow the advice of the very commission that we created to study the issue of legalized gambling. 
I want to emphasize again that we are the body that asked for this commission. We created the commission to look at all gambling. The American taxpayers are already paying for the study. The commission is already doing its work. We need to let them finish. They have asked that neither we, nor Secretary Babbitt, make any changes while they do their work. My amendment would give them that time. 
The judicial branch has already preserved the integrity of current law. This amendment supports that. The President approved my amendment last year by signing the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. I'm asking my colleagues to take the same `non-action' once again. The Committee on Indian Affairs must play a very important role here. They need to hold hearings and write legislation which specifically addresses this issue and then put it through the process. They will have time to do that if this amendment is agreed to. This amendment would support giving the Indian Affairs Committee and Congress, as a whole, time to develop an appropriate policy. 
Mr. President, the Enzi-Sessions amendment is strongly endorsed by the National Governor's Association. I would like to read a letter written on behalf of the Governors and which is signed by the entire executive committee. Listen to this very bipartisan appeal. 
Here is the letter: 
As members of the Executive Committee of the National Governors' Association, we urge you on behalf of all governors to adopt the Indian gaming-relating amendment to the Interior Department Appropriations bill sponsored by Sen. Michael B. Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). This amendment would extend the current moratorium preventing the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior from using federal funds to approve tribal-state compacts that have not first been approved by the state, as required by law. The amendment would also prohibit the secretary from promulgating a regulation or implementing a procedure that could result in tribal Class III gaming in the absence of a tribal-state compact or from going forward with any proposed rule on this matter in fiscal 1999.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment is also supported by the National Association of Attorneys General. I would like to read from the attorneys general letter of support. This is an excerpt. 
The Attorneys General believe that the Secretary lacks any statutory authority for the proposed procedures. Twenty-five state Attorneys General led by Attorney General Bob Butterworth filed a letter with the Secretary setting out our views at length. We believe the Secretary must seek statutory amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to achieve the authority he asserts and have encouraged him to engage in a dialogue with states and tribes to work toward that goal.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have also received a number of letters from individual Attorneys General from a number of states, and my colleague from Alabama, who himself was a distinguished State Attorney General before coming to the United States Senate, will discuss these at more length. This letter is also supported by the National League of Cities. I would like to quote from this letter of endorsement. 
This is from the National League of Cities representing the cities and towns across our Nation. 
While further legislation is required to remove the power of the Interior Secretary to administratively create enclaves exempt from state and local regulatory authority, passage of this amendment would be a first step in this process. 
Because passage of the Enzi/Sessions amendment would slow the creation of new trust land in one narrow set of circumstances, NLC urges support of this amendment as a first step. The concept of allowing an appointed federal official to overrule and ignore state and local land use and taxation laws through the creation of trust lands flies in the face of federalism and intergovernmental comity. * * * * * 
The Supreme Court has ruled that provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. (IGRA) violate certain constitutional principles that establish the obligations, immunities and privileges of the states. The Interior Department appears to be determined to implement the remaining provisions of IGRA despite the fact that the Supreme Court decision really requires a congressional re-examination of the IGRA statute and the more general topic of trust land designation. For these reasons, the NLC strongly urges Congress to extend the current moratorium, as proposed in the Enzi/Sessions amendment, through fiscal year 1999.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is a growing number of groups, including the Christian Coalition which is very concerned about the explosion of unregulated gaming in America. I have a letter from the Christian Coalition. I share with you a paragraph from that. 
Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, every State has the right to be directly involved in tribal-state compacts without Federal interference. Every state also has the right, as upheld by the Supreme Court in the Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida decision, to raise its 11th Amendment defense of southern immunity if a tribe tries to sue the state for not approving a casino compact. However, in the wake of the Seminole decision, the Department of Interior has created new rules whereby a tribe can negotiate directly with the Secretary of Interior on casino gambling compacts and bypass a state's rights to be involved. These new rules are a gross violation of states' rights. An unelected cabinet member should not be given sole authority to direct the internal activities of a state, especially with regards to casino gambling contracts. 
Christian Coalition is also very concerned with the severe social consequences of casino gambling. There is much evidence that the rise of casino gambling leads to a rise in family breakdown, crime, drug addiction, and alcoholism. With such staggering repercussions, it is vital that tribal-state gambling contracts remain within each individual state and not be commandeered by an unelected Federal official.

Mr. ENZI. I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any existing tribal-State compact. It does not in any way prevent States and tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are willing to disagree on class 3 gambling on tribal lands within a State's borders. The amendment does ensure that all stakeholders must be involved in the process--Congress, tribes, States, the administration. 
Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming would be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent a lot of money. They even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a lot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the spokesman for the opposition. 
When we first got our meager organization together, the polls showed over 60 percent of the people were in favor of gambling. When the election was held, the casino gambling lost by over 62 percent, and it lost in every single county of our State. The 40-point swing in public opinion happened as people came to understand the issue and the implications of casino gambling in Wyoming. 
That is a pretty solid message. We do not want casino gambling in Wyoming. The people who vote in my State have debated it and made their choice. Any Federal bureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on us will obviously inject animosity. 
Why did we have that decisive a vote? We used a couple of our neighboring States to review the effects of limited casino gambling. We found that a few people--a few people--make an awful lot of money at the expense of everyone else. When casino gambling comes into a State, communities are changed forever and everyone agrees there are costs to the State. There are material costs, with a need for new law enforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are social costs. And not only is gambling addictive to some folks, but once it is instituted, the revenues can be addictive, too. 
But I am not here to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just trying to maintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative solution rather than a bureaucratic mandate. 
Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society as a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A State's law enforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously impacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. Therefore, a State's popularly elected representatives should have a say in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on Indian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an unelected Cabinet official. Passing the Enzi-Sessions amendment will keep all the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all the parties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the time it needs to hear all the sides and work on the legislation to fix any problems that exist in the current system. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for the constitutional role of Congress and for the rights of all 50 States by supporting this amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank everybody involved for all of the great discussion this afternoon. 
I feel compelled to answer some of the questions that were raised during the course of the debate. 
I would like to particularly thank Senator Sessions and all of the other cosponsors who are on the bill cosponsoring the amendment with me. 
I would also like to thank Senator Sessions for the comments on behalf of attorneys general, since he is a former attorney general from Alabama. 
He gave me copies of letters. One is from my own attorney general, William Hill of Wyoming; another is from Mark Barnett of South Dakota; another is from Bill Pryor of Alabama; another individual letter is from Mr. Gale Norton, attorney general of Colorado; another is from the Honorable Carla Stovall, Topeka, KS; another letter is from Robert Butterworth of the State of Florida; another is from Don Stenberg of the State of Nebraska; another is from Frank Kelley of the State of Michigan.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also thank the other Senators who have addressed this along with me, and I want to make some comments on the things that were said. 
I would particularly like to thank the Senator from New Mexico for his comments. More particularly, I would like to thank him for all the education he gave me a year ago when we debated this amendment. That was one of the first amendments that I worked on, and I have to say it needed a lot of work. With his cooperation, and with the Senator from Hawaii, we came up with an amendment that protected the status quo. It was an amendment that we thought would keep things from moving forward and supplanting the States' ability to negotiate it. I found out later that there are even some more careful wordings that have to be done on bills that we work on around here. Had I done it more particularly about finalizing the rule itself, perhaps we would have avoided the need to bring it up again. I didn't. So we need to talk about it some more. 
I mentioned that what we are really trying to do with this amendment is to preclude the finalization of rules and regulations that would supplant the States. I will be one of the first to admit that at the present time the States have the bigger stick. Until the rules get approved and the bigger stick switches hands, and the tribes have the bigger stick and the control of that stick forever--if we leave the stick in the hands of the States, there is an easy way to change that in the interim and to make the kinds of exemptions that the Senator from New Mexico talked about. The way to do that is to have hearings by the Indian Affairs Committee--hearings that are balanced, hearings that take into account how difficult it is to properly negotiate between the States and the tribes. 
We can come up with a compromise piece of legislation. That piece of legislation would eliminate this amendment on an appropriations bill and this amendment in any future years. But we have to have that discussion. We have to see what the arguments are between the States and the tribes and get those resolved. I know there is common ground. We have hit around the edges of it today. But there have been statements on both sides that take it a little bit further each way than probably it ought to be. But I can tell you that we are not going to get it resolved and we will just give the whole stick to the tribes unless we put this amendment on the bill. 
I thank the Senator from Hawaii for the care and concern with which he has spoken in every instance that we have debated this issue. This is the third time. I appreciate today particularly the 20 years of experience that he has on this and the tremendous knowledge that he has about the history of the tribes in the United States. 
I grew up in Sheridan, WY, 60 miles from the Crow Reservation, which is in Montana. But I have had the opportunity to work with them and the tribes in Wyoming before. This is not an attempt to take away from the Indian tribes. This is an attempt to get that fair playing field through hearings, through legislation--not through something by an unelected Secretary of the Federal Government to put it in the hands of Congress. We are the ones who ought to be making these kinds of decisions. If there are decisions left undone, we ought to go back and redo them so that they take care of all the problems. We need to have all of the interested parties. We need to have hearings on it. 
The comment was raised that on my amendment there haven't been hearings. I kind of have to contest that a little bit, because this is the third time we have debated it, which is a form of hearing among the Members. It is not my fault that there have been no hearings on this. The Indian Affairs Committee has not held hearings on this in spite of the requests last year, in spite of that being the primary way that we can bring everybody together to focus on the issue and to come up with a solution that will work for everybody. 
I don't think this is a death knell for the talks between people. Instead, it is the beginning of a process that can work with the Indian Affairs Committee to see that we have some hearings, reach a solution, and bring it to conclusion. It is in the hands of the Indian Affairs Committee. But there is only a need for them to meet on it, if we pass my amendment. 
I ask that you pass the amendment. I will briefly summarize some of the points. 
It maintains the status quo of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for one more year. It preserves the right of Congress to pass laws. It continues the incentive for tribes and States to pursue legislative changes to IGRA. It gives the Indian Affairs Committee time to hold the hearing and recommend the IGRA changes. It prevents Secretary Babbitt from bypassing Congress. It protects States rights without harming the Indian tribes. And it honors the advice of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission so that they can finish their work, as they requested. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky, and I rise in opposition to the McCain-Feingold amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. Rather than `reform' the way campaigns are financed, this amendment would infringe on the first amendment rights of millions of American citizens and place enormous burdens on candidates running for office, and one of our primary obligations here is to preserve the Constitution of the United States. 
While the McCain-Feingold amendment claims to `clean up' elections, it does so by placing unconstitutional restrictions on citizens' ability to participate in the political process. We have heard several Members of the Senate bemoan the fact that various citizen groups and individuals have taken out ads criticizing them during their elections. 
I must admit that I can sympathize with my colleagues who have been the object of often pointed and critical campaign ads. In fact, during my last campaign, some ads were aired against me that were downright false. I do support truth in advertising. Even that, I am told, is an infringement on freedom of speech, and the Washington Supreme Court just ruled that it is OK to lie in campaign advertising. 
How do you counter that? During my campaign, my opponent ran a series of ads that said I put a tax on Girl Scout cookies. Fortunately, Girl Scout cookies were delivered during the campaign, and those poor little girls had to say, `No, he didn't put a sales tax on Girl Scout cookies.' Had it not been for the delivery of those cookies, I would have had to find a lot of money to counter the false advertising done against me. If we can't get truth in advertising, we don't have campaign reform, and that is an infringement on freedom of speech. 
At the same time, I believe in a free society it is essential that citizens have a right to articulate their positions on issues and candidates in a public forum. The first amendment to our Constitution was drafted to ensure that future generations will have the right to engage in public political discourse that is vigorous and unfettered. Throughout even the darkest chapters of our Nation's history, our first amendment has provided an essential protection against inclinations to tyranny. 
The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the first amendment to protect the right of individual citizens and organizations to express their views through issue advocacy. The Court has maintained for over two decades that individuals and organizations do not fall within the restrictions of the Federal election code simply by engaging in this advocacy. 
Issue advocacy includes the right to promote any candidate for office and his views as long as the communication does not `in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.' As long as independent communication does not cross the bright line of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, individuals and groups are free to spend as much as they want promoting or criticizing a candidate and his or her views. While these holdings may not always be welcome to those of us running in campaigns, they represent a logical outgrowth of the first amendment's historic protection of core political speech. 
Mr. President, this amendment, which parades under the disguise of `reform,' would violate these clear first amendment protections. The amendment impermissibly expands the definition of `express advocacy' to cover a whole host of communications by independent organizations. The McCain-Feingold amendment attempts to expand bright-line tests for issue advocacy to include communications which, `in context,' advocate election or defeat of a given candidate. 
Are we comfortable with giving a Federal regulatory agency the power to determine what constitutes acceptable political speech--a Federal regulatory agency the power to determine what constitutes acceptable political speech? 
This amendment gives expansive new powers to the Federal Election Commission. This is one Federal agency which has abused the power it already has to regulate Federal elections. Just last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals strongly criticized the Federal Election Commission for its `unsupportable' enforcement action against the Christian Action Network. The network's only crime was engaging in protected political speech. The Court of Appeals required the Federal Election Commission to pay the network's attorney fees and court costs since the FEC's prosecution had been unjustified. Congress should not condone flagrant administrative abuses by giving the FEC expanded new powers and responsibilities. 
The McCain-Feingold substitute also includes within its new definition of `express advocacy' any communication that refers to one or more clearly identified candidates within 60 calendar days preceding an election. These provisions would allow the speech police to regulate core political speech during the most crucial part of an election cycle. They would also place an economic burden on thousands of small radio and television stations which carry those ads. I don't think we in Washington should be placing any more restrictions on America's small businesses. Our Founding Fathers drafted the first amendment to protect against attempts such as these to prohibit free citizens from entering into public discourse on issues that greatly affect them. 
I cannot support legislation that stifles the free speech of American citizens and gives expanded new powers to a Federal bureaucracy. For these reasons, I must oppose the McCain-Feingold amendment. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the first amendment and opposing the McCain-Feingold substitute and any other amendment that would unconstitutionally restrict the rights of citizens to participate in the democratic process. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment on land mines to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill offered by my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma. This amendment, which seeks to preserve for our military commanders a weapons system which, among other things, mitigates the manpower disadvantage American forces routinely suffer, is needed now more than ever. 
Every day seems to bring fresh evidence of two facts we have known to be true for some time: First, that our military is currently too small and stretched too thin for the many missions assigned to it; and second, that the international security situation is more volatile than it has been in a generation. Both situations argue heavily in favor of this amendment. 
Even the most ardent defenders of our ongoing defense drawdowns cannot help but be alarmed at the sudden lack of trained manpower in our military. Recruiting goals are not being met and our long serving leaders--both officer and enlisted--are leaving the military in droves. One government report after another finds that our front line units are chronically undermanned. Next to these disturbing facts, we see that the situation in North Korea has recently taken a most frightening turn with their launch of a two-stage ballistic missile directly over the Japanese Islands. Japan has pulled out of the Light Water Reactor agreement which was our only real hope of keeping North Korea from resuming their nuclear weapons development program. Between our under strength military, and the new tension on the Korean Peninsula, it could be said that it has been many years since our military forces in South Korea have been in such an insecure and tenuous position. It is not idle hyperbole to say that South Koreans, and the forty thousand American troops who live at the pointy end of the spear in that country, depend on land mines for their lives. 
In light of these developments, I cannot think of a worse time to pass a Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill that includes a provision which would facilitate the signing of the Convention of the Prohibition of anti-personnel land mines, quote--`as soon as practicable.'--unquote. A harmless sounding passage to be sure, but one which, in the hands of an administration prone to trading our national security for parchment, could be interpreted as clearance to sign that dangerous piece of paper. 
Senator Inhofe's amendment would simply require that, before the administration signed any treaty that would take this critically important weapons system from our military, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with the Commanders in Chief of the various Combat Commands, certify that they can accomplish their missions without it. 
Not in the last two decades have tensions been so high in that part of the world, Mr. President. It would seem that every possible factor is now conspiring to place our troops on the precipice: Our military is undermanned and underfunded; our diplomatic initiatives with the world's totalitarian regimes are breaking down everywhere; ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technology is proliferating at breakneck speed; and in Asia, the terrible economic situation there only serves to raise tensions and reduce available peaceful alternatives. I cannot envision a worse time to be taking military options away from our commanders in the field. But let me be clear: Even under the best of circumstances I would be against any attempt to take away military options from those commanders. And I will feel this way with particular regard to anti-personnel land mines until the proponents of this ban can give me a cogent answer to a simple question: How will taking self-destructing, self-deactivating land mines away from the United States military save one life in Angola, Cambodia or Afghanistan? Until I get a clear answer to that question, I will continue to defend our military from these misguided attempts to eliminate the means by which they accomplish the missions America deems fit to assign them, in the safest possible way. I support this amendment from the Senator from Oklahoma, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to take a couple of minutes to talk about global warming and about where we are in the process of getting information from the administration about the Kyoto Treaty. 
Last year, when we were doing appropriations, the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment to the Foreign Operations spending bill. That amendment directed the White House to describe exactly the amounts and locations of all its planned expenditures for domestic and international climate change activities for 1997, 1998, and thereafter. The President signed that bill. 
What I hoped to get was a list, by agency, with their expected costs and objectives. I thought the Office of Management and Budget would be able to easily locate the pots of money involved in something as critical to the administration as global warming. But the President's response was a 2-page letter describing the Climate Change Technology Initiative and the Global Change Research Program. I have gotten more information out of any issue of the newspaper. No numbers were included in the global change research section. No numbers were included showing the money the Department of State has spent negotiating climate change or supporting the U.N.'s scientific bodies. No numbers were included telling us how much `indirect programs' would cost. 
The administration's letter was an unacceptable response to our request, and it took a year to get it.

Mr. ENZI. Since that time, other Members of Congress have been trying diligently to track down these budget numbers. I have tried to get questions answered. I have followed up on administration statements. It has not been easy. The House Government Reform Committee has been forced to issue three subpoenas and has threatened a fourth. In response to those, the administration has made some documents available, but some are still waiting for White House Counsel approval. 
I, too, have encountered obstacles in trying to see those cost numbers. Earlier this year, Janet Yellen, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, testified twice in the House that Kyoto would cost American families only $90 per year--only $90 per year. Estimates from independent economic consulting firms, however, show vastly different numbers. These estimates put costs as high as $2,100 per household per year. Most people that I know think that $90 a year would be a lot of additional tax; $2,100 would be unconscionable. That is a $2,000 difference per year on what it will cost to solve the problem the administration says we have. 
The obvious question is, Why are they so far apart? Why are the White House numbers so low? The Department of Energy places the cost of reducing 1 ton of carbon emissions at $130 to $150, to cut to 1990 levels. The White House uses $171 per ton, to go 7 percent below 1990. If you add it up, the cost is over $100 billion per year, not adjusted for inflation. Factor in inflation and divide by households. The fact is, that $90 per family is not realistic. 
When Ms. Yellen was asked how they came up with the $90, her answer was that the assumptions and models were a national security secret. 
I asked for a copy of those documents. I was told that they were a national security secret. I pointed out that when you get elected to this body, you get a top secret clearance. You are supposed to be able to view all documents necessary to your work. I offered that, if they were so busy that they couldn't deliver those numbers to the Capitol, that I would be happy to go down to the White House and look at those numbers. After some weeks, they did say they might send a few numbers up. 
I asked the Counsel of Economic Advisers nominee, Rebecca Blank, if she could get me a copy. I held up the nomination until they could produce them. I got a series of runs and explanations, but certain critical parts were missing. In fact, what I got is a table of contents with formulas, and no explanation. 
I was also curious to know what part of these documents had been so secret. They were delivered by an intern from the White House to my office, not given to me personally, not stamped `confidential.' There was no stamp on them whatsoever to designate how important these were to national security. So I had to suspect that I had not gotten the documents that we had been talking about. 
I asked about it. I got an interesting response. I would like to share part of that with my colleagues. 
The White House Counsel's Office is concerned that public disclosure of these materials would set an unfortunate precedent that could chill the free flow of internal discussions essential to effective decision making. Counsel believes that such disclosure is not necessary for purposes of Congressional oversight. 
In other words, we don't deserve the information. We should not be a part of that. We don't need to know. And letting us know would damage the Executive's ability to make decisions. 
We are the policy body of the United States. Only with FDR did the President start traveling all over the country, and all over the world, trying to set legislation. That has gone on, on an ever-increasing basis, since that time. It is our job to pass the laws. The laws set the policy. The White House is the management branch of this Government. And they say that our information would interfere in their decisionmaking, it would have a chilling effect.

Mr. ENZI. I do disagree with that. I think the public does have a right to know. What is the point in hiding the information? What is the White House afraid that people might find out? I have a hunch it is all about jobs. The study conducted by DRI-McGraw-Hill estimated Kyoto could cost us 1.5 million jobs. Charles River Associates puts that figure as high as 3.1 million jobs by 2010. 
Even the Argonne National Laboratory pointed to job losses in a study on the impact of higher energy prices on energy-intensive industries. Argonne concluded that 200,000 American chemical workers could lose their jobs. All of the American aluminum plants could close, putting another 20,000 workers out of work. Cement companies would move another 6,000 jobs overseas. And nearly 100,000 United States steelworkers would be out of work. 
Americans have a right to know what is going on. They have a right to know if it is going to cost them their job. 
Mr. President, I ask for a few additional minutes.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, even if the Office of White House Counsel doesn't think so, they should have a chance to see who is playing with their livelihoods. 
In spite of the White House position, the Secretary of Interior had the nerve to call energy companies `un-American in their attempts to mislead the American public.' Remember, they are the only ones disclosing figures. They are the only ones from whom you can get the model, all of the math, and an explanation. They are the ones sharing data. 
The Secretary of Interior had the nerve to call them `un-American in their attempts to mislead the American people.' He further asserted that they were engaged in `a conspiracy to distort the facts.' They are the only ones sharing facts. 
I will repeat that. They were called `un-American in their attempts to mislead the American people.' There are a lot of people working in coal and oil fields in my State, over 20,000 of them. Mr. President, 20,000 people is 6 percent of all the people working in Wyoming. More important, it is over 10 percent of the private sector employees. 
These are the people who work for energy companies. These are the people Mr. Babbitt claims are `un-American.' I think they are worried about their jobs. They are worried about laying off their employees. They are worried about their own families and all the other families who survive in our towns because of energy production. As an industry, these people are worried about a treaty that can force them to lay off over a million Americans. It could force industry to lay off half of their employees in Wyoming. 
On the other hand, the Executive Office of the President finds that, `public disclosure would set an unfortunate precedent' and that it `is not necessary for purposes of Congressional oversight.' I ask just who is misleading the American people? 
There is something else I want to bring to the attention of this body. In spite of the fact that the President has firmly stated that this treaty will not be implemented before ratification, right now the Environmental Protection Agency has undertaken an effort to manipulate the Clean Air Act to enact it. 
I think we deserve to know what other branches of Government are currently working behind the scenes, behind our back, to make changes through Executive orders or rules and regulations that put a treaty into place that this body would not ratify. If it were brought here today, it would not be ratified. It violates everything in the resolution that we adopted, sending signals to the people who went to Kyoto to negotiate on behalf of the United States. 
There has been no public input. I think the administration does not want public input on climate change. I know they don't want to look at the science, but I think they also don't want public input. If they wanted input, this letter from the Executive Office wouldn't say what it does. If the White House wanted the public to know all the details about the treaty, they would send it to the Senate and America, and they would let us debate it. They would tell the American people what they are planning to do. 
My only experience in the executive branch was as mayor of a boom town. But I can tell you, when I was trying to pass the smallest bond issue or when I was working on negotiations on industrial siting, figuring out what the companies that were coming to our counties would have to do to participate in the growth of our town so we could have orderly growth, if I would not have shared on a regular basis more information, more detail, more explanation for those little things than what the President is doing with us on this big thing, I would not have been able to do any of them, and I should not have been able to do any of them. 
It is the duty of the executive branch to inform the people who make the decisions legislatively, to provide them with all of the information that can possibly be provided and not just to send out a group of numbers with no explanation, a bunch of abbreviations with no explanation. We don't need a table of contents. We don't need a bunch of math. We need answers. We need to know the formulas, and we need to be able to have people who understand those numbers take a look at them. 
This is not national security. This is a need for the American public to know, and the American public in this case probably ought to start with the U.S. Senate. We do have the kind of authority that we should be able to get the numbers, and if the President wants cooperation from us, he will provide those numbers. We can take them the way he wants. We can take them in secret, but I hope they will share them with us and with the American public.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the selection of an image of Sacajawea for the new one dollar coin. The Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee recently recommended to the Treasury Secretary that the new dollar coin bear a design inspired by Sacajawea. On July 29th, the Treasury Secretary announced that he was accepting the Committee's recommendation. I am pleased that the committee and the Treasury Secretary have recognized the important role of Sacajawea in the history of our Nation. 
I do believe that it is important, however, that the coin explicitly honor and bear a likeness of Sacajawea. The actual language of the committee's recommendation is that the coin should bear a design of `Liberty represented by a Native American woman, inspired by Sacajawea and other Native American women.' This language is a bit vague, but it does make it clear that Sacajawea is their symbolic choice. I strongly urge the Treasury Secretary to approve a final design that is based on a historically accepted image of Sacajawea. There are several images that could be used, and I will be happy to share them with the Secretary. 
Mr. President, I am distressed to learn that a bill has been introduced in Congress that would overturn the recommendation and subsequent acceptance of the depiction of Sacajawea on the new one dollar coin. As we know, Congress specifically refrained from mandating a design for the coin when we passed the authorizing legislation. This was to ensure that political pressures would not affect the decision-making process. Instead, the Treasury Secretary appointed the Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee, which was specifically charged with coming up with a design for the coin, subject to some general guidelines from the Secretary. The selection process of the advisory committee emphasized citizen participation. After a thorough and open debate, the committee voted 6-1 to recommend Sacajawea for the dollar coin. Unfortunately, that whole process could be undermined by the bill that has been introduced. We are beyond debating the merits of Sacajawea or the Statue of Liberty. Arguments against her image obviously were not persuasive. I see no reason for Congress to attempt to impose its will and reverse a decision that was made by an unbiased panel 
based on extensive input from the American people. 
Mr. President, I sent a letter to the Treasury Secretary earlier this month requesting that he accept the committee's recommendation of Sacajawea for the new one dollar coin. In that letter, I outlined some of the reasons that I think she would be a great choice for the coin. I would like to briefly discuss these reasons right now. 
As most Americans know, Sacajawea was an integral part of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the story of which is an incredible tale of adventure, determination, cooperation, and persistence. When Lewis and Clark set out for the West, they had no idea what they might find in the coming months or how long they would be gone. Anyone who has traveled through the West has to be in awe of what the Lewis and Clark expedition was able to accomplish. It is remarkable that Sacajawea was just a teenager with an infant when she endured the rigors of this trip into uncharted territory. 
The importance of Sacajawea to the Lewis and Clark expedition can not be understated. Her knowledge of the land and its resources helped the expedition survive the rugged terrain of the West. Her diplomatic and translation skills helped Lewis and Clark establish peaceful relations with the American Indians they met along the way, whose assistance was also vital to the expedition. Her bravery saved the expedition's valuable supplies, including the journals that would be used to record the trip, after a boat nearly capsized. Lewis and Clark's appreciation of her skills and resourcefulness led them to grant her a vote on the operation of the expedition that was equal to the other members of the group. In a very real sense, this is the first recorded instance of a woman being allowed to vote in America. I am proud to note that Wyoming, which typifies the landscape of their journey, also recognized the important role of women in overcoming the challenges of the West and was the first state to grant women the right to vote. 
I believe that the selection of Sacajawea to be represented on the dollar coin would not only celebrate her valuable contribution to the Lewis and Clark expedition, it would also celebrate the contributions of all American Indians during the expedition. In addition, it would honor all the American Indians of our nation; it would celebrate the greatest terrestrial exploration ever undertaken in U.S. history; and, it would commemorate the turning of our country's hearts and minds from Europe and the East--to the West and our future. 
Mr. President, I urge the Treasury Department to continue the process of selecting an image of Sacajawea for the dollar coin. I also urge the Treasury Department to specifically designate and honor Sacajawea as the person on the coin. And finally I encourage my colleagues to oppose any measure that would undermine the placement of Sacajawea on the dollar coin. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this bill that was just passed by the Senate will dramatically improve workplace safety and health for more than 800,000 U.S. Postal Service employees. Senate bill 2112, the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act, will bring the Postal Service under the full jurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It is my firm belief that government must play by its own rules, that all Federal agencies must comply with the 1970 occupational safety and health statute. They are not required to pay penalties issued to them by OSHA. They will be under this bill. The lack of any enforcement tool renders compliance requirements for the subsector ineffective, at best. 
My first look at this occurred when I noticed that Yellowstone National Park had been cited for over 600 violations. Ninety of them were serious. One of them was failure to report a death. 
It occurred to me, though, that they may not be the worst violators, so I checked on the Federal Government and found that the agency that we needed to start with was the U.S. Postal Service. 
What is most troubling about the Postal Service's safety record is its annual workers' compensation payments. From 1992 to 1997, the Postal Service paid an average of $505 million in workers' compensation costs, placing them once again at the top of the Federal Government's list. Moreover, the Postal Service's annual contribution to workers' compensation amounts to almost one-third of the Federal Government's $1.8 billion price tag. 
In 1970, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act, eliminating the old Postal Department status as a Cabinet office. Twelve years later, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient and is to be congratulated on that. 
After carefully listening to the perspectives of the Post Office and the unions representing its employees, I have concluded that the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act is necessary legislation. S. 2112 addresses specialized problems in a specialized business by permitting OSHA to fully regulate the Postal Service the way it does private businesses. In addition, the bill would prevent the Postal Service from closing or consolidating rural post offices or services simply because it is required to comply with OSHA. Service to all areas in the Nation, rural or urban, was made a part of the Postal Service's mission by the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act. The quality of service it provides should not decrease because of efforts to protect and ensure employee safety and health. 
Along this same premise, the bill would prevent the Postal Rate Commission from raising the price of stamps to help the Postal Service pay for potential OSHA fines. Rather, the Postal Service should offset the potential for the fines by improving the workplace conditions. That is what we have been trying to do on all OSHA work that we have done--to get more safety and health in the workplace. That would decrease the Postal Service annual $505 million expenditure on workers' comp claims, and, more importantly, it would keep those employees safe. That is why the money won't have to be spent. 
I do not believe that this incremental bill should be looked on as an expansion of regulatory enforcement. For years OSHA has been inspecting the Federal work sites and issuing citations to those who are not in compliance. This will continue, whether this bill is signed into law or not. S. 2112 would simply require the Postal Service to pay any fine issued by OSHA to the General Treasury, expediting abatement of safety and health hazard. 
Abating occupational safety and health hazards should be a top priority of any employer. Now, the U.S. Postal Service recently announced a $100 million program to entice kids to collect stamps. I don't question the validity of such a program or the benefit it would have on the Nation's kids. However, I do question whether this program should be a priority while workers' compensation claims and injuries, illness, lost time, and fatality rates remain so high. 
We must ensure the safety and health of all employees because they are the most important asset of any business. The success or failure of any business, including the Post Office, rests on their ability to provide efficient care and service to their customers. 
In my capacity as a Senator, I have committed much of my time to the advancement of workplace safety and health by advocating commonsense, incremental legislation. While it is important for OSHA to retain its ability to enforce the law and respond to employee complaints in a timely fashion, the agency must also begin to broaden its preventive initiatives in an effort to bring more workplaces into compliance before accidents and fatalities occur. 
I want to extend my sincere thanks to Senator Bingaman for coauthoring the Postal Employees Safety Advancement Act. I believe all stakeholder meetings have paid off--producing a balanced, incremental piece of legislation. Chairman Jeffords of the Senate Labor Committee and ranking member, Senator Kennedy, are to be commended for their steady commitment to advancing occupational safety and health. I also thank their staffs for all of the time that they spent on it. I particularly congratulate and express my appreciation to Chris Spear of my staff, and the other people on my team in the office who have been helping on a day-by-day, grind-it-out basis to work on all occupational safety and health. I am thankful for all the time that everyone has spent discussing this important issue with me. 
I also want to thank all of the cosponsors. This is a very bipartisan bill. Their support is greatly appreciated. 
Finally, I want to thank Congressman Greenwood for authoring the House version and subcommittee chairmen Ballenger and McHugh for their careful consideration in their respective subcommittees. Their work has helped to make this a real team effort.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that is sponsored by the Senator from Nebraska. I support this amendment which would place limitations on the amount of commercial lending by credit unions. I am concerned that if the credit unions concentrate on commercial loans, they will lose their current individual customer focus. They may lose the special identity that separates them from banks and thrifts. I fear that if the special identity of the credit union is lost, Congress may feel the need to treat them identically to banks and thrifts. That could lead to levying taxes on credit unions. 
Currently, credit unions are tax exempt because they are considered cooperatives. In order for a credit union to effectively serve its members, particularly in light of H.R. 1151, which has the potential to greatly increase the membership of the credit unions, it should concentrate on consumer lending. This will encourage it to maintain focus on its member owners. Money loaned to businesses isn't available for consumer lending, meaning that there will be fewer mortgages, car loans and other forms of consumer credit for the members. 
I am particularly pleased that this amendment also includes the deletion of the exemption of a loan less than $50,000 from being defined as a member business loan. As an accountant, I am concerned about the consequences of not requiring full and complete disclosure of lending by credit unions. I place great emphasis and value on the accuracy of financial institutions' records. 
I have asked several credit unions how much commercial lending they engage in now, and none have been able to state precisely the amount because of this strange exemption that currently exists in the regulations. This causes me great concern, because the most stringent safety and soundness provisions are ineffective if accurate records and accurate recordkeeping practices do not exist. I feel it is of utmost importance to require that all member business loans be designated as such, not just those above $50,000. Markets and financial institutions perform best when there is transparency and accuracy of information. We have seen the consequences of that not being available. 
The United States has become the model for financial markets, in part because of the transparent accounting methods that are required of financial institutions and publicly traded companies. I believe credit unions should also be obligated to be transparent in their loan activities. It is only common sense to delete this exemption for commercial loans less than $50,000. There is absolutely no reason for inaccurate accounting. 
In conclusion, this amendment will require credit unions to remain focused on consumer lending. Credit unions were intended to serve the basic needs of families and individuals since the Federal Credit Union Act in the 1930s. This amendment will help credit unions remain unique institutions, setting them apart from other financial service providers. 
I believe a vote for this amendment is a vote for credit union members. I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment sponsored by the senior Senator from Alabama. 
The amendment, which authorizes an exemption for banks with less than $250 million in assets, would allow small banks to escape the burdensome, federal government mandate of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, commonly known as CRA. In 1977, Congress felt that the regulated and insured financial institutions should be required to demonstrate that their deposit facilities help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered. 
However, I have seen the CRA become a burdensome federal government mandate on private financial institutions resulting in nothing more than excessive paperwork requirements. Small community banks naturally serve the needs of their communities, otherwise they would not survive. In Wyoming, where many towns have only one or two banks and maybe a credit union, the financial institutions must reach out to everyone in the community in order to be successful. 
We must also realize that several things have changed since the passage of the community Reinvestment Act became law in 1977. Until 1994, when Congress passed the Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, banks were not allowed to acquire another bank in another state. The Reigle-Neal Act forced small community banks to be more aggressive to meet the needs of their community in order to compete with outside banks, thus supplanting the need for the CRA. 
Second, we now have less government intervention on the rate of interest payable on savings deposits and demand deposits. Before the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, there was a ceiling on the interest rates on savings deposits and a prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits to consumers. We do not have these restrictions now. These laws, passed after the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, have promoted a healthy competition for deposits and credit, thus causing financial institutions to increasingly reach out to the communities they serve. 
I believe it is prudent and right to exempt small banks from CRA requirements. They are the very institutions that comply every day with the Community Reinvestment Act just by the very nature of their business. And they are the institutions that are most burdened by the required paperwork because of their limited resources. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I oppose the Craig amendment, which will change gambling in the United States as we currently know it. It will give legal validity to the claims that the tribes have that they can provide gambling all over the United States. They cannot; it is illegal. This amendment would give them a monopoly on the Internet in every home in America, without any age discrimination. That is the reason we require it to be on premises, so we can check to see if kids are gambling. This will eliminate enforcement in States like mine where we have had a referendum on gambling. 
It was defeated 2-to-1 in every single county in our State. We do not want gambling in Wyoming. We defeated it soundly. This would allow gambling in Wyoming. This would give national legal validity. This will replace lotteries across the State, when they can finally advertise it to the extent that they really want to do it. This will provide for eventual, complete electronic gambling for every home in America, without any State being able to oppose it. 
I ask you to oppose the Craig amendment and support the Kyl amendment.

Mr. ENZI. I yield from the time 1 minute. 
I wish that I had 1 hour. This could be the most important thing we debate in this session of Congress. Yes, there is Indian gambling. Yes, there is some limited gambling on the Internet. The wording in this amendment can change the national flow. This can provide for a national lottery by an Internet monopoly--an Internet monopoly. This could eliminate the grocery store sales in each person's State that allows a lottery at the present time, because it would be much easier to pick it up on the Internet. 
There is a good reason why gambling is limited to on premises for the most part. That is so you can enforce the age requirements. That is so you can check on the different kinds of gaming that there are, so you can check on the dollar limits that there are, so you can audit the process. The Internet is not something you can audit. This will not be a protection for any of the States. 
Some of our States have had a referendum on whether we want any kind of local gambling, whether we want any kind of State gambling. And it has lost 2 to 1. We do not want gambling in Wyoming. But there is no protection against gambling in Wyoming. There is no protection on age in Wyoming. So kids can take parents' credit cards, get into this national lottery and violate State law. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the popular issue of health care quality. You can't mention health care without pulling on everyone's heartstrings. While several of the measures in both the House and the Senate have been pitched as being essential to enhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my colleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any Federal one-size-fits-all mandate would have on our Nation's health care system. 
Health care is as personal as it gets. More importantly, though, our decisions must not be tainted by simple anecdotes. This is not a one-line sound bite issue. Like any Member of this body, I believe that America's health care providers are the best in the world, and I believe that our health care system is the most technologically advanced in the world--the most technologically advanced in the world. Perhaps we don't hear that enough. The reason for that could be that this issue is being used by some folks as a political ad campaign, dwelling entirely on the negatives and failing to illustrate any positives. That is not rational, that is not fair. People are prone to believe something if they hear it enough, even if it isn't true. Repetition doesn't right a wrong, although repetition may lead a person to think a wrong is right. 
While watching this debate unfold, I have seen people wield surveys and polls around this body like they were weapons of mass destruction. It stands to reason that if you want to make a bill popular, back it up with a survey or a poll. Why? Because you can always get the answer you want by the way you word the questions. 
Legislating our Nation's health care system in such a fashion is like trying to cross a chasm in two jumps. It is detrimental to everyone's health. 
I will, however, illustrate how unreliable survey and poll results have been in relation to various health care quality provisions. For instance, in May, a Democratic polling firm showed that 86 percent of those questioned supported the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act or PARCA bill. In the same month, a Republican poll found that more than 90 percent of those questioned favored federal legislation to guarantee protections such as full information about their conditions and treatment options, a list of benefits and costs, as well as access to specialists. 
But when folks were asked how they feel about their own health plan, an April survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute showed that 53 percent of respondents were extremely or very satisfied with their health plan. And in a November 1997 Kaiser/Harvard survey, 66 percent of Americans in managed care plans said they would give their own health plan a grade of A or B. Such mixed results are more reason to approach any debate of federal mandates with the greatest degree of caution. 
What would the polls show if people were asked about additional costs? What would the polls show if changes could eliminate being able to see a doctor at all? 
I will talk in a minute about the frontier, the rural, aspects of that. 
Yes, another factor that has produced mixed results is the cost of each of these bills. I've seen estimates for a number of pending bills that could raise the price of premiums by at least 2.7 percent all the way up to 23 percent. Why aren't the people being polled about that? I don't believe that you can get quality out of any bill that forces people not to purchase insurance. We'd essentially be driving people away from coverage, not toward coverage. This is why cost estimates for the different proposals are vital. But with mixed results like this, I'm not about to assume that my constituents--who budget their incomes on a day to day basis--will swallow any additional price increases that federal mandates could create. 
We are always asked that we not judge a book by its cover. Well, don't judge a bill by its title. The devil is in the details. Or, as we accountants like to say, the numbers should make us nervous, or the numbers should show the nightmare. 
Aside from the morass of misleading information pertaining to this issue, I also have serious reservations about any legislation that would dismantle traditional state regulation of the health insurance industry. While serving in the Wyoming State Legislature for 10 years, I gained tremendous respect for our state insurance commissioner's ability to administer quality guidelines that cater to the unique type of care found in Wyoming. That is critical. I firmly believe that decisions which impact my constituent's health insurance should continue to be made in Cheyenne--not Washington. 
I cannot emphasize how important it is to consider demographics when debating health care. Wyoming has 465,000 residents living within 97,000 square miles. 
That is living in a State that is 500 miles on a border. We are one of those square States that couldn't exist if somebody hadn't invented the square. There are 99,000 square miles with only 465,000 residents. The State has an average elevation exceeding 4,000 feet. We have high altitude and low multitude. 
Most communities have a higher altitude than population. In fact, if you look at one of the Wyoming roadmaps, you will find a list of about 150 cities. We call them cities out there. If you look at the population following the name of the city, you will see that half of them have no population at all. They are a place where the ranchers come to pick up their mail. Even the Postmaster doesn't live in the town where the Post Office is. It is a long way between towns. I live in the sixth largest town in the State. It is 135 miles to the next biggest town--135 miles. The town I am from has 22,000 people. The biggest city in Wyoming is 50,006. We don't have that much population. We have a lot of miles. It is tough to get to doctors. 
It's in those conditions that my constituents have to drive up to 125 miles one-way just to receive basic care. Moreover, we have a tough enough time enticing doctors to come to Wyoming, let alone keep them there once their residency is finished. Even more troubling is the limited number of facilities for those doctors to practice medicine in Wyoming. Let me just say that if you don't have doctors, or facilities for them to practice in, you sure don't have quality health care. 
We have even talked here about an overabundance of doctors in parts of the country. In Wyoming, we wish for that affliction. 
The majority of bills now pending consideration in the House and Senate are primarily geared to overhauling managed health care plans. In a rural, under-served state like Wyoming, managed care plans account for a very small percentage of state-wide health plans and services currently available. This is partly due to the state's small population. Managed care plans generally profit from high enrollment, and as a result, the majority of plans in Wyoming still remain fee-for-service. In terms of legislation, however, this doesn't make a bit of difference. Many fee-for-service insurers in my state also offer managed care plans elsewhere. Those costs could be distributed across the board. Is it fair for the federal government to force my constituents to pay for a premium hike that's caused by federal mandates on managed care? The availability and cost of care for 465,000 rural frontier residents may not mean much to some folks, but it sure means a great deal to me. 
Is this a problem that can be fixed from Washington? I certainly don't believe so. People from Wyoming understand that life in our state is much different than in California or New York. A one-size-fits-all policy doesn't help states like Wyoming, it only excludes them further from obtaining the type of care they deserve. I encourage my colleagues to look at the fine print when considering legislation in the coming days. You just might agree that getting quality out some of these bills is like trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip. And we'll want to spend some time talking about whose blood! 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of the conference report to the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Passage of this legislation marks a monumental step in making the Internal Revenue Service more responsible to `We, the people,' the American taxpayers. 
As the hearings before the Senate Finance Committee demonstrated, the IRS has all too often in recent years taken an adversarial posture against taxpayers. We in the Senate heard reports about IRS employees who were promoted based on the number of liens and collection actions against taxpayers. We heard stories about the IRS targeting low-income individuals and small businesses for audits, since they often did not have the resources to fight the IRS and are therefore forced to settle. We were told about audits and investigations based purely on political motives. We were informed of times the IRS had destroyed businesses, where they had wreaked havoc on private citizens' personal lives and seized assets based on accounting mistakes and clerical errors by the IRS itself. It is time these activities came to an end. This IRS reform bill will make the institution more service oriented and accountable to `We, the people.' 
Through the newly created oversight board, the Service will receive the direction and effective strategic planning it desperately needs. By shifting the burden of proof in factual tax disputes from the taxpayer to the IRS, this bill gives American taxpayers important procedural protections that even criminal defendants have enjoyed in this country for over 200 
years. `We, the people,' will have due process before confiscation of personal property. The taxpayer will know the charges and have the right of appeal. 
By expanding the confidential communications to cover accountants and enrolled agents as well as attorneys, this reform bill gives taxpayers greater freedom to seek tax advice from the tax adviser of their own choosing. 
In requiring the IRS to collect allegations and document cases of employee misconduct and report this misconduct to Congress every year, the IRS reform bill requires the IRS to investigate itself and answer to Congress for any misconduct of IRS employees. 
This reform bill even simplifies the Tax Code by reducing the holding period for optimal capital gains treatment from 18 months to the standard 12 months. 
While the IRS reform bill does not provide all the solutions to our country's tax problems, it marks a significant chapter in bringing greater accountability to our Federal tax collection agency and greater respect for hard-working American taxpayers. The IRS reform bill moves us in the right direction, toward a system that is simpler and more fair for all Americans. 
Yes, `We, the people,' have won a big one here. I congratulate Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee. I also congratulate all the folks who shared--even though they were living in fear of their own Government. I am glad we were able to take these steps and look forward to the results. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the two bills just passed by the Senate were authored by my good friend, Congressman Ballenger. 
H.R. 2864, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Compliance Assistance Authorization Act, and H.R. 2877, a bill to eliminate the imposition of quotas in the context of OSHA's enforcement activities, are intended to help increase the joint cooperation of employees, employers, and OSHA in the effort to ensure safe and healthful working conditions. These bills are the first in a series of efforts to modernize the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, a law which has only been amended one time, in 1990, and that amendment was simply an effort to raise the amount of the fines. So this is the first substantial change in 27 years. 
Since its inception, OSHA has consistently relied upon an adversarial approach rather than placing a greater emphasis on a collaborative strategy geared toward increasing worker safety and health. Agency officials have admitted that 95 percent of the employers in the country do their level best to try to voluntarily comply with the law. Unfortunately, OSHA inspectors still treat employers as adversaries, issuing them citations for what they haven't done and not assisting them in complying with regulations to make the workplace safer. 
Positive changes in the relationship that exists between employers and OSHA are long overdue. It is not productive to threaten employers with fines for noncompliance when millions of safety-conscious employers don't know how they are supposed to comply. Nor is it effective to burden employers with more compliance materials than they can possibly digest or understand. 
To achieve a new cooperative approach, the vast majority of employers who are concerned about worker safety and health must have compliance assistance programs made more accessible to them. Creating true partnerships between businesses and OSHA will ultimately empower the honest employers to improve worker safety while allowing OSHA to concentrate its enforcement efforts on the small number of employers who constitute the `bad actors.' I firmly believe that H.R. 2864 is a good first step in accomplishing just that. 
H.R. 2877 would eliminate enforcement quotas for OSHA compliance inspectors. This language would prohibit OSHA from establishing a specific number of citations issued or the amount of penalties collected. I believe that inspectors must not face institutional pressure to issue citations or to collect fines but, rather, they should work to identify potential hazards and assist the employer in abating them. OSHA's success must depend upon whether the Nation's workforce is safer and healthier and not upon meeting or surpassing goals for inspection citations or penalties. 
Congress' approach to OSHA is different this session. During my tenure in the Senate, I have committed much of my time to the advancement of workplace safety and health. This commitment is shared by my House colleagues, Representatives 
Ballenger and Talent, who are both authors of other commonsense incremental legislation. It is our belief that OSHA has operated since its inception as a reactionary regulator, inspecting work sites primarily after a fatality or injury has occurred. In 1994 and early 1995 alone, three-quarters of the work sites in the United States that were the scene of serious accidents had never--had never--been inspected by OSHA during the decade. Even more troubling is that OSHA officials acknowledge that their inspectors do not investigate most lethal work sites until after accidents occur. Thus, a worker essentially has to get hurt or killed in order for OSHA to act. 
We all want prevention. We don't want accidents. We don't even want near misses. A near miss is an accident about to happen. 
While it is important for OSHA to retain its ability to enforce law and to respond to employee complaints in a timely fashion, the agency must begin to broaden its preventive initiatives in an effort to bring more workplaces into compliance before accidents and fatalities occur. These bills are the first of several rational, incremental steps in making OSHA a preventive regulator, not a reactionary regulator. 
As the Senate author of S. 1237, the Safety Advancement for Employees Act, or SAFE Act, it is my hope that this important legislation will also be considered in the same sensible light. This bill was derived from the thoughts, suggestions, and good ideas of employees, employee representatives, employers, and certified safety and health professionals prior to even its original draft--comments that helped us keep out a number of past contentious provisions. 
I listened carefully to these concerns, and, as a result, the SAFE Act was crafted to promote and enhance workplace safety and health rather than dismantle it. What is left out of that bill may be as important as what is in the bill. 
The contentious parts from the past are not there. The two provisions that we passed tonight are there. The spirit of cooperation must overpower polarization if true improvements in occupational safety and health are to be achieved. It is essential that stereotypical rhetoric be set aside, with the understanding that an overwhelming majority of employers cherish their most valuable assets: their employees. Without the employee, management would ultimately have no production, no profits, and no business. It is logical to surmise that by promoting cooperation, good business will ultimately prevail. We cannot rest as long as there are injuries or deaths on the job. We need everyone involved in safety. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to continue along this path. Much remains to be done in the area of workplace safety and health. There are currently 6.2 million American work sites being inspected by 2,451 Federal and State OSHA inspectors. Under these conditions, it will take OSHA 167 years to visit every workplace before an accident or fatality occurs. That is entirely unacceptable. We must continue to advocate cooperative compliance initiatives, incentives to the employers to look at the job before an accident happens, initiatives that are strictly in line with preventive regulation. 
We must see that OSHA does not get an IRS image. We must see that everyone goes home whole. I will continue to advocate this type of an approach in the coming weeks when additional measures will be considered. I urge my colleagues to both note the change in attitude on the House side and the Senate side on the work being done on OSHA, and I urge my Senate colleagues to help us work on these bills. 
I thank Senator Frist, who is the subcommittee chairman, and Senator Wellstone, who is the subcommittee ranking member. I thank the chairman of the Labor Committee, Senator Jeffords, and the ranking member of the committee, Senator Kennedy. I, in fact, thank all of the Labor Committee members on both sides of the aisle for the time and care and interest that they have shown in the OSHA issue. 
I give special mention, of course, to Congressman Talent, who has taken the SAFE Act on the House side and worked diligently on it and held hearings and just been a great promoter of the new attitude on improving workplace safety. I also congratulate Chairman Ballenger on the first change in the OSHA Act in 27 years. 
I would be remiss if, last but not least, I did not thank my excellent staff for the diligence, care, and persistence that they have put into all of the research and all of the meetings we have had with any group that was willing to meet with us across the entire country. That is what has resulted in being able to take this first step and what will result in future steps. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Also, the Senate can be expected to consider, prior to the Independence Day recess, the higher education bill. Therefore, Members can expect a busy session Thursday and Friday of this week.

Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise today to strongly endorse the amendment of my friend, the Senior Senator from Kansas. This amendment would simply require the housing of male and female recruits in separate barracks during recruit training. 
It amazes me that this amendment is even necessary. Every attempt to return common sense to our military's recruit training policies has been obstructed by this administration--even those attempts initiated by the administration itself. Didn't the Secretary of Defense already convene a panel of distinguished military and civil rights experts to study this serious problem? Didn't this commission--the Kassebaum Commission--unanimously point out the critical importance of--among other things--giving each gender its own recruit housing? Hasn't the administration had over five years to make their misguided gender neutral policies work without success? Sadly and inexplicably, the answer to all these questions is yes. 
Now we have another commission. Are we going to continue to appoint and pay for commissions until we reach an answer that we like? Are we going to find it easier to appoint a commission than to make a decision? I believe this tactic is called paralysis by analysis. I also believe that the appropriate time to criticize a commission is before they report, not after. 
A few days of orientation for new recruits before they are kicked into the hormonal situation that we are putting them in would be helpful. 
Mr. President, the administration's arguments in favor of their social engineering are misleading, contradictory and quite unprecedented. How are they misleading? The Secretary of Defense has tried to garner support for his gender neutral training policies on the grounds that the military simply cannot do without women. The fact, however, is that no one on any side of this debate is advocating that women be purged from our military, and it is patently offensive to me that he would indicate that we are. We fully understand the importance of women to the functioning of our military. All we are trying to do with this amendment is to give both genders a training environment in which they can realize their fullest potential. 
How are the administration's arguments contradictory? They argue that the military must train as it fights. They argue that since men and women serve together, they must train together, and be housed together. Yet one of the things discovered by the Kassebaum commission is that while male recruits are required to throw a hand grenade 35 meters, female recruits are only required to throw it 25 meters. Is the Secretary of Defense implying that our military intends to make sure our female soldiers are always 10 meters closer to the enemy than our male soldiers? Though this amendment would not address issues of training such as this, this type of thinking is indicative of the contradictory quality which pervades all aspects of this administration's recruit training policies--to include housing. 
How are the administration's arguments unprecedented? It is surely unprecedented to place a political agenda of social engineering above the simple requirements of national security. Five years of gender neutral training barracks have resulted only in lowered morale, one sex scandal after another, recruiting shortfalls for every branch but the Marine Corps which does not engage in this incredible practice, and a refusal of this administration to face these problems. It is noteworthy that eighteen months after the sex scandals at Aberdeen, the Kassebaum Commission found that the policies which precipitated them had still not been corrected. The Army, like the Navy and Air Force, have proven singularly unsuccessful in solving the problems associated with these misguided policies--policies which deny the existence of any emotional dynamics between young men and young women. This is less a reflection on the earnestness with which our military leaders have tried to implement these policies, than it is an indictment of these unworkable gender neutral policies themselves. Mr. President, this amendment represents a common sense step in the right direction. It is sorely needed and I encourage all members to support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, and the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions. I believe that the least we can do is assure that the tobacco legislation does not become a lottery for trial lawyers at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
We have been debating this for several weeks. It has been mentioned that we have been debating it for several weeks. Usually, when we debate for 2 or 3 days on a bill, my constituents start calling and saying, `Why don't you get that wrapped up, over with?' I have to tell you that those calls are not coming in. There is a fascination with the debate here--a fascination, an interest, and a very deep concern, because this could be the precedent for a whole bunch of other kinds of products. There is an interest in the attorneys' fees because this could set a precedent for other product attorneys' fees. 
Why are we doing this as part of Federal legislation? Well, if the States would have been able to resolve this all on their own, the Federal Government would not have been involved in it. But that is not the point where we are. We are at the point where the Federal Government is going ahead on its own with a tobacco bill, not a tobacco settlement. We are in the process of taxing folks in the United States who smoke. When we finish taxing those people in the United States, there are some outstanding attorneys' fees that we will be paying out of the Federal funds. 
We have to be concerned about the money and how much money is going to the attorneys. This is not just a matter of letting the States do their own thing. This is a case where the States said: We need to have your involvement. And of course they do. It is interstate commerce. There are a whole bunch of constitutional issues that come into this that require Federal participation. We are now in this Federal participation. We say: Companies, you reached an agreement, but we don't agree with your agreement. And so we do our own thing and we start at $68.5 billion. We decided that wasn't enough money, and we raised it another couple hundred billion dollars, and maybe a couple hundred million dollars more than that. We are still coming up with ideas for spending money. That is easy. That is a normal thing. When the family has a little extra money, they are always able to figure out ways to spend it. 
But we are talking about taking some of that money and giving it to people for a job that they did do. But we are saying, if we are responsible for that money, we want to show responsibility for that money, and we think the responsibility for the money says that an attorney shouldn't get more than $1,000 an hour. 
Again, I can tell from the people who are getting hold of my office that they think $1,000 is a bit too high. In fact, they think it is a whole lot too high for tax money to be collected from tobacco and given out to other people as a precedent for the United States--$1,000 an hour. There are a lot of people in my State who do not make that much in a month. They see that as a lot of money. I see that as a lot of money--$1,000 an hour. 
This is just a precedent. That is why we have to talk about it so carefully. We are talking about those terrible tobacco companies. They withheld information. They do have a drug that is addictive. But they are not the only people perhaps out there. I started keeping a list of the things that my constituents, the voters, the folks back home, think that we ought to put on the list next. I get a lot of calls for liquor and a lot of calls about caffeine. What don't we know about caffeine? 
It is getting to the point on this list now where I thought maybe a project for the Senate might be to, each day, as a part of morning business, bring in a tray similar to a dessert cart that they serve to you at a restaurant that has different products on it, and we would try those products and determine how beneficial or how harmful they were to people and set a new tax on those. This might solve tax simplification for the whole Nation, because by the time we go through all the food products in the Nation and decide what a punitive tax we ought to put on them for information we don't know about them, that leaves a wide range and we will not need any other form of tax, except of course we will be figuring out new ways to spend the money as we go along. 
The amendment before us would require the lawyers to provide a detailed accounting of their legal work to Congress in relation to the legal actions covered by the underlying bill, including any fee arrangements entered into. Then it would limit the payment of the attorneys' fees to $1,000 an hour. 
I know people are wondering why that is a limitation. Of course, I am sure they are hearing that there are some out there that are may be getting $88,000 an hour or $92,000 an hour. Then when they are checking, they are finding out that it is the wealthy and the connected lawyers who are being able to line their pockets from the settlements supposedly made on behalf of the American public. This bill would impose one of the most regressive taxes in America history on low-income Americans. Then we have to debate whether it is fair to limit somebody to $1,000 an hour. 
Mr. President, to put these figures in a little bit of context, last year the average gross receipts for the 100 top grossing law firms in America averaged $18 million. That was for an entire firm--$18 million. If this tobacco bill is not amended, some of the law firms involved in the tobacco settlement will stand to gain nearly $925 million per firm. I would say that 
is a pretty good raise for relatively little work. 
It is important that we reach a decision, that we put some limitations on it, and that we keep people from making an unusually large amount from the tax money of the lowest-paid Americans. 
That is where we are. A thousand dollars is higher than I would like it to be, but we are trying to find a range where people will say that is enough. We will have enough other people who will say that is too much. But I will go with it. We will get a vote that will place some limitation on the way we are handling tax money for the American people. 
I thank the President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, this bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by my colleagues Senators Bingaman, Kennedy, Jeffords and Hutchinson would fully bring the United States Postal Service under the regulatory umbrella of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It has always been my unshakeable belief that the Government must play by its own rules. This important legislation is an incremental step in the effort to ensure that the `law of the land' applies equally to all branches of the Government as well as the private sector --and everything in-between. 
Since I became a member of this distinguished body, I've been advocating legislation geared to improve the safety and health of our nation's workplaces. My sincere devotion to this issue, however, goes back much farther than my work here in Washington. For 12 years, I was an accountant for Dunbar Well Service in Gillette, WY, an oil well servicing company with offices throughout Wyoming. Like most businesses in my home state, Dunbar Well Service is a small business. The payroll consisted of 130 employees. As a result, I wore several hats. One of my roles was safety instruction, which required me to travel the state teaching employees about the importance of workplace safety and health. The company's rigorous safety program even had me collecting samples for drug tests--an extremely effective method of deterring workplace injuries and fatalities, by the way. 
I saw things with OSHA that I thought needed to be changed. I served in the State legislature. I was told that States can't change that and I understand that. Then I got to come to Washington, and in Washington we can make a difference in the workplace. I went to work on a SAFE Act, one that will provide safety in all businesses. That has been through hearings. It has been through markups in the Labor Committee and is ready to be debated on this floor. I have had hands-on experience in the workplace with safety, and I know that workplace safety and health is everyone's business. And that's the only way it works. It is not a political issue, it is an issue that cannot be divided by a barrier that separates even the public and the private sector. It's everybody's concern, and that is the only way it works. 
We must ensure the safety and health of all employees because they are the most important asset of any business. It's success or failure rests with their ability to provide efficient care and service to their customers, whoever they may be. Although all Federal agencies must comply with the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health statute, they are not required to pay penalties issued to them by OSHA. The bill I am introducing today is the first step in the effort to eliminate this barrier. 
It is important to point out that this legislation is not intended to single out the Postal Service. My first look at how ineffective Federal agencies are at making workplace safety and health a priority began when I noted that Yellowstone National Park was cited by OSHA last February for 600 violations--92 of them serious. One of those serious violations was the Park's failure to report an employee's death to OSHA. In fact, Yellowstone has posted five employee deaths in the past three and one-half years. Although there are these and other serious problems noted in the Park's safety and health record, I later found that it pales in comparison to the United States Postal Service's record. 
After looking at the past 5 year totals for all Federal workplace injuries, illnesses, lost work time and fatalities, I was shocked to see the Postal Service at the very top of the list. It was my initial feeling that the armed forces would be the most hazardous occupation in the Federal Government. That notion was proven wrong. Surprisingly, the Postal Service employs relatively the same number of workers as the Department of Defense. Yet it has double the number of total workplace injuries and illnesses and almost double the number of lost work-time cases as the Department of Defense. 
What is most troubling about the Postal Service's safety record, however, is its annual workers' compensation payments. From 1992 to 1997, the Postal Service paid an annual average of $505 million in workers' compensation costs--placing them once again at the top of the Federal Government's list. Moreover, the 
 Postal Service's annual contribution to workers' compensation amounts to almost one-third of the Federal program's $1.8 billion price tag. These facts are simply inexcusable and clearly justify the need for legislation. Better yet, this legislation would likely decrease the annual expenditures for workers' compensation because of a reduction in workplace injuries, illnesses, lost time and fatalities. 
In 1970, Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act, eliminating the old Postal Department status as a cabinet office. Twelve years later, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient--depending on market-driven revenues rather than taxpayer dollars. 
Of course the Postal Service is big. The Postal Service is 43 percent of the world's mail. It has annual profits that exceed $1.5 billion. If the Postal Service were a private company, it would be the 9th largest business in the United States and 29th in the entire world. It is bigger than Coca-Cola, Xerox, and Kodak combined. It has offices in virtually every community. In fact, some of the communities in my State are communities because they are a post office. So it covers the big and it covers the small. 
When I did the SAFE Act I talked to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I talked to any group that would talk to me. I talked to businesses, I talked to employers, I talked to employees, I talked to unions, and then drafted a bill. That bill is going through the process. 
When I noticed this problem, I went through the same process. I have met with those groups--agencies, unions that are involved in this process--and I have to say, I have gotten some very helpful, constructive suggestions from those groups. Those suggestions appear in the bill. 
I have talked to the Postal Service about it. They have reviewed it. They have asked for additional time to review it. The bill is only five pages long. I don't know how long it takes to review that, so I can only assume that they have no problem with the bill either, although I am sure they are not excited to come under the same rules that everyone else plays under. 
The point of this legislation is simple. If government makes the rules, Government must play by them. this is the same basic premise adopted by Congress when it passed the Congressional Accountability Act during the 104th Congress. The Postal Service is not above the law and its employees are no less 
important to its daily operations than the employees of private businesses are to the companies that employ them. When advocating workplace safety and health in this context, I can think of no better place to start than the Postal Service--which calls itself a Federal agency when it is helpful to refer to itself as such. In fact, it's not a Federal agency at all. It's a self-sufficient, quasi-governmental entity. How many Federal agency's employees can collectively bargain under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act? How many Federal agencies don't receive one dime of the taxpayers' money? How many Federal agencies post annual profits exceeding $1.5 billion? The Postal Service exhibits almost every characteristic of a private business. Still, it's reluctant to fully comply with Federal occupational safety and health law. Clearly, that must change. 
After carefully examining the perspectives of the Postal Service and the unions representing its employees, I have concluded that the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act is necessary legislation. The bill would permit OSHA to fully regulate the Postal Service the same way it does private businesses. In addition, the bill would prevent the Post Office from closing or consolidating rural post offices or services simply because it's required to comply with OSHA. Service to all areas of the Nation, rural or urban, was made a part of the Postal Service's mission by the 1970 Postal Reorganization Act. The quality of the service it provides should not decrease because of efforts to protect and ensure employee safety and health. Along this same premise, the bill would prevent the Postal Rate Commission from raising the price of stamps to help the Postal Service pay for potential OSHA fines. Rather, the Postal Service should offset the potential for OSHA fines by improving workplace conditions which would decrease its annual $500 million expenditure on workers' compensation claims. 
This bipartisan bill will make the law of the land mean what it says. Congress would only be applying those standards to the Postal Service that it applied to itself three years ago. The Postal Service has the most alarming occupational safety and health record in the Federal Government. It should therefore be the first to be reined in. 
Every schoolchild is familiar with the words on the New York Post Office that became the motto of the Postal Service, `Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds.' Add to that the million and one barriers, complaints, dogs, assaults and other obstacles our postal workers must deal with every day and it is clear that they have more than enough to deal with without having to worry about the conditions of their workplace as well. 
I urge my colleagues to support this necessary, common sense legislation to show our support for workplace safety and health everywhere throughout the country, in every business and corporation, in both private and the public sector.

Mr. ENZI. I recognize you do not have a laptop in which you can store all this vast information; you are using strictly the computer there. But I have some concerns, and I would like to know what you think on these concerns. 
When I was out in Wyoming this last weekend, one of the State Senators there brought me the question--he said, `Now during the last session of the legislature, we looked at putting a 15-cent a pack'--that is 15, not 50--`cent a pack tax on cigarettes in our State. And that would raise $8 million a year for us. And now I hear Congress talking about'--and at the time his knowledge was only on the $1.10, not the much higher $1.50; it was $1.10 a pack--`and out of the $1.10 a pack,' which of course will be levied on Wyoming just the same way the 15-cent a pack would be levied, `our State will get $6 million.' 
He is a little bit concerned about where all the revenue might be going. How could there be a miscalculation of that magnitude on the amount of funds that would be delivered by this? He has done extensive research into it. And I have to say that causes some concern for me, too--when 15 cents a pack will produce $8 million and $1.10 will only produce $6 million. 
I guess maybe you might interpret that the $1.50 increase is to bring that up to $8 million for us. But that sounds like a poor way to do business. 
Could it be that the $1.50 costs so much to collect, coming back here, so much gets held by the bureaucracy, that we are only going to get $6 million bucks out of $1.10?

Mr. ENZI. I need to ask how people would expect me to support $1.10 a pack when the State legislature looked at 15 cents a pack totally dedicated to health and turned that down. 
This one, as you mentioned, has all of these other ramifications. I know that one of the ramifications is to cut down on teen smoking. So I have addressed that in a number of trips I have made to the State. I tried to visit schools on Friday, and I am in Wyoming most of the time. I wonder how $1.10 is going to cause any concern. After all, kids will pay $50 for a pair of tennis shoes--I actually said $50 to see if people were paying attention. They will pay $150--I was in the shoe business for 28 years--$150 for a pair of tennis shoes. The parents can't afford it, but the kids can. In talking to these kids, they seemed to think that $1.10 a pack would be a deterrent for a few days until they realized how they were going to raise the other $1.10 a pack and maybe smoke one cigarette less, but probably not smoke cigarettes less. 
These kids asked me, and I want to ask you, how the price of a pack of cigarettes going up will deter smoking when the cost of marijuana is extremely high and there is no indication of it going down and there is still an increase in marijuana smoking. That is all black market. So if we think we are doing an elimination of the black market, that creates a great deal of concern to me, and apparently to you. I ask the Senator to give me some kind of an indication of whether the Senator thinks that price will make a difference.

Mr. ENZI. Let me ask another question that deals with this, particularly with the kids smoking, because we have been trying to get at this problem of kids smoking for some time now. 
I know the Senator is as distressed as I am that 3,000 kids a day are starting this life-threatening addiction. Although I wonder if you know more about where those estimates come from, because as far as I can tell, they are estimates, as is the percentage, that this will drop. We are talking about a 60-percent drop in youth smoking, and I think that is based on Larry Summers, Deputy Treasury Summers, when he said a 10-percent increase in the pack of cigarettes would produce a 7-percent reduction in the number of children who smoke. We seem to be going with the theory that if you raise it high enough, it will get to zero. That doesn't seem to equate with anything else that is happening. 
I ask the Senator if he has seen--probably not--the latest issue of the George Washington University magazine.

Mr. ENZI. The feature of this month's magazine is actually called `Smoke Signals,' and it is about the terrible rise in smoking on university campuses. Now we are above the teenage level. We are talking about a group who are more educated than other people. It would seem that they ought to know more about smoking than the others. Obviously they don't, because even though the rules of the university are increasing, the amount of smoking is also increasing. 
They have done a fairly extensive interview session with students from the university to find out what the causes are, why it is going up. It ranges from rebelliousness to all-out addiction, to a number of other things.

Mr. ENZI. I was fascinated to note that one of the people interviewed in this, one of the professors at GW is the person who founded ASH, the Action on Smoking and Health group, that I know from my days as mayor of Gillette has been very active in discouraging smoking, and their advocacy has been on antismoking ads. 
I ask the Senator if he reflects a little bit on what the effect of the antismoking ads might be. They went to ads; they went to billboards. I have a plastic sign in my office that thanks visitors for not smoking. They also had a number of very clever slogans. I am not sure whether the Senator might have heard them. Some of them were very disgusting and had people in disgusting situations that were smoking, all to curb, particularly, teen smoking. I think that has had some effect. It had some effect on members of my family. I think that it did help to cut down some of the teen smoking. 
But I would like to ask you what you think the effects on doing the antismoking would--how well those would work on particularly teenagers as opposed to, or in conjunction with--whichever way you would care to answer it--a rise in price of tobacco?

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am kind of fascinated that on our desks, every day throughout the session, we get a copy of whatever bill is being debated, even if it is the same one being debated the day before; and if we take it back to our office, another one miraculously appears the next day, in spite of the amount of paper involved with that and, as a plug for a computer, don't you think it would cut down on the amount of paper if we could utilize a computer on the floor? That is not really my question. This is a 753-page bill that is appearing on our desks. I know that you are aware that this isn't even the bill we are debating.

Mr. ENZI. The bill we are debating is the 753-page one, which miraculously appears on our desks, even though the 482-page bill, which has significant revisions in it, isn't available to us without a special request, and this appears to be the official version. But whether it is 753 pages or 482 pages, it is a great deal for us to cover, even with all of the help of our staffs. 
So I am curious as to whether the Senator feels that there is an adequate coverage of all types of tobacco done in this? We keep talking about cigarettes. When I was growing up, there was a period of time when my dad thought cigarettes were pretty high, so he rolled his own. It is kind of a western tradition. You get a little pack of Bull Durham and some cigarette papers. Today, people would probably think you were using illegal drugs if they saw you doing that. We are phrasing this in that form, anyway. People might go back to rolling their own. But they take this thin piece of paper and put a little dip in it--I watched him do this so many times, but I have not smoked--and then he put the tobacco in there and he had to lick the piece of paper and fold it over, and that thin paper would then stick, and it would have the semblance of a somewhat cruddy cigarette. I suspect that even though cigarettes are not healthy, they were probably more unhealthy. The advantage was that we saved the little canvas bag that it came in, filled it with sand, and used that as a sinker on our fishing lines in the canyon near our home and fished for trout. The tobacco bag worked well for catching trout. 
It was years later that I learned what it was probably doing to his lungs and eventually did do to him. I wonder if you feel that this adequately covers all of the types of tobacco and places an equivalent tax on them. We talk about the black market, but what we are talking about here is a shift from one type of tobacco to another to get a lower price, and even some exclusions, apparently, for small manufacturing companies. 
So is this just going to force people to `unbundle' their companies--that is one of the words we use around here--and form a whole bunch of small companies that manufacture this to avoid the tax? I watched people work loopholes on tax bills when I was the chairman of the Senate revenue committee in Wyoming. I knew when we were holding hearings that there was someone out there who, at the moment we were debating the bill, already knew the loophole and they were anxious to go out and benefit from that. They weren't going to share that with us. 
So do you feel there is going to be some kind of a shift done on this to the other kinds of tobacco as well as to the black market?

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am anxious to know and hope that the Senator from Missouri has the answer to how this 753-page bill or 482-page bill that we haven't had time to complete the review of yet--I realize the Senator may not have the answer to this and what kind of emphasis it places on the family as playing a role in reducing tobacco use. I have seen the statistics. Whether it is drugs or tobacco, the biggest influence on whether kids use them are the parents and the attitudes that the parents have to them. And the parents, even if they smoke, have a good influence on reducing teen smoking or youth smoking by saying that even though they do it, it hurts them; that it is not right, it seems to me. 
The bill that is really trying to get at the heart of the problem, and if the statistics all point to the family emphasis, the family attitude, the family direction being the way to reduce smoking, it seems like this bill ought to have something in there that strengthens the family and strengthens their role in doing this. It provides a mechanism for almost everything else in the world, including things that are not health related. So it seems to me like there ought to be something in here that says something to families, `You can make a difference. How do we get you involved?' I can't find that. I want to know if the Senator from Missouri is able to find it.

Does the Senator think that when we talked about in the Labor Committee, which I am on, the $34 million amount for the FDA and all of the things that would do, and that this bill has considerably more money in it than that for the FDA, does the Senator think that we are doing overkill, perhaps, with the FDA? Will they be able to adequately use the amount of money that we are talking about in this bill for that agency alone? It is a considerable expansion of that agency. Do you think that our agencies are set up in a manner that they can escalate the amount of spending that they are very good at, but can they escalate the amount of spending they are doing to meet these new amounts that are coming in, particularly with the FDA, which is critical to this?

Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. And I say thank you to the Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. President, I do rise to support the amendment numbered 2421 which is offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth. I am very much in support of this amendment. And part of it is as a protection to the attorneys. I know they are very sensitive to the kind of reputation they get in a lot of instances, and this is one of those `save the reputation of the lawyers' amendments. I am sure a lot of people out there are not used to making $88,000 an hour, and as a result they are probably a little upset with the attorneys who might get that in some of these tobacco cases. 
One of the things that people are seeing in this country is a new lottery. And this new lottery is one that requires you have an attorney to scratch your card for you. The tobacco situation is probably one of the new easy targets. In fact, I am predicting that the courts are soon going to be clogged with lawsuits, and part of that is because there are attorneys out there who can see this as a retirement bill as well as an easy target. It has been adjudicated, it has been worked, and it is easy to see that the tobacco companies have been hiding documents and doing a number of other things. 
Along with these remarks, I want to state I am probably one of the few who has not received any money from the tobacco lobby. I have been very concerned about these issues. I grew up in a house where both of my parents smoked, and my dad paid probably the ultimate price for that, even though he quit before he passed away. 
The amendment would only require lawyers to provide an accounting of their legal work to the Congress in relation to the legal actions that are covered by the underlying bill, including any fee arrangements entered into, and it would limit the payments of attorneys' fees to $250 an hour. That is not $250 an hour total for the firm; that is for the lawyers that are involved in this, and there may be more than one lawyer involved in it. So it isn't a complete limitation. 
I have heard some comments that this may just be the start of limiting other kinds of occupations. Perhaps it is, and perhaps it ought to be. Again, I think the people would be appalled to find out that people might make up to $88,000 an hour. And that might not even be the highest case in it. 
I do have to give some reference to the accountants who were mentioned. 
In accounting ethics, the amount that you charge cannot be based on what you find or the amount that you are working with. It is based on hours worked. We already have that kind of a limitation. 
I don't know of any other occupation where you get to find a pot of money and then, without being injured or damaged in the case, be able to share in that pot of money. Usually you have to have some separate arrangement for it, some kind of a limitation. Part of that is to discourage greed. 
What is happening with the tobacco bill is that there are some wealthy and connected trial lawyers that are lining their pockets from the settlement supposedly made on behalf of the American public. This bill would impose one of the most regressive taxes in American history with outrageous legal fees charged by insider lawyers, some of whom become billionaires as a result of their reputation for the States and class actions. 
A document here mentions that the attorney general of Mississippi, Mike Moore, got to pick the No. 1 campaign contributor, Richard Scruggs, who received $2.4 million in fees for the State's asbestos litigation. Then he got to lead the Medicaid recovery suit. 
Minnesota lawyers might want to know why Attorney General Humphrey chose Robins, Kaplan, with a 25 percent fee arrangement when Texas, Illinois, Indiana, and West Virginia all had lower percentages than that. They were the ones that had to do the harder work, the initial action. 
The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that four lawyers who helped to settle Florida's billion-dollar windfall were now demanding 25 percent of the settlement, or $1.4 billion. Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth has called that enough to choke a horse. 
In Texas, Governor Bush has filed a legal challenge to the $2.3 billion contingency fee, part of the recent Texas settlement. He did that in the interests of the taxpayers who may end up paying for that. 
This is not a defense of tobacco or the executives who run the industry. It is quite the opposite. In fact, I am getting a lot of comments from folks in my State. One lady said, `Let's see now, the tobacco companies have been abusing my body for all of these years while I have been smoking, and now you are going to punish them, and the way you are going to punish them is to tax me?' 
They are figuring that out all over this country. It isn't the companies that are going to be paying the tab. In these lawsuits, it isn't the companies that are going to be paying the tab on that either. Sometimes it is the taxpayers. 
In a lot of these lawsuits, it comes directly out of the amount of money that the individuals might have gotten. They don't have control over how much those lawsuits are going to be. If that amount of money holds for the State of Texas, those attorneys will earn $88,000 per hour for their legal representation. The American taxpayers are going to be left holding the tab for a number of outrageous fees. 
I think it is proper for us, again, in defense of the legal institution, to limit those fees so people aren't seeing these as a lottery for attorneys where everybody else gets the pain and the attorneys get the dollars. 
I ask that you support the amendment.

Mr. ENZI. I would like to raise an issue that has been brought to my attention since the Labor Committee reported this bill in October. It relates to the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program and I want to highlight the fact that recent NSF decisions may have a negative effect on this very successful program. I have worked closely on small business issues with my friend from Montana, Senator Conrad Burns, who also serves on the Small Business Committee with me. It is not my intention to hold up this legislation by offering an amendment at this time, but I want the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, to know that it is a very important issue for me. I would like to yield to Senator Burns for a minute and ask him to describe the situation.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to be in these Chambers on such a historic day. Many out there might think that I am referring to this final passage of the tax reform bill, and that is truly historic and very significant and allows the American people to be removed from the fear of their own Government. And that is significant, but it is not the most significant historical thing happening. 
Earlier today, there was a speech in here that recognized something very important that is happening. Last year, I was presiding when Senator Byrd gave his speech about mothers. Today, he spoke about mothers. On Sunday, we will be recognizing mothers. Mothers are probably the most significant historical thing that happen each and every day in this country. `Mother' has to be the world's most special word. 
I want to add to his comments and those of Senator Thomas earlier today. Of course, the person we get to know the best--or at least, probably more correctly worded, who knows us the best--is our mother. That gives them a very special place in our lives. They always set expectations for us. I will have to relate this in terms of my mother. I know it is done by mothers all over the country. I will tell you a little bit about my mother, and you can relate that to your mother and the other mothers in this country who are making a difference and raising families. 
My mom set expectations. It is one of those jobs of a mom. I remember coming home from a PTA meeting when I was in kindergarten, and they had talked about college, and from that point on she talked about `when' I went to college. They had talked about Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, so at that point she was sure I would be an engineer and go to MIT. But it is that expectation of college that sticks, and the other expectations of mom's, for me. 
She made deals for learning, for education. I remember once an encyclopedia salesman came to the house--the `Book of Knowledge'--and I got to look at all those dream pages in there on all of those topics. I kind of pleaded with her to have an encyclopedia, and she asked me, if she got the encyclopedia, if I would give up comic books. This was in about second grade. Well, I wound up with the encyclopedia, and she worked hard to make sure we could pay for that encyclopedia. I still have that outdated encyclopedia, and it still gives the same excitement, the same feelings of mystery and adventure, that it did then. 
And mothers give time. Sometimes they give it in a formal way to service organizations. My mom was a Cub Scout leader, she was my sister's Brownie and Girl Scout leader, and was very active in Sunday school and church, and just did a lot of things that involved us. But all mothers give time, and a lot of times we don't think about the time that they are giving when they are doing the things they are expected to do--organizing schedules, getting the meals together, doing the laundry, sewing a button on, putting a Band-Aid on--all those little things that we come to take for granted. That is time that mothers give--extra time that mothers give. 
They give encouragement. They dream those dreams for us, and then they help us to fulfill them. It was my mom who encouraged me to be an Eagle Scout. `Encourage' is a word for `insist,' I think. Without some insistence, sometimes we don't get quite to the place that their vision includes. And they hear about other dreams and visions for each one that we are able to accomplish, and they move us to another level of envisioning. 
Of course, moms are the chief people for traditions, too. We have oyster stew on Christmas Eve, play instruments around a Christmas tree, have chicken on Sunday. In fact, to this day it isn't Sunday unless I get fried chicken. Nights with popcorn, playing games, listening--I am old enough that we used to sit down and listen to the radio together. `Fibber McGee and Molly' was one of the most popular shows. Making sauerkraut, and canning, all of the kinds of meals that mother put together. 
Of course, the mothers are the ones who really establish that firm foundation of family. They are the ones who watch out for the parents and the grandparents and the kids and the grandkids, and think of the little events that are happening that ought to be special celebrations, and they make them special celebrations, often, by being there. 
Of course, another part that mothers play is an educational role, passing on the lessons from their moms, and often in very succinct phrases. I have in my Washington office the mission statement that we came up with by which we measure everything that is done in the office. It is a series of phrases that my mom used to use when we were growing up, just so that we knew what we were supposed to be doing. The three easy rules are: Do what is right. Do your best. Treat others as you want to be treated. Even here in the U.S. Senate, if it doesn't fit those criteria, we are not going to do it. 
Earlier today, Senator Thomas made some comments about my mom. I deeply appreciated those. My mom was selected as Wyoming's Mother of the Year this year. She is 75 years young and still involved in many things, probably most principally still involved in being a mother. I still get the regular lessons, the hopes, the expectations, the dreams. But last weekend I got to go to Atlanta to see the special celebration for the mothers of the year from each of the States in the Nation. I have to tell you, that was a very spectacular collection of women who have done some very unusual things, way beyond the call of duty. And they do that as a celebration of all mothers and the unusual things that mothers do, often without credit. 
I have to tell you that a lady named Diane Matthews was given the honor of being the Nation's Mother of the Year, and she will spend the next year traveling around at her own expense, helping out mothers' organizations across this country to deliver a message. I wish that I had the time to run through the special attributes that all of these women who were mothers of the year had. They deserve it. But, so does your mother deserve some special accolades, and that is what Sunday is going to be about, making a special day of saying, `Thanks, mom,' and maybe mentioning a few of those things that we forget to mention some of the times. 
I have to tell you a little bit about this organization that does this nationwide thing for promoting mothers, because that is what will change this country more than what we do in this body. Laws will not make the difference in the end--or in the beginning. Mothers are there at the beginning, and they start to form our lives right at that point. I have to tell you that this organization tries to improve motherhood, something that is already excellent. They know that it can be better. They know that if they work together, they can make this country better. I want to pass on to you a few of the suggestions they have for the homes of America. 
They have a pledge that mothers who join sign on to. It covers some very basic things. They recognize that there are no quick fixes to problems facing families, but they suggest: Pray each day. Establish family traditions; share history. Inspire respect, a sense of belonging, a feeling of gratitude and responsibility. They suggest a daily devotion and having a family meeting once a week. 
That is included with eating together as a family at least once a day for a chance to compare notes; play together, learn, teach and model life skills, such as time management; love and nurture family members; monitor television viewing; promote patriotism; teach values; plan and spend time with your spouse; and learn the parenting skills. 
They have some community goals: Reestablish the dignity and importance of being a mother; encourage community-wide needs assessment to identify and solve problems. They recognize that the moms can see the problems in the community, they can identify those needs and get people busy solving them. 
They suggest implementing a mentor mothers program: Get the mothers who have some experience to help those who don't have experience yet to learn what the jobs are, and that can be done in a neighborhood sort of way. 
They have a number of suggestions for the neighborhood: Create a nurturing neighborhood; community watch and safe neighborhoods; community cleanliness and beautification; recycling; emergency preparedness; gardens for the hungry; and neighborhood parties to create a sense of belonging. In this country, we have lost the sense of belonging as we get so busy and wrapped up in our jobs, and that is something to which mothers will bring us back. 
They are emphasizing family time together, mothers helping other mothers, sharing the peace and power of prayer and providing quilts for at-risk babies--they go to hospitals all over the country and give quilts to babies who might otherwise be at risk--and also showing the appreciation of the role of mothers everywhere. 
It was a tremendous adventure to attend their convention and see all of the different activities in which they are involved, things we ought to have more people involved in all over this country. 
I encourage everyone to make Mother's Day special this year. Mothers help us to have celebrations. They are cheerleaders for all of the events of our lives. Sunday is a good day to be a cheerleader for the events in their lives. Take a few moments and write down some of the fond memories of your mother and share those with your mother. It will be a pleasant experience for both of you. After all, your mother had the dreams and did the work that makes your day, today, a reality. 
In a speech I saw once, there were some lines that go something like this: For 9 long months, your mother carried you next to her heart. There is nothing that you will ever be able to do that will exceed her secret expectations of you. And even if your actions sink to the lowest depths of human behavior, you can't possibly sink beneath the love of her for you.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Workforce Investment Partnership Act, offered by Senator DeWine, Senator Jeffords and other members of the Subcommittee on Employment and Training on which I serve. I would like to take a minute here to express my reasons for supporting the bill and explain why this is a good piece of legislation. 
Our mission in this area was most clearly put before us by the General Accounting Office. In their testimony to the Senate Labor Committee they showed that our current system for delivery of job training and vocational education is broken. The 163 programs across 15 agencies result in a disjointed and uncoordinated system that is a very inefficient use of the taxpayers' money. I have said that we probably need an education program just to teach people how to figure out how to find federal job training assistance. We need to simplify the process and this bill fixes many of the problems that the GAO outlined. 
This legislation is built around the idea that we need more flexibility for state education and labor programs to work. It builds on local needs and interests, ensuring a fair partnership between business and educators. Importantly, it maintains strong program objectives while at the same time, allowing individuals to make decisions about their own training programs through a voucher system. 
The goals of the vocational education program are clear--to prepare kids for what happens after high school. Not all kids are college-bound. Not all kids should be college-bound. Those who are not, should have an opportunity to follow educational programs that are relevant to their interests. This bill gives States greater flexibility to design programs that will target the unique needs of their students. 
The goals of the job training programs are also clear--to prepare people for their jobs in a rapidly changing workplace. Business cooperation and input is critical for that. Flexibility for state and local partnerships is also important so they can tailor programs to meet local needs. This bill accomplishes that flexibility and increases local empowerment. 
My home State of Wyoming has made a lot of progress in this area. Our Governor, Jim Geringer, has taken a strong interest in developing a coordinated system of education and employment, with an emphasis on individual responsibility. Two years ago, he called for a state-wide conference on the issue. The focus was how to help Wyoming's people meet ever-changing workplace needs and how we could help not only our kids, but our adults, find and keep valuable jobs without having to leave the State. 
One of the biggest problems we identified in Wyoming was that the federal system was fragmented, had too many narrow categories of eligibility, duplicated effort and had confusing accountability requirements. The bill before us today will resolve these problems. It will improve delivery by enabling states to develop coordinated education and training programs. It gives States the program objectives, but allows them to design their own measurement systems. Most importantly, this bill lets the people in my State focus federal dollars where Wyomingites think they should go. 
One part of the bill that I strongly support are changes that have been made to the Labor Market Information system. Here we have been able to move towards a state-based data system and ensure that state needs get a priority with the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the past, the Bureau has paid little attention to state statistics agencies. This is another issue of local control where people in our states know more about what labor information is important to local needs. 
I want to take a minute to address a few of the specific concerns that have been raised about this bill. First is the difficulty raised by the National Governors Association about coordination with local workforce boards. This does not pose a problem in my state because we do not have any population centers that would qualify for separate local grants. Our State Workforce Board will serve the entire state. On this issue, however, I would say 
that it is important for State Government to be able to coordinate these activities. I also believe that local government knows best when it comes to the needs of local communities. This bill strikes a sound balance between these two efforts. 
The second concern I have heard is that `unified plans' will allow governors to transfer education money into training. Again, it is my position that local and state government is most responsive to and knowledgeable about local needs. If educators are unable to justify certain spending in the face of greater needs in training areas, then local government should be able to make that decision. That works both ways. Training advocates will have to show the importance and relative value of their programs. This bill provides a great opportunity for state and local governments in Title 5, which provides an option for unified plans. Not surprisingly, this part has caused the most difficulty for `big government' types at the Departments of Labor and Education. 
A third concern I have heard is that this bill will give the Secretary of Education increased powers over the content of state education plans. I want to point out that I am very sensitive to that question. It is one of the first tests I apply in my review of any proposal that affects K-12 education. Local and state control must be preserved. With that in mind, it is important to note that the concerns are not unfounded. 
This legislation directs the Department of Education to consult with states in developing performance measures to evaluate state programs. The measures relate to student mastery of academic and vocational skills, as well as placement and retention in education and later in job situations. States will then negotiate with the Department to determine expected levels of performance--tailored to meet State differences--but according to the index developed by the Department. The question is--Is it more intrusive than current performance requirements under the Carl Perkins Act? 
Under the Perkins law, States must submit plans that include descriptions of how they will meet certain federal objectives. But there is one big difference. Carl Perkins empowered state boards to develop the performance measures. States only had to show they were making progress according to their own defined measurements. I am very concerned about allowing the Department of Education into the development of these measurements. I do not believe the federal government is genuinely capable of setting standards for mastery of academic and vocational skills for our kids. That role belongs to elected school boards and state government--not to appointed federal officials. 
The good Senator from Missouri, Senator John Ashcroft, has expressed real concerns about this part of Title 1 of the bill. While I strongly support the majority of this legislation, I would prefer to see the performance provisions that were included in the House bill, end up in the final version. I do intend to push for the House version in conference. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that this is a good bill. As with any legislation, though, it is not perfect. There are some parts I would prefer to see removed or changed. But on the whole, this bill is a remarkable improvement over the chaotic maze of existing job training, vocational education and adult education programs. It is a step forward for local and state control of these efforts. It is a step forward in simplifying delivery of these services and making them more responsive to changing needs. And it is a step forward for personal choice and for accountability.

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the Congressional Awards Foundation recently held their third annual benefit. At that event, several award winners spoke of their dedication to this program that promotes volunteerism, personal development, physical fitness, and active community involvement by our nation's young people. 
At the benefit, one of our colleagues, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, was honored. A lifetime of public service and his own commitment to God and Country was noted by the Congressional Awards Foundation with the presentation of their 1998 Leadership Award. 
The Congressional Awards are near and dear to many a Wyomingite's heart because our state was the first to present these awards and recognize the importance of our young people's contribution to the effort to make our communities better places to live. The program has since become a great success and recognized the efforts of many special people along the way--like Senator Byrd. 
When he was presented with his Leadership Award, Senator Byrd had some important things to say about his youth, his childhood, and about those things that helped to mold him, shape him and make him what he is today. There is a great deal of food for thought there, which is why I wanted to share those remarks with my colleagues. 
I was particularly interested in his comments about heroes and about the role models we looked up to when we were youngsters. Unfortunately, as Senator Byrd notes in his speech, the kind of people we drew our inspiration from back then seem to be few and far between nowadays. 
Still, there is reason for hope. There are still those people, like Senator Byrd, who exemplify the qualities of leadership, strong personal character, and a sense of values and principles, that inspires others to greatness. These are the kinds of examples we need to provide our children. 
As Senator Byrd points out so well in his speech, `Each of us has a chance through our personal example to inspire some youngster to greatness. And that is a gift far too precious to squander.' 
It is clear from Senator Byrd's many years of public service, and especially from his service in the Senate, that he has not squandered that precious gift. There is no doubt that he has inspired many to greatness by his example.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of this bill that we have been addressing since noon, H.R. 2637, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. By passing this legislation, Congress will take an important step in reforming what many Americans believe to be the most feared agency in the United States. 
I want to congratulate Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee for the tremendous effort he made last year to begin some oversight hearings. We heard earlier today those may be the first oversight hearings in the history of the IRS, an IRS that was formed during the Civil War. 
The hearings that we heard last year were frightening, revealing, and to most of the American public, not surprising, unfortunately. We learned a lot from that process. It provided emphasis and timing to be able to do the reform bill that we are presently debating, a reform bill that will bring a little bit of a sense of security to the honest American taxpayer. 
Last year I had so much interest in the hearings that were going on that we arranged for each day's hearings to be on our web site, the web site for my office, each day. Those were available within 24 hours. We have also been taking the hearings that were just held and getting them posted on the web site so they would be accessible to every American in the United States. I think that access to that will lend more urgency to the work before the Senate today. 
The bill before the Senate today, and I appreciate the very detailed explanation that Chairman Roth gave earlier this afternoon, this bill will first overhaul the IRS organizational structure; secondly, it will provide necessary protections for American taxpayers; and third, it will require greater accountability from the IRS employees. 
I will talk about that in a little more depth. First, the IRS Reform Act will overhaul the organizational structure of the IRS. In order for any organization to perform its function well, it is necessary for it to know what that function is, to know its mission. When I was in the Wyoming State Legislature, I worked with a number of agencies as they implemented strategic plans. We passed a bill that forced each of them to say what they do and how we could tell if they got it done. I think that is key to anything in government. There is no bottom line, but there is a mission. 
I watched that process as they did it in the State. We heard from directors, from the agencies, and we heard from the employees as it got down to their level on what they do and how we could tell if they got it done. I have to say I was so pleased, there were employees that came forward and said, `My 
job shouldn't exist. It doesn't fit with what we say we are doing.' It is my earnest hope that every one of those people were promoted, not eliminated. 
It worked so well in our State that we were able to get our budget balancing process down to a record 3 weeks and then to 13 days. I was pretty excited when I got elected to come back to Washington. I thought that was one of the things that the Federal Government could do--have a mission process. But when I got back here, I was excited to find that it already existed. We have a Government Performance and Results Act. It requires every Federal agency to have a mission statement, to have goals, to define them, so that they are measurable and prioritized, and then to see that the goals match up with the budget so they are spending the money on what they said they would. 
As a result of my excitement over that act, I got copies of a number of agencies I was interested in to see what they said they were doing and how we would know if they got it done. One of those agencies was the IRS. Something else I did was to go on a field trip to those agencies and let them explain to me, through their government performance and results, what it was they thought they were doing. It was an interesting trip to the IRS. I will admit to say they were extremely cooperative and had a lot of insights they were willing to share with me on problems they have and solutions they are arriving at. 
One of the things that I asked about was when a taxpayer calls in and asks a question about their taxes, how do they know they can rely on that? I want to tell you there isn't a good answer to that. I have asked for written confirmation when that answer is given so you can put that with your tax records and then show that to the agent if you are audited. 
We talked about having error notices that are easier to read. I don't know how many people have received an error notice, but they are computer-generated letters, and the computer-generated letter generates a series of codes that might be the reason you are being audited. You can take those series of codes and you can look in an extremely long document that comes with the letter and see what the range of possibilities are on what may have been done wrong and what is not right. It is computer generated. The computer is spewing out a series of letters. It could at least transform those letters into the exact words from the text of what those possibilities are. We are suggesting they ought to tell you what the problem is that brought you up for an audit. 
There are also problems with dollar thresholds. I remember when one of my clients--and I am the only accountant in the U.S. Senate--one of my clients, on a $3 million report, was told they were off by 58 cents. It took 3 months and about nine letters to get that straightened out. I suggest that when the IRS sent that very first letter they had already used as much money as they had the possibility of correcting--58 cents. It turned out they had made a mistake in their addition--58 cents. 
Then there is the problem of random audits. The IRS has been randomly auditing people in extreme detail. No reason showed up for the need for the audit. It was to get an estimate of how many dollars they might be missing. Those people were required to produce more documents than if they had been chosen for an audit. They had to find the documents for every single line of their audit. What would it achieve? It would give us a better state of how much money is not being collected. It wouldn't collect a dime. We have asked for that process to be stopped, and we have been told it is, but you will hear numbers still brought out about the possibility that we are doing random audits. 
I congratulate the new Commissioner. The new Commissioner brings a management perspective instead of a tax perspective to an agency that needs some management perspective. He has already changed some of the phone overflow so that people who may not have as heavy a work load can be answering questions. He is looking at a lot of things that need to be done. 
I have to admit that Congress has a big task ahead of it because part of the problem is the Tax Code itself. It is too cumbersome, too hard to understand, too many provisions, too many exceptions, too many interpretations. 
So it is up to Congress to take a look at the Tax Code and the American taxpayers to demand that we take a look at that Tax Code. We have to decide if it is going to be a Tax Code of policy or just one of collecting money. So far, we say it is a tax policy. But we really haven't taken the step of sitting down and determining tax policy and what we are trying to achieve. We always jump to the solution without agreement on the problem. I think the voters would buy and be excited over a clearly defined problem. They would hope for a solution. 
We talk about the American dream. We talk about strong families. We talk about home ownership. We talk about health care for everyone. We talk about the need and importance for investment and savings. We take about the role that small business plays as the backbone of our economy and the economic hope and dream for individuals across this country. In the land of freedom, we hide taxes. And it gets worse. We double tax some people. I ask you, with the exception of home ownership, where are those things reflected in the Tax Code? 
Stronger families? No, we penalize marriage. We discourage parents from raising their own children. We only give big corporations a health care tax break. We don't even give the same break to individuals paying their portion of health care. We tax investment and interest and at an escalated rate, unearned income. Our current tax system discourages the small, the beginning businesses, particularly those beginning in the home, which brings us back to families. America has become the home of the `tax trap,' and the IRS gets to spring it. Let's see, the way the tax trap works is, the harder you work, the more taxes you pay. The more taxes you have to pay, the longer and harder you have to work. You end up with more work, and Washington ends up with more money. I don't think that is how our forefathers saw the system happening. 
We in Congress have to make filing easier, and that means less forms, that means less instructions, that means less chance of making a mistake, and that means less chance of an audit. 
When I was at the IRS on the field trip, I asked about paperwork simplification--a major effort by the Federal Government. We have to reduce the amount of paperwork Americans have to do. Well, I want to tell you how they told me how that is rated. The IRS generates more paperwork than the other agencies combined; 75 percent of all Government paperwork comes through the IRS. 
We had some suggestions for ways the tax forms could be a little easier to fill out. A couple of those required adding another line so that you knew how the number got from here to here. Can't do that. The way the Paperwork Reduction Act works is, to get any credit under paperwork reduction, you have to remove lines from the tax forms or any other Government form, regardless of whether that makes it more difficult or not. That will give you a little explanation why the EZ-1040 form--the simplest form we are supposed to fill out--has a 33-page instruction manual. You have to be a lawyer to read the detail to figure out what to put on this `simplified' tax form. That is not right. But that is why we have it. 
The Paperwork Reduction Act only gives credit for taking lines off the form, not for building millions of pages of explanation for the lines that you do not understand. I thought of an `Enzi Form 1040,' a 1-page form. It would still provide the auditing capability that the IRS would need. It can be done if we go to tax policy and if we get together and work on 
simplification. 
Now, the IRS reform bill makes some important structural changes, which I believe will help to focus the agency's mission. This legislation creates a separate board to oversee the management and operations of the IRS. This board would include six private life experts, who will bring their collective private sector experience to such tasks as reviewing and approving the agency's strategic plans and budget requests. The board would also have big picture authority over IRS enforcement and collection activities. Board members would not, however, be permitted to intervene in particular tax disputes. Moreover, in order to ensure the agency's autonomy from improper influence, these board members would be governed by conflict of interest restrictions. I believe this new board, which will be comprised largely of people with experience in the private sector, will help the agency better meet the needs and concerns of the agency's customers--the American taxpayer. 
Secondly, the IRS reform legislation provides important safeguards for the American taxpayers. For too long, the IRS has actively filled the roles of judge, jury, and executioner in collection actions against taxpayers. This Reform Act would shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in most court proceedings, as long as the taxpayer introduces credible evidence relevant to determining his or her income tax liability. It would also place the burden of proof on the IRS in determining whether penalties should be imposed. The bill expands a taxpayer's ability to collect attorney fees when the IRS brings unwarranted action against them and allows taxpayers to recover civil damages when an IRS employee is negligent in collection actions. Taxpayers may also recover attorney fees in civil actions against the IRS when the IRS engages in unauthorized browsing or disclosure of taxpayer information. It would also provide substantial relief for innocent spouses in collection actions based on past joint returns by allowing spouses to be liable only for tax attributable to their income. 
Many of the taxpayer provisions in the IRS Reform Act are a direct result of the abuses uncovered last year by the Senate Finance Committee hearings. Many people were shocked to learn that a number of the due process protections Americans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not apply to actions involving the IRS. The bill corrects many of these injustices. Once this bill becomes law, the IRS will be required to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days before the Service files a notice of a Federal tax lien. A taxpayer would then have 30 days to request a hearing by IRS appeals. No collection activity would be allowed until after the hearing. The taxpayer would likewise be able to petition the Tax Court to contest the appeals decision. Finally, the communications privilege now granted only to attorneys would be extended to accountants and other tax practitioners. This charge would provide taxpayers with the necessary confidentiality in communications with their tax preparers, whether or not they are licensed attorneys. 
I hope this reform activity will spread to some of the other agencies. We have people across America who are living in fear of the Government that they vote for, that they pay for, that is supposed to be working for them--people who really want to do the right thing, but are afraid to ask the right questions for fear that question will be used to penalize them, for fear that question will put them in the public spotlight and embarrass them. It isn't just the IRS; the Environmental Protection Agency is one that a number of small businesses live in fear of asking a question about: Is it pollution? How do I stop it? Can I clean it up and spend the money myself and not be penalized? 
OSHA is another one of those, where the small businessman lives in fear of asking the right question for fear it will result in a penalty and not an answer. Sometimes they are not even allowed to give an answer, but they are allowed to penalize. 
So what we are talking about in this bill is allowing the taxpayer to ask his accountant the right question to see if that is what he really owes and not have that become a road map for the IRS for future action. I believe these changes will help rein in many of the intimidation tactics used to target the unsuspecting taxpayers. 
Thirdly, and lastly, the IRS reform bill will bring and demand greater accountability from the more than 100,000 employees who work for the Internal Revenue Service. 
It requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, phone number, and address of the IRS employee whom the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. Imagine that--being able to talk to the person that knows the problem. Moreover, this bill requires the IRS to maintain complaints of any employee misconduct on an individual employee basis. This won't be just the IRS. Each person will have accountability. It will prohibit the IRS from labeling individual taxpayers as `illegal tax protesters' and maintaining lists of these individuals. The IRS will also have to disclose to taxpayers in simple terms the criteria and procedures for selecting taxpayers for audit. I believe this will decrease the ability of the IRS to target innocent taxpayers and innocent small businesses for audit. 
Mr. President, the IRS Reform Act will go a long way in reforming our Government's tax collection practices. By returning customer services and accountability to the IRS, this legislation helps ensure that the American taxpayers are treated with the decency and respect they deserve. 
Again, I want to thank the chairman for the hearings that he held to lend emphasis to the need for this bill and the desire to have this bill. 
I appreciate the bipartisan effort that has been made to get this bill moving through the process this week and look forward to the debate that we will have on it. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. I thank my senior Senator. It is kind of Wyoming day, talking about the need for IRS reform. 
I do rise this morning in support of H.R. 2676, which is the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 that was passed by the House. 
That document, of course, has been taken by the Senate and improved based on the hearings that were held last year and are currently going on here. 
By passing legislation to reform the IRS, Congress will take an important step in reforming what many Americans believe to be the most feared agency in the United States. This bill will overhaul the IRS organizational structure. It will provide necessary protections for American taxpayers, and it will require greater accountability for our employees, the IRS employees. There has been tremendous support in this body for making a change. We talked about it at the end of last year when we were appalled at the hearings that were going on at that time. I hope people are tuning into the hearings that are going on now to see the real-life examples of what can happen with a bureaucracy out of control. 
For any who are interested in the details of the hearings, I have a web site, as do many of the Senators. That web site the day after the hearings posts the testimony from those hearings. We are keeping careful track of it. There are a number of documents that people would be interested in reading that have some summaries of it. I have one in my hand called `The Lowlights of Today's IRS Testimony,' that even talks about a manager being pulled at gunpoint from a shower by the IRS. I know that the American public is keeping up on this. I know my colleagues are keeping up on this. I am convinced that there will be something significant done to get the IRS under control. 
The IRS Reform Act will overhaul the organizational structure of the IRS. In order for any organization to perform its function well, it is necessary for it to know its mission. When I was in the Wyoming State Legislature, we passed an act that forced strategic planning by all of the agencies, one of the most valuable things we have done. We forced them to say what it was they were trying to do. And then we asked them how can we tell if you get it done? 
That process was so valuable that in a 3-week period we changed our budgeting process to a balanced budget, a new record for the State of Wyoming. I was so excited about what happened there that I talked about having that happen in Washington. I have to tell you that I was delighted when I got here when I found out that Congress had already passed a Government Performance and Results Act. That is an act which says to all of the agencies tell us what you do and tell us how we can tell if you got it done--measurable goals, prioritized goals, goals that are reflected in a budget for the agency so that what they say they are doing is really what they are spending their money on. 
I didn't feel there was a lot of emphasis on this new program, and a lot of dissension by the agencies, so I did some field trips just after the first of the year. I went to a number of the agencies that had these Government performance and results plans, and asked some more questions just to emphasize a little bit whether they really understood what it was we were trying to get at, the question of how do we know if you got it done? 
One of the agencies that I went to was the Internal Revenue Service. I don't think there is even the beginning of the numbers to be able to tell what they have done so they can tell if they are getting better. Quite frankly, from the testimony that we have heard, we don't want them getting better. 
We talked a little bit about the telephone conversations that they have. This is not as drastic stuff as was covered in the hearings. This is some normal stuff that people run into when they are trying to get answers from the IRS. You call them up. A guy answers the phone on the other end and he tells you the answer to your question. You use that information and you have no backup for it, so if somebody later says that it is wrong, you are hung out to dry. It is your problem. 
I suggested maybe there ought to be written confirmations sent when they give us an opinion, something that we can attach to our tax document and save until that horrible day of an audit. And then we can say, `No, no, the IRS agent told me this. This is the data I relied on to file my taxes.' 
We talked about error notices. I don't know how many people have gotten error notices, but if you do, you get this computer-generated form that says: You have the following problem. And then a series of codes. And you can take another document that is multiple pages and look at it and figure out, perhaps, from that code, what you may or may not have done wrong. 
What a way to run a business. We have computers. This thing is computer generated. The computer could look up the actual reason if it was keyed in there and list explicitly what they thought you had done wrong so you would have ample notice of what the potential problem was, instead of that fear of being a criminal, for the days that you wait until you meet the IRS person, who then asks you a series of irrelevant questions that you could have had exact answers for, could have maybe even submitted them by mail. 
Then there is the problem of dollar thresholds. I had one client who had a 58-cent difference on $2 million worth of reporting and it took 3 months and 10 letters to clear up that discrepancy. I don't know how much the IRS expected to make off of a 58-cent error, but I can tell you that their postage on the first letter almost cost them more than what they were trying to correct. Not very good management. 
We talked about random audits that the Senator from Georgia addressed earlier. They also assured me they were not doing random audits but had this terrible conflict because they cannot tell without random audits how much money they are not collecting. They want to be able to go into people's documents, who they have absolutely no reason to suspect of any errors at all, and review absolutely every detail of their documents and force them to get detailed documents to back up things that we never require detailed documents for when you are filing your tax return. They wanted to look through absolutely everything of your personal life to see if maybe you didn't file something so they can see what the estimated error is of taxes not 
collected. That is an abomination. Why do we want to know exactly how much, within a few pennies, people did not pay? Their job is to collect the money that was not paid, finding the biggest offenders first. That is a very specific task that auditors do regularly. Auditors figure out who the potential worst people are, and that is from a very prescribed set of criteria that give them indications that somebody may have made errors on their taxes. Most of the time those would prove to not be true, because sometimes people really do have unusual expenditures. They really do have unusual business expenses. But when they do, they have to answer to the IRS. That is a legitimate audit. But not a random one, going through documents and details that nobody ever anticipated needing to dredge up or being required to get in advance. 
I have to say I think the new Commissioner brings a management perspective instead of a tax perspective, instead of an `audit the people' aspect, and I look forward to changes that will be made on that basis. 
I also asked the IRS if they were doing anything to suggest simplification of the Tax Code. This was a huge revelation to me. We have a Paperwork Reduction Act in the United States. It says that every Government agency is supposed to be figuring out how to reduce the paperwork that you have to do--reduce the paperwork. I even checked to see who generates the most paperwork. It was no surprise. Seventy-five percent of all paperwork for Government agencies is taxes. You know that if you fill out your forms. There are huge numbers of taxes. 
We had a couple of suggestions for ways that we thought there might be just an additional little explanation right on the tax form, so people would understand what they were filling out. Better there, instead of going through pages of documents. The EZ-1040 form has a 33-page instruction manual, and you still have to be an accountant to understand that instruction manual. 
I thought maybe just a couple of little additions right there on the page would help people to get the answer and to get it right and to get it easier. That is where the big revelation comes in. The Paperwork Reduction Act is based solely on numbers of lines that are removed from documents. That is what you get your credit for and that is all you get credit for. So there is no incentive whatsoever to make a form more understandable if it increases the number of lines by even one, not a bit of incentive. In fact, there is a disincentive to do that. That is why you find the huge documents explaining the taxes that accompany what are considered to be relatively simple forms. There is a lot of room for improvement there yet. 
I am not putting all the blame on the IRS on this. There is a difficulty with the tax structure and it is up to Congress to get that tax structure changed. It needs to be easier. It needs to be fairer. 
Our taxes right now are based on kind of a policy. It is a policy that gets put together as another person explains a policy to us. We have to decide whether we are going to go with policy or just collecting money. Just collecting money is a lot easier. I suggest, if we are going to have a tax policy, we ought to really have a tax policy and sit down and have that debate and talk about whether we are trying to promote the American dream and have strong families and have home ownership and encourage investment and savings and encourage small business. And we can do that through a Tax Code. And I really think we can do that through a Tax Code and make the Tax Code simple. And we have to do that. 
Right now we talk about stronger families and then we penalize marriages; we discourage parents from raising their own children; and we only give big business a health care tax break. We put the American people in a tax trap. You have to work longer and harder to pay your taxes, and if you work longer and harder, you have more taxes you have to pay. We do have to find a way to make filing easier, and that means fewer forms, that means fewer instructions, that means less chance for making a mistake, and that has to mean less chance for an audit. 
If you are audited, we have to have the IRS under control so that the taxpayer is the person who is in control, not the one who feels like they are going to jail. 
The IRS reform bill makes some important structural changes, which, I believe, will help to focus the agency's mission. This legislation creates a separate board to oversee the management and operations of the IRS. 
This board will include six `private life' experts who will bring their collective private-sector experience to such tasks as reviewing and approving the agency's strategic plans and budget requests to make sure everything matches up. The board will also have `big picture' authority over IRS enforcement and collection activities. Board members would not, however, be permitted to intervene in particular tax disputes. Moreover, in order to ensure the agency's autonomy from improper influence, these board members would be governed by conflict of interest restrictions. I believe this new board, which will be comprised largely of people with experience in the private sector, will help the agency meet better the needs and the concerns of the agency's customers--America's taxpayers. 
The IRS reform legislation provides important safeguards for American taxpayers. For too long, the IRS has filled the roles of judge, jury and executioner in collection actions against taxpayers. This Reform Act would shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in most court proceedings as long as the taxpayer introduces credible evidence relevant to determining his or her income tax liability. 
It would also place the burden of proof on the IRS in determining whether penalties should be imposed. The bill expands the taxpayer's ability to collect attorney's fees when the IRS brings unwarranted actions against them and allows taxpayers to recover civil damages from an IRS employee if he is negligent in the collection actions. 
Taxpayers may also recover attorney's fees in civil actions against the IRS when the IRS engages in unauthorized browsing or disclosure of taxpayer information. It would also provide substantial relief for innocent spouses in collection actions based on past joint returns by allowing the spouses to be liable only for tax attributable to their income. No one should be liable for taxes they couldn't possibly know about. 
Many of the taxpayer protection provisions in the Reform Act are a direct result of the abuses uncovered last year by the Senate Finance Committee hearings. Many people were shocked to learn that a number of the due-process protections Americans take for granted in other legal proceedings do not apply to actions involving the IRS. This bill corrects many of those injustices. 
Once this bill becomes law, the IRS will be required to provide notice to taxpayers 30 days before the Service files a notice of Federal tax lien. A taxpayer would then have 30 days to request a hearing from the IRS appeals. No collection activity would be allowed until after the hearing. The taxpayer would likewise be able to petition the Tax Court to contest the appeals decision. 
Finally, the communications privilege now granted only to attorneys would be extended to accountants. That means you could ask your accountant a question about your taxes, and when he gave that answer, you could rely on it not being passed directly on to the IRS. He would be in your corner for sure. It needs to be that way. We have to change some other agencies, 
too. People are afraid to ask the EPA about potential pollution problems because they don't want to be fined. They just want to stop the problem and correct it if there really is one. But we have this Government fear of asking a question for fear that it will come down on us with penalties and unusual actions by a Government agency. The same thing happens with OSHA. If there is a safety problem, you don't want to ask OSHA for sure, because it might just result in penalties, not even an answer. That is the problem we have with Government. 
This would make the questions that you ask your accountant your questions and your information, and you could feel secure that it would not be the subject of the penalties by the IRS. This change would provide taxpayers with the necessary confidentiality and communications with their tax preparers whether or not they are licensed attorneys. I believe these changes will help rein in many of the intimidation tactics used to target unsuspecting taxpayers. 
Lastly, the IRS reform bill will demand greater accountability from the 100,000 employees who work for IRS. It requires all IRS notices and correspondence to include the name, the phone number, and address of the IRS employee whom the taxpayer should contact regarding the notice. Moreover, this bill requires the IRS to maintain complaints of any employee misconduct on an individual employee basis. Individuals will be responsible for their own actions. It won't just be passed off as an IRS problem. It will prohibit the IRS from labeling individual taxpayers as `illegal tax protesters' and maintaining lists of these individuals. 
The IRS will also have to disclose to taxpayers in simple terms the criteria and procedures for selecting the taxpayer for audit. I believe this will decrease the ability of the IRS to target innocent taxpayers and small businesses for audits. 
Mr. President, the IRS Reform Act will go a long way in reforming our Government's tax collection practices. By returning customer service and accountability to the IRS, this legislation helps ensure that the American taxpayers will be treated with the decency and respect they deserve. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the IRS Restructuring Reform Act. I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. I have just returned from a very enjoyable time of traveling around Wyoming, attending town meetings, going to school classrooms, pounding a little bit on a Habitat for Humanity house. 
When I left Wyoming, it was snowing. But the folks in Wyoming understand that if there hadn't been a little bit of global warming, we would be under about 300 feet of ice. So they may not be as concerned as perhaps some other places in the world, but I want to talk today a little bit about the global warming treaty as well. I went to the treaty conference in Kyoto. I went with Senator Hagel and a couple of other Senators. The purpose of our trip was to convey the importance of the Byrd-Hagel resolution. 
We went over there to talk about a resolution that passed this Senate 95-0. That is a pretty clear message, and it was also a very simple message. The developing nations have to participate in the treaty and the treaty cannot result in serious harm to the U.S. economy. I have to say the treaty fails. It is unfair. The benefits are unclear. The costs are unknown, and the administration is unresponsive to our requests for information. 
Kyoto was titled `a global warming' conference, but I have to say it was an economic conference disguised as an environmental conference. While we were over there, we got to meet with the Chinese delegation. The Chinese, by the year 2010, will be the world's largest polluter, unquestionably. We wanted to know what they intended to do about that. They said nothing, they are a developing nation. We asked them what their definition was of a `developing nation' so that we would know when they would no longer be a developing nation. They said, `We will always be a developing nation.' We asked them if they would do voluntary restraints on their pollution. 
They said no. We asked, How about voluntary restraints at some future unspecified date? I don't know how you can make any negotiation looser than that. Their answer was no. 
We also got to hear from some of the island nations that are refusing to be a part of any voluntary restraints. Island nations. We are talking about nations that, if global warming is true, the polar icecap will melt and their island will be inundated with water; they will disappear as a country. They said they would not be a part of it, that they were a developing nation and they didn't need to do it. To me, that is the best evidence that there isn't global warming. 
There is no consensus on global warming. Some scientists argue that the carbon dioxide in global warming is even good. The important thing is that we are already doing more than others. We are doing more without recognition. We are doing more without penalties. We are doing more because it is the right thing to do. But this was an economic conference disguised as an environmental conference. It was a conference where we lose. 
I remember an incident in the Northwest, near my home up in Washington, where we got concerned about the spotted owl, that it was headed for certain extinction. We halted the Northwest logging industry. We put an entire industry and its employees out of work. Our national forests were left unmanaged, and they are now a big tinderbox; they burn whenever lightning strikes. It is not very good stewardship when we are wasting what we have. After all this, we have discovered that this timid little bird has been building nests in billboards by the highways and they are undisturbed by the passing cars and trucks. 
A part of our economy moved to other countries where they don't have the environmental laws. Logging moved to Siberia. Russian loggers are tearing down 10 million acres of forest each year. In our effort to save the spotted owl, we have wiped out the Siberian tiger. We have to be careful with the consequences of what we are promoting. 
The Vice President believes we can get rid of coal and use clean energy, like wind. I have to tell you, there are few places that are windier than the little belt that goes across southern Wyoming. It is up in the high plains, where the wind doesn't have any trees to block it. We have tried some wind experiments there. They built a generator, only to have the wind velocity blow the rotors off. I asked the environmentalists, what about wind energy, what is the potential for that? It only makes up one-third of 1 percent of our country's energy use at the present time. Their response was that it will kill the bald eagles; the eagles will fly into the generators and get chopped up. Not a good solution. I asked about water. Well, water changes the nature of the fish that use it, if we use it for hydraulic power. Nuclear power--we don't even have to talk about nuclear power and the problems supposed to be caused by it and the way that we haven't met our energy requirements for the storage of nuclear waste. 
The biggest thing that disturbed me about the Kyoto trip was that we went there without the data we requested. Before we went to Kyoto, we made it clear that there was information which we were certain any good negotiators would be gathering to use for their case. We still haven't gotten that. When we went over there, we talked about a 1990 date and maintaining the levels that we had in 1990. Our negotiators allowed the other countries to relax the criteria they had already agreed to while 
we made ours more difficult. Marvelous negotiating. They never did answer the questions about the kind of administration that would be necessary, the kind of bureaucracy that we build internationally, what kind of regulations, and to whom the United States would be subject. We didn't talk about the pollution topic, and that is going to be involved. 
I do remember, from some of the discussion of the Chinese, that they had a solution for penalties. There ought to be penalties for those developing nations that could not meet their criteria, and their idea was that the penalties then would be distributed to those developing nations on the basis of population. Now, there is negotiation. 
Numbers. We still don't have numbers. I put in an amendment last year on the foreign operations spending bill. It asked for the numbers that the administration has been collecting on global warming: How many American jobs would be lost with the treaty? How much will it cost the taxpayers to pay for Federal programs? What Federal programs will be needed? We haven't received an answer. Apparently, none of the agencies involved can say how much they are going to spend on climate change. 
This lack of accountability is a disgrace. The taxpayers should be outraged. Maybe we ought to sic some of those IRS auditors on the Office of Management and Budget until we get the numbers we asked for a year ago. Nobody knows exactly how much will be needed, where it is going, or what the purpose of it will be. Now, according to the numbers I am reading, that ought to be about a $6 billion to $10 billion violation of the Government Performance and Results Act. 
Yes, we have a law that says that the Government agencies are supposed to tell us what they are doing. Here is the important part. They are supposed to tell us how we can tell if it is getting done. And then it is supposed to be reflected in their budgets so that we can see that what they said they were going to do will get done within the constraints of the money that is there. Somewhere the numbers have to be available for what global warming--no, for what the administration's proposal of anti-economic development will cost us. 
It is time for the administration to tell us exactly how much, how it is going to be done, if there will be incentives or just penalties, how will it administer it and give a little bit of credit to those that are already working the problem without the international treaty. Americans have a right to know where their tax dollars are going. This last week, the American people spent their tax dollars, sent their tax dollars, will be audited on their tax dollars. It is time that we audit the Federal Government on the use of those tax dollars and hold them to the 95-0 treaty that protects American jobs, and make sure that if we say we are going to do a job, we are able to do the job. We owe it to the American people. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as we are heading out on the Easter recess, I want to wish all my colleagues godspeed and also make a small request of them while they are in their home States. That request is for them to thank the people that smoke for their contribution of $368.5 billion, or perhaps $510 billion. I think a lot of people out there think we are finally going to get to the big bad tobacco companies and get them to pay some money up front here and kick in for all the damage that has been done. But, really, the smokers are going to wind up paying this. I don't know whether it will be for increased tobacco costs, or whether it will be for an increased tobacco tax. At any rate, it is going to range from 50 cents to $1.10 or $1.50, or whatever they think will make a difference. 
Having said that, I ought to mention that I had not accepted any money from the tobacco companies during my campaign. It could have been very critical, as I had a highly underfunded campaign. I was offered money from the tobacco companies, but I would not accept it. I could see this sort of debate and discussion coming up later. I didn't want to be seen as favoring the tobacco companies and will not be favoring the tobacco companies. 
I have a lot of concerns, as we have gotten into this tobacco debate. In fact, the concerns have gotten to be so many that I am kind of depressed about whether or not there is any capability to do anything about the problem. When I was growing up, my folks smoked. Both my mom and my dad smoked, and they smoked a lot. In fact, I had the feeling that I didn't smoke because I could walk anywhere in the house, inhale, and get plenty of smoke. About the time I was a junior in high school, though, my dad saw a program on television. As part of this program, some kids visited a lab and they had a beaker about 6 inches in diameter and about a foot tall, half filled with some liquid. That was the amount of tar that the average smoker would have collected in their lungs. One of the kids reached into this beaker and pulled his fingers back up out of there and had strands of sticky tar hanging from it. At that point, my dad quit smoking. 
He and Mom had talked about smoking for as long as I could remember and about all of the money they would save if they quit smoking. But they had not quit--well, they quit several times, but they had taken it back up again. My mom had always said that if my dad would quit smoking, she would quit. My dad saw the picture of the stringy tar coming out of the beaker, thought about his lungs, and quit. It wasn't easy, but he quit. After a couple of weeks of my dad having quit, my mom decided that she had to quit, too; that was part of the deal. 
About a year later, I went for my annual athletic physical, and the doctor asked me to sit in his office for a minute because he wanted to talk to me, and I did; you always do what the doctor says. When he came in, he said, `I am really glad to see that you quit smoking.' I said, `I have never smoked.' He said, `Oh, yes, you have, take a look at these x-rays.' He put up the x-ray of a year before and showed me how clogged my lungs were the year before. So for years I have known about secondary smoke. We didn't even know to call it `secondary smoke' problems at that time. But they were there. It was evident on the x-rays. I also had a problem as I was growing up with hay fever. It wasn't seasonal, but I thought it had to do with molds, grass, and that sort of thing. Another benefit I had of my folks quitting smoking was that I got over hay fever. Secondary smoke again. 
About a year and a half ago, my mom had a heart attack. We found out at that time that she might still be smoking. It is a powerful addiction. So I do have some interest in smoking. I went to the George Washington University here in Washington, DC, when I went to college, and there used to be a medical museum on the mall right by the Smithsonian. It has been replaced by the Air and Space displays there. 
I think it still exists somewhere in the District. But one of the displays they had in there was parts of the human body cut up in thin slices, encased in plastic, and you could kind of page your way through a liver or a heart or lungs. They had lungs of smokers and nonsmokers. So there is a problem there, and it has been recognized for a long time. I do not think there is anybody now who argues that cigarettes will not kill you if you use enough of them long enough. It will have an effect on your health. I am very disturbed that there are still young people who are starting to smoke. They know what the damage is, they know what the outcome is going to be, and they still smoke. 
On behalf of all of these folks, we are going to look at a settlement. We are going to try to figure out whether we have the right to settle on behalf of the whole country and, if we do, in what categories we have that right to settle and what kind of a precedent we will be setting in all kinds of other fields where people may be damaged by things that at one point in time we did not know might damage them but now might clearly know that, because this will be precedent setting. 
The biggest thing I wish to talk about today is the smokers themselves, because I know as I travel around Wyoming--and I am in Wyoming almost every weekend; it is a big State with a lot of small towns, so it takes a lot of travel, and we get around regularly and talk to folks. But I know from talking to the smokers, it has not hit home yet that the smokers will pay the bill. Whether it is an increased tax or increased prices of cigarettes, the companies will collect it, the companies will forward it to us, but the smokers will pay the tab. 
Something that is happening back here that is disturbing me a little bit is, we have run into this $368.5 billion; that is a number that has been quoted for a long time. I noticed the tobacco settlement that came out of the Commerce Committee calls for about $510 billion. It doesn't matter which of those figures you want to use; they are both huge numbers. They are both probably too small a number to solve what we are talking about solving. But we are not necessarily talking about using that money to solve the problems of smoking, we are talking about it as a new addiction. That is what I call the political addiction --if there is some money and it is not earmarked, it is an addiction. 
I saw a cartoon. The cartoon essentially said: Don't give alcohol to an alcoholic; don't give drugs to a drug addict; and don't give money to a politician. 
This is more money than we have looked at in quite some time. There have always been constraints on the money we have had before. But this is pretty wide open. Oh, sure, we have said there are some things we would do with it. In fact, it was the States that brought up this issue originally. The States started some lawsuits against the tobacco companies, and they won. So now they have some money coming, and the tobacco companies can see that this could catch on, and it has. It has been to a number of States now. So the tobacco companies have said, let's get together and talk about a settlement; let's see how we can rein in a little bit of this and do some damage control. Of course, they are looking at damage control primarily for their companies, so they have reached some agreements with folks. It is a varied group of folks. 
Again, I do not know if they have the right to do the kinds of negotiations they say they are doing, but any way that you 
look at it, it is the States that started, the States that got agreements partly through the courts, now partly through negotiations and a settlement, and it seems to me that those States expect that they are going to get some money to reimburse themselves for the Medicaid they have spent to take care of smokers. 
That is what the lawsuit was about. That is the basis on which they won. So probably we ought to think about a little bit of that money getting back to the States to do what we said would be done based on the lawsuits and the settlement that came out of them. 
Now, 57 percent of Medicaid is the Federal part of the cost. So do we just have the States collect their share? How much of the $368 billion or $510 billion ought to be ours? Well, that is something we ought to legitimately address. But I am concerned that there is not money in that settlement that deals with the cost of Medicare. Smokers are going to have bigger problems when they get into Medicare than nonsmokers. It works that way with insurance; it works that way with Medicare. There isn't any money talked about in the settlement. 
We have talked about taking the Federal portion of the money from tobacco and putting that into Medicare. Good idea. Part of it comes, though, from reimbursing Medicaid, the Federal portion, the 57 percent. So we ought to take some money and put it into Medicaid probably. But we are talking about taking it--and this is for ease of talking about how we are going to handle it. The Medicare system is in trouble partly because of smoking. We are going to take a portion, that portion that turns out to be the Federal portion, and put it into Medicare. Good idea. Good plan. 
Medicare ought to have an additional contribution based on how much of it is caused by smoking--something that has been known by the companies for a long time that they have been causing, something they didn't own up to completely, something they are now talking about. So we need to be sure there is some Medicare money in there. 
Now, one of the fascinating phases I have talked about in dealing with the Medicare thing is a comment by some of the tobacco companies that it really should not be a very big part of their expense, because most smokers do not live long enough to be a part of the Medicare problem. I do not know if that is justification or not. It does not seem to me that it would be. 
We are also talking about using some of the money to compensate the people who are growing the tobacco, and there probably is some obligation on our part--not necessarily out of the $368.5 billion--to compensate the growers. The growers probably have seen the damage that smoking has been causing over the years and have had some options on other things they could have done with their land, and so a total compensation for losses probably is not in order. 
There are vending machine owners, and they are small businessmen, and I think in the settlement we are talking about compensating them, compensating them even for future loss of revenues. I am an advocate of the small businessman. I have been a small businessman. I know what some of those problems are. But I cannot go along with compensating them both for the loss of the vending machine and the loss of their future revenues. That is the normal course of doing business--figuring out what the future is going to be, what changes there are going to be in the marketplace and how you will adjust. These changes are not coming on that suddenly that they have to be compensated for future loss of revenues. 
I am even interested, as the only accountant in the Senate, in how they are coming up with the cost of the vending machines. It seems to me it ought to be the cost of the vending machines less what they have been allowed to depreciate under the tax system. 
I suggest there ought to be another part to this, and that other part I call smokers' compensation. Since the smokers of this country are going to be paying the bill, at least a portion of the money that we are going to collect, whichever method we use, ought to go for some kind of a fund that is going to solve the future health problems of these folks who are paying the bill. They ought to have some individual responsibility. It is a decision they made on their own to smoke, it is something they have known about for a long time as causing their own problems, but we are about to have one of the biggest court gluts that we have ever seen. The tobacco settlement bill as it came out of the Commerce Committee, as I understand it, has some form of immunity in it. That is a cap for the tobacco companies, guaranteeing them they will not be sued for more than $6.5 billion a year. 
That's liability protection. That means it still goes through the normal system of lawsuits. Somebody has to sue the tobacco companies to get compensation. They still have to win in court. But the companies will not lose more than $6.5 billion in any way. 
What we are going to have is thousands of lawsuits piled up in the courts, lawsuits of people trying to get to be first to the money so their money will come within the $6.5 billion cap. It sounds like a lot of money. It is a lot of money. It is not enough money to take care of all of the problems caused by smoking out there. In fact, I am pretty sure that if we took the entire assets of every tobacco company in the United States, put them out of business and sold the assets, that that would not be enough money to take care of the problems that have been caused by smoking. 
Unfortunately, the courts have become one of the biggest lotteries that we have in the country. It is a legal lottery, but you have to have a lawyer to scratch your card for you. That has become one of the biggest attorney retirement funds there is. The attorneys typically get about 40 percent of what they win for you. They don't have any pain. They don't have any suffering. They don't have the problems with the smoking. They just provide their legal expertise--and you need that to go to court. In exchange for their legal expertise and the money that you receive, they will get about 40 percent plus expenses. It has been anticipated that probably less than half of whatever money goes into this legal fund will ever get to a smoker. 
So we have the problem of how much is going to get to the smoker. We have the courts jammed up now with everybody trying to be first in line to get his or her money. And I suspect, because we now know how bad the tobacco companies have been, that the first awards by the juries are going to be good ones. This is going to be truly the lottery. This is going to be a lot of money, and it will use up the $6.5 billion each and every year and leave some people without any compensation, or sharing in the lesser pool, or whatever. 
I am trying to figure out how this could be handled and how we could save some of that money so the smokers who are paying the bill could get some of their compensation back, could get some of their health problems taken care of. I am suggesting that we set up a smokers' compensation fund. A lot of people are familiar with Workers Compensation. That goes to the workers on the job. If a worker gets hurt, there is a set procedure already that he can get his medical bills paid and get some compensation for his loss of time and not have to go to court. That is to give him quicker treatment, which is essential, and make sure the doctors understand that they will be paid. It's a system that has developed over more than half a century to try to help the worker. It does preserve some money there. 
I am suggesting that same sort of system could be put in place so smokers, when they have a problem, can be assured of immediate treatment and immediate compensation, and the funds that they and the tobacco companies are paying in would be what provides this fund. So it not only provides for the smokers but it also provides that the nonsmokers are not funding the problem also. That is what we are doing now with Medicare. Medicare dollars from everybody go into the Medicare funds and then Medicare funds go to take care of the extra costs that come with 
the smoking. 
I know that is not possible. It is too complicated. I cannot even do an adequate job, in a limited amount of time, of explaining how smokers' compensation would work and how it would save the courts problems, and how it would assure that everybody would have an equal shot at the money and how there would be enough money, provided we force the companies and the smokers to put that money into the fund. What I am suggesting is that we do put the money from the settlement for tobacco into Medicare and at the same time we begin to collect the statistics from the Medicare fund that show how many of the illnesses that are going into that fund, that are drawing money out of the fund, are smoking related. 
I looked at targeting them, decided that we can keep track of what is smoking related and what is not smoking related, so we will even have enough statistics that we would be able to establish a smokers' compensation fund where the smoking money goes to take care of the smoking problems and so there is money for the people who are there. 
This is going to be a long process. I don't think we will reach a settlement this year. When I was flying back on the plane last weekend, I started making a list of the complications that are going to keep a tobacco settlement from happening. It only takes 51 votes out of the 100 here to stop anything. It is much harder to pass anything in a legislative body than it is to stop it, because when you pass something, it has to go through a whole series of processes starting with the committees, and at any one time in that process, if there is less than a majority vote, it is dead. 
It will have to go through that process here, too. If 51 people don't like the deal that's put together, it is not going to happen. When I was listing those things, I got up to three pages, single spaced, of outline only, of the problems that look to me to be rather insurmountable in dealing with the tobacco settlement. So I don't think anybody will get really excited about what is going to happen and whether it will happen. But one thing they can be assured is we are going to raise prices on tobacco one way or another. So we ought to be both thanking the smokers and asking how we can reduce smoking and how we can take care of the people who are going to be paying the bill on this, which is the smokers. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ENZI. I rise to express my support for the common sense amendment, No. 2170, which would pay down the national debt. 
When Congress was in session, and on most weekends, I traveled thousands of miles throughout the vast State of Wyoming. I polled people on what they think is the most important thing we can be doing with their money. I consistently heard many people say, `If there's a surplus, pay down the debt.' I have to tell you, they don't quite believe in the surplus we keep talking about back here because they understand Social Security. But they don't want us squandering it on new spending and new ideas. 
If recent CBO statistics hold true, we should see a budget surplus of $8 billion in fiscal year 1999--not counting Social Security. However, we did not get to this point by exercising fiscal constraint. We still spend too much. We spend about $1.7 trillion every year. I voted against the spending portion of the balanced budget amendment of 1997 because it seemed clear to me that more could have been done to cut down the size and scope of the Federal Government. We could have enacted more meaningful entitlement reform. We could have gotten the fiscal house in order faster. If not for the unexpected revenues that came as a result of 7 years of economic expansion, we would not be close to eliminating that deficit today. 
Just the interest that we are now paying on the Federal debt has reached about 15 percent of the total budget outlays. That amounts to about $250 billion that cannot be used for education or military readiness or national defense. The only way we can cut down on the amount and percentage of interest paid is to reduce the Federal debt. 
This amendment will accomplish just that. It will set Congress on a path of fiscal responsibility and will require a 30-year pay down of the Federal debt. In the past few months, I 
have seen a unique attitude transformation take place in this city. Even though a budget surplus or zero deficit, only estimated, has not yet occurred, the administration did not hesitate to offer around $100 billion worth of new or expanded programs that would easily create a larger deficit in the proposed balanced budget. It seems their eye for spending is still bigger than the taxpayers' wallet. 
Even though the economy is strong, I am surprised that so few in Congress are concerned about what we, as a nation, are in danger of passing on to our children and our grandchildren. It seems we are tied to the immediate gratification we receive from spending more money that we don't have, that we don't see the danger that looms in the not-too-distant future if we don't stop spending on credit with reckless abandon. That danger is a massive Federal debt and the changing demographics that will place a tremendous amount of pressure on young taxpayers who, if no change is made with the entitlement programs, will see a bankrupt Social Security and Medicare system and a mountain of high debt and an economy so weak that there will be no hope of passing it off--paying it off; we are trying to pass us off. 
Somehow we have convinced ourselves that we deserve these benefits and we will it to our children to figure out a way to pay for them. Throughout the debate in the budget resolution it becomes even more evident that it does not matter whether the economy is performing at record highs or lows, some Members of Congress will always propose more spending and more programs. I have heard numerous excuses this week of why we should spend more of our Federal dollars. 
There seems to be a belief that no matter how much we spend, we are not spending enough for the American people. Before I came to Washington as a Senator, I knew we had a plethora of Federal programs. Now that I am here, however, I am even more astounded at the number of programs available for nearly everything and everyone under the sun. But some still believe the Federal Government is not doing nearly enough to help those in want or need, or more. 
It is very short-sighted to believe that our children or grandchildren will not be left with the bill that is accruing. Do we ever stop to think what the possible consequences are before we propose a program expansion or creation? The Allard amendment would require us to focus on our priorities. It would help us focus on a limited, less-expansive Federal Government. A limited, responsive Federal Government is what the people of Wyoming expect from any government, whether at the State, local or Federal level. They and the other American people deserve a disciplined Federal Government. This amendment will help Congress focus on limiting the scope of Government. 
With a Federal debt of over $5.5 trillion, we must run budget surpluses not just for 1 or 2 years, but for 30 or more years to pay off the debt. I believe the administration and Congress should heed the words of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He noted in his testimony in the Senate Budget Committee on January 29, 1998, that we should be cautious in our spending because Federal revenues are not guaranteed and may fall short of expectations. He, again, advised that we should be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to retire the outstanding Federal debt. He mentions how that will help the economy and save Social Security. 
The Allard amendment follows the advice of Chairman Greenspan. It requires budgetary surpluses every year, with these surpluses going toward payment of the Federal debt. These payments would amortize the debt over the next 30 years, similar to mortgage payments on a $5.5 trillion mansion. Anybody who purchases a house must pay the mortgage that accompanies it. Why should the Federal Government be exempt from a similar requirement? It is the ethical thing to do and it just makes sound economic sense. Yes, we bought a house for ourselves and our kids and our grandkids, and we will pass on the house and we will pass on the debt. But let's be sure that we are current on the payments. 
The Allard amendment will not take money from the Social Security system. To the contrary, it will extend the life and solvency of the Social Security system and other entitlement programs. The best way to shore up Social Security is to pay down the national debt while we work on reforms to the system. 
Now is the time to start making those mortgage payments and to begin to chip away at the mountain of debt. It is irresponsible, reckless, and selfish to wait any longer. Any delay will further jeopardize the national security and economic freedom of our Nation and our children. Some may ask if we can afford to do this now. In response, I will borrow the words of President Ronald Reagan: `If not now, when? If not us, who?' 
I urge my colleagues to support the Allard-Enzi amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior Senator from my state of Wyoming, in the effort to safeguard the integrity of the nation's military memorials from the politically expedient demands of foreign governments--in this case the so-called `Bells of Balangiga' war memorial located in Wyoming's capital city of Cheyenne. I too, am amazed that such legislation is necessary. Amazed, but not surprised. After all, this is a President who seems to have no qualms about throwing overboard those states and communities who have not proven politically valuable to him. I recall his unilateral Utah land grab of the Grand Escalante. I also recall that he, with the Vice President at his side, signed the Presidential directive for that action in Arizona, so unpopular was it in the State of Utah. His unilateral forest roads construction moratorium is another such example of his proclivity for government by executive fiat. 
Many people contend that church bells are not a fitting subject for a war memorial. The circumstances surrounding these particular bells, however, are not normal. As the Senior Senator from Wyoming related, those bells were not used by Philippino insurgents to call the faithful to prayer that harrowing morning. They were used instead to signal the massacre of Wyoming troops as they sat down, unarmed, to breakfast. Of the 74 officers and men in the garrison, only twenty survived. Eye witness accounts had some of the attackers disguised as women, their weapons hidden beneath their dresses. Many others smuggled their weapons into the village hidden in the coffins of children. Under those circumstances, one must conclude that the bells in question were used to kill. Consequently I feel their use as the subject for a war memorial is wholly appropriate. 
This is especially true in light of their intended purpose if returned to the Philippines. As everyone concedes, the Philippine government desires the return of these bells in time for their 100th anniversary of independence. Apparently, these bells do not represent a religious symbol for the Philippine government either. 
Most significant of all, however, is the purpose they currently serve. Contrary to the assumptions of many, they do not memorialize American foreign policies of the time. Nor do they serve as a tribute to our political system, America's turn of the century notions of race relations, or the performance of the American troops who served there during that conflict. Rather, these bells memorialize one thing and one thing only: The tragic and premature deaths of 54 young men who volunteered to do the bidding of the American people. For this purpose I believe these bells serve as a most fitting memorial indeed and I am opposed to its dismantlement. 
It is time to honor our veterans, our war dead, and the principle that in this country, we do not submit to government by Presidential fiat. I ask the support of my colleagues for this legislation.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the Sessions sense-of-the-Congress amendment No. 2166. I firmly believe that the at-home parents who forgo a second income so that one parent can raise their children do deserve some formal recognition by their Federal Government. That is a tough decision for parents to make, but it is one that is being made every day, and it is making a difference to kids. All this sense-of-the-Congress amendment does is to give some extra emphasis to say to parents, if you are making this decision, consider it carefully, consider having one of the parents forgo their income and stay at home and make a better life for the 
kids. The purpose of it isn't to make anybody feel guilty. The purpose of it is simply to make sure that when we are building basic policy, that basic policy includes families and basic policy includes an emphasis on families, and basic policy makes it possible, in any way that we can do it, of keeping parents with their kids. 
All forms of day care touch on one of our Nation's most important resources--our children. If Congress is serious about addressing day care, then we must do so in a fairminded way and not exclude at-home care from the debate. It is unfortunate that at-home care has not received its day in the spotlight. There are more families that fit this mold than I think many of us are aware. 
We have an opportunity through this body to change that and should change it in any way we can. Conditions are difficult for two-income families. It is even harder for single working moms to raise children. Few would argue differently. 
To be fair, however, we must not imply that families who choose to keep one parent at home with their children are not making any sacrifices. They are sacrificing, too. For years, the subtext of Federal family policy is that everyone should work and that the burden of accommodation should be on those parents who choose to stay at home to raise their children. But if the debate revolves around the quality of care our children receive, we must modify existing Federal policy and end this senseless discrimination. 
If we are really concerned about the quality of care for our children, then single-income families should be formally recognized. America's tax burden has grown so large in many instances that a second parent has to work just to pay the family's tax burden. 
A 1993 survey found that more than 50 percent of working women would stay at home if money were not an issue. These parents should not be discriminated against by their own Federal Government simply because they sacrifice greater financial gain for their children. 
The financial penalty inherent in having one parent stay at home to raise their children is large indeed. I do not believe that a majority of single-income families pursue such an arrangement because they can easily afford it. They do it because they believe it is best for their kids. They do it as a conscious decision. It should not be the work of this body to second-guess their judgments and their values. 
Parents who decide to forgo a second income so that one parent might be at home during their children's formative years incur quite an expense, as several Members of my own staff can attest. And I am proud of them for the sacrifices that they are making. But I do not think it is fair, when we talk about Federal policy, that we should build a special policy that discriminates against them. We should be encouraging that kind of behavior. 
It is quite clear that at-home care is beneficial to our Nation's kids. If this viable alternative is excluded from debate, then the message this body sends about the quality of care for America's children is shortsighted, at best. This amendment is geared to provide the recognition that at-home care and the parents who utilize it deserve some recognition. 
This amendment is supported by Democrats and Republicans alike. That is how families are, and it should pass unanimously. I encourage all Members of the Senate to read this amendment, cosponsor it, and vote in favor of its passage. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. I think it is too early in the process to talk about whether we are going to limit liability or not. I have never accepted any money from the tobacco companies. 
I am not trying to help the tobacco companies. What I want is for the smokers of America to realize that there is not enough money in all of the assets of all of the tobacco companies to take care of the problems that have already been caused. What the smokers need to be worrying about is how they are going to divide up those assets to take care of the health problems which have already been caused to be sure that they are getting a piece of the money that they have already paid in and will be paying in through higher taxes. 
We need to wait on the debate to make sure that we are debating the issues on liability and leaving the options open to protect those people who have already been harmed by smoking and those people that will be harmed by smoking. 
As I said, Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. I have worked with the Senator from New Hampshire on the tobacco issue in the Labor Committee and I can appreciate his position on this aspect of the settlement. However, I oppose this amendment because I believe it is premature for this body to decide the issue of immunity, even in a sense of the Senate resolution, before we have the opportunity to debate tobacco legislation on the Senate floor. 
First, I would like to explain that my reasons for opposing this amendment are not based on any desire to protect the tobacco companies from legitimate legal actions. I have explained before that I did not accept any money from the tobacco companies during my campaign because I have seen the destructive effects of cigarette smoking my entire life and I have never seen that smoking ever helped anyone. In short, I oppose this amendment because it is too early in the debate to limit our options on the issue of liability. 
Mr. President, let me make it very clear that we will not help one person suffering from smoking-related illnesses by adopting this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Rather, we will send a green light to plaintiffs' lawyers that Congress will not stand in the way as they fill their retirement coffers at the expense of the smokers and the American public. 
By prohibiting any type of current or future immunity for the tobacco manufacturers, we actually do a disservice to the very people we are trying to help. If Congress is really concerned about providing long-term reimbursement for people suffering from smoking-related illnesses, we should look at ensuring that the money will actually go to smokers--not into the pockets of trial lawyers. 
Mr. President, I have proposed for some time that we should take a look at a smokers' compensation fund, whereby individual smokers could be reimbursed for their smoking-related medical expenses from an account funded by payments by the tobacco companies. Such a system as this would ensure that real stakeholders in the tobacco debate--smokers themselves, would receive the proceeds from any tobacco settlement. It would also be a good way to help the long term solvency of both the Medicare and Medicaid programs by alleviating some of the burden of reimbursing providers for smoking-related medical expenses. 
I understand that any such comprehensive reimbursement scheme is not going to be accomplished this year. That is why I support the efforts of the chairman of the Budget Committee in his efforts to ensure that any money received from a tobacco settlement is going to be dedicated to the Medicare trust fund. I applaud his efforts in ensuring that any possible proceeds actually be used to help pay for the smoking-related expenses of Medicare beneficiaries instead of being used for any number of unrelated programs. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. We should send a message to the American people that any money from the tobacco settlement should be used for smokers--not inflated legal judgments. 
I thank the Senator from New Mexico for the time to speak on this. I fully support putting that money, if we ever get it, into the Medicare Program. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, my original intent was to give some comments on amendment No. 2166. Before I do that, since the topic is opened up on the tobacco settlement, I feel compelled to make a few statements based on what has been said on the floor. 
I am on the Labor Committee and that has been a part of the tobacco settlement debate. I can tell you how far we have gotten on that committee. We have had a filibuster so far on the very issues the Senators from North Dakota have been saying they want to get into the budget. So the progress on this thing has been so disappointing to me. Last week, when I was flying back from Wyoming--I go back almost every weekend, and it's quite a trip to get from there back to Washington--I started working on my laptop computer and listing the reasons why a tobacco settlement might not happen this year. There were three single-spaced pages on why it won't happen this year. I changed it to why it won't happen this year. 
What we are suggesting here is that we ought to go ahead and spend the money anyway. I can't tell how the negotiations have gone that you have been in, but I certainly never have liked to be in negotiations with anybody where I had already spent the money I might get out of the program. That is why we are taking some precaution with that. That is why we are saying let's put it in Medicare. That is the biggest program that we have to save that deals with health--particularly the health of people in the United States. It is something we have to be concerned about. We put that first. There can be changes made later. But after that, there is some agreement from these three pages, single spaced, and reasons why 100 Senators here may not be able to come to any agreement on why there ought to be a tobacco settlement, let alone how that tobacco settlement ought to take place. 
Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes on amendment 2166, the Sessions-Enzi amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today in support of amendment 2166 introduced by me and my colleague and good friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions. Our amendment is entitled the `Antidiscrimination of At-Home Parents Amendment.' 
I am proud to lend my support of this amendment that would give at-home parents, who forego a second income so that one parent can raise their children, the recognition by the federal government that they truly deserve. 
There has been a lot of talk about beefing up the quality and availability of child care across our nation. I, too, have played a role in this debate and feel it's one to be taken seriously. Parents who choose to enroll their kids in day care face a difficult decision--one based on trust, reliability, the quality of care and, of course, the high costs. Moreover, that decision touches one of our nation's most important resources--our children. 
Unfortunately, this debate has unfairly excluded married couples who face an even bigger decision--at-home care. There are more families that fit this mold than I think many of us are aware. In fact, only 37 percent of mothers with children under the age of 6 are employed on a full-time basis. The remaining percentage includes a constituency with little representation. That must change. 
It is true that conditions can be difficult for two income families. I don't refute that. It is very hard for single, working moms to raise children. To be fair, however, we must not imply that families who choose to keep one parent home with their children are not making sacrifices. For years now, the debate on family policy has been centered on single working parents and day care. For years the sub-text of federal family policy has been that everyone should work and that the burden of accommodation should be on those parents who choose to stay at home to raise their children. However, if the debate revolves around the quality of care our children receive, we must modify existing federal policy and end this senseless discrimination. 
It would seem at times as if all forces conspire against single income families. America's tax burden has grown so large that in many instances, a second parent has to work just to pay their families tax burden. A 1993 survey found that more than 50 percent of working women would `stay at home if money weren't an issue.' Most families in which both parents work would much prefer to have one parent stay at home with the children if expenses would allow. 
The financial penalty inherent in having one parent stay at home to raise the children is large indeed. The few families who pursue such an arrangement don't do it because they can easily afford it. They do it because they believe that it is best for their kids. It should not be the work of this body to second guess their judgement of their values. Most importantly, these parents should not be discriminated against by its own federal government simply because they sacrifice greater financial gain for their children. 
As you can see, there are a growing number of parents who give up one income so that the mother or father can stay at home and be with their children. Not long ago, this decision to utilize at-home care was commonplace. However, our nation's workplace has changed significantly as more parents move into the workforce--making parent's decision to sacrifice one income for their child all the more difficult. This is truly saddening, because the people who can best care for our nation's children are the parents. 
I have listened during the last few months to members implying that parents who choose to forego a second income to stay home with their children do so at no financial sacrifice. It has even been implied that such parents lead a life of luxury and self-indulgence while working mothers make the real sacrifice for their children. This notion is as offensive as it is unfounded. 
Parents who decide to forego a second income so that one parent might be at home during their children's formative years incur quite an expense, as several members of my own staff can attest. I have two fathers on my staff that have made this difficult decision. One of those parents on my staff spends four hours each work-day commuting to and from work--only because raising a family on a single, moderate income simply cannot be done here in Washington, DC. I am confident that parents all over the nation are in similar straits. 
If the Senate is serious about issues facing our nation's children, then it must not exclude parents who choose at-home care for the benefit of their kids. If those parents are left out, then the message this body sends about the quality of care for American's children is short-sighted at best. This amendment is geared to provide that recognition and I encourage all members of the Senate to carefully read it, cosponsor it, and vote in favor of its passage. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I yield the remainder of my time but reserve the time remaining for the amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes. I thank Senator Bryan for his comments. 
I am pleased that we have the opportunity to talk about this. I thought we had talked about it last year. I thought that would give enough direction to the Secretary of the Interior that we would not have a problem. 
I want to mention that this amendment is an emergency. That is why we are attaching it to this bill. The comment period for the rules that he has gone ahead and promulgated will run out before we have another opportunity to debate this. I do not want the Department of the Interior to be spending the money to do the process they are doing which bypasses Congress, and it bypasses States rights. 
I want to read a portion of a letter that I have from the National Governors' Association. 
This letter is to confirm Governors' support for the Indian gaming-related amendment offered by Senators Michael B. Enzi, Richard H. Bryan, and Harry Reid to the Senate supplemental appropriations bill. This amendment prevents the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior from promulgating a regulation or implementing a procedure that could result in tribal Class III gaming in the absence of a tribal-state compact, as required by law. 
The nation's Governors strongly believe that no statute or court decision provides the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior with authority to intervene in dispute over compacts between Indian tribes and states about casino gambling on Indian lands. Such action would constitute an attempt by the Secretary of the Interior to preempt states' authority under existing laws and recent court decisions and would create an incentive for tribes to avoid negotiating gambling compacts with states. 
Further, the secretary's inherent authority includes a responsibility to protect the interests of Indian tribes, making it impossible for the secretary to avoid a conflict of interest or exercise objective judgment in disputes between states and tribes. 
That is from the National Governors' Association. 
I see that Senator Reid is on the floor. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Reid.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with my colleagues, the distinguished Senators from Nevada, Senator Bryan and Senator Reid, and the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions. 
This bipartisan amendment touches an issue that is very important to me, and that is the issue of States rights. This amendment is very simple and straightforward. It would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from finalizing the proposed rules published on January 22 of this year. It would also prohibit the Secretary from proposing or promulgating any similar regulations. In effect, this amendment would prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from bypassing the States in the process of approving class III Indian casino gambling. 
Mr. President, I must admit that I am disappointed this amendment is necessary at all. Last year, I offered an amendment, along with a number of my colleagues, on the Interior appropriations bill. We debated that on the floor. That prohibited the Secretary of the Interior from approving any new tribal-State gambling compacts which had not first been approved by the State in accordance with existing law. 
Although that amendment provided only a 1-year moratorium, the intent of the amendment was clear. Congress does not believe that it is appropriate for the Secretary of the Interior to bypass the States or to spend money bypassing the States in an issue as important as whether or not casino gambling will be allowed within a State's borders. 
The debate bore out that intent. I think it was clearly understood. It ended with a voice vote. It was passed by wide bipartisan support. Unfortunately, the Secretary did not think, evidently, that Congress was serious when we passed the amendment last year. 
On January 22 of this year, the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, published proposed regulations which would allow the Secretary of the Interior to bypass the State's authority in the compacting process. In effect, these proposed regulations would allow Secretary Babbitt to approve casino gambling agreements with the Indian tribes without the consent or approval of the States. This is precisely what Congress prohibited in last year's amendment. Evidently, Secretary Babbitt did not think we were serious. 
Mr. President, this amendment is designed to ensure that the proper process is followed in the tribal-State compacting process. There may be those who argue that changes need to be made to the Indian Gambling Regulatory Act. I would not necessarily disagree with my colleagues on that point. However, if any changes are to be made, the changes must come from Congress, not from an unelected Cabinet official. By proposing these regulations, the Secretary of the Interior has shown an amazing disregard for Congress and for all 50 States. 
Mr. President, I have to admit that I find the timing of the Secretary's actions ironic. Just recently, the Attorney General appointed an independent counsel to investigate Secretary Babbitt's actions in regard to approving and denying tribal-State gambling compacts from Indian tribes in Wisconsin. 
Although we will have to wait for the investigation to take its course, it is evident that serious questions have been raised about the Secretary of the Interior's objectivity in approving Indian gambling compacts. We should not allow the Secretary of the Interior to usurp the rightful role of Congress and the States in addressing the difficult question of Indian casino gambling.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple: Society as a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A State's law enforcement, social services, and communities are seriously impacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. Therefore, a decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on Indian lands should be approved by popularly elected representatives, not by an unelected Cabinet official. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rights of the States and the rights of this Congress, as popularly elected leaders, by voting for this amendment. And, Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gorton, also approves of the amendment. I do ask for your consideration of that amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

As a reminder to all Members, the second cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill, was postponed and could occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader if an agreement cannot be reached. As always, all Members will be notified as to when that vote will occur. It is still hoped that an agreement can be worked out.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague from Colorado for his outstanding sportsmanship and for recognition of this great rivalry between two universities that are part of the Western Athletic Conference, a conference that is coming into its own and being recognized nationally. We are certain that because of rankings of two of the teams, and probably three of the teams, they will be in the NCAA National Tournament. There are a lot of kids out there who are well deserving of being in that. They are fierce competitors. Of course, this is one of the old rivalries of basketball. They have been isolated by being in the far West for a long time, and, as a result, have enjoyed playing each other because of what is a close proximity out there. Just being an hour's transportation away is quite a feat in the far West. 
Both schools have outstanding basketball teams. But I would be remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding schools that these basketball teams represent, particularly a portion of the school at Fort Collins that Senator Allard is a graduate of, the veterinarian school, which is world renowned. But both schools have a number of schools that are well recognized throughout the United States and around the world. We hope that kids take a look at both universities when they are interested attending in school. 
Again, I thank my colleague for his gracious comments about the University of Wyoming. The kids there appreciate it. 
I yield my time.

Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Madam President. 
Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that is on the floor and to the McCain-Feingold substitute on campaign finance. Rather than `reform' the way that campaigns are financed, this substitute would infringe on the first amendment rights of millions of American citizens and place enormous burdens on candidates running for office. 
While the McCain-Feingold substitute claims to `clean up' the elections, it does so by placing unconstitutional restrictions on citizens' ability to participate in the political process. For the past few days, we have heard Members of the Senate bemoan the fact that various citizens groups and individuals have taken out ads criticizing them during their elections. I have to admit that I can sympathize with my colleagues who have been the object of often pointed and critical campaign ads. In fact, during my last campaign, some ads were aired against me that were downright false. That is why I support truth in advertising, but this isn't truth in advertising. At the same time, I believe that in a free society it is essential that citizens have the right to articulate their positions on issues and candidates in the public forum. 
The first amendment to our Constitution was drafted to ensure that future generations would have the right to engage in public political discourse that is vigorous and unfettered. Throughout even the darkest chapters of our Nation's history, our first amendment has provided an essential protection against inclinations to tyranny. 
Just a moment ago, the Senator from Michigan mentioned loopholes that we are plugging up. One of the things that always disturbs me about legislation, while legislation is being designed, loopholes are being thought out, loopholes nobody intends to disclose until after they have an opportunity to use them. 
I suggest to you that this piece of legislation and the amendment before us is subject to loopholes. There are people who have already decided how they can get around it. These are not the ethical people. These are the unethical ones. That is unenforced responsibility, that is what unethical activity is. It is also what ethical responsibility is, unenforced responsibility. You can't make somebody who intends to be bad be good, not if they intend to be. 
What we do by placing some of these restrictions on people is say to those who are willing to conform to the rules that they have limitations and those who don't have, don't have limitations. `Oh, well, we will build in penalties, we will make this tough, we will take away the right of those people who intend to follow rules the opportunity to address an issue while it is timely, an issue that really concerns them,' and an issue in this day and age may cost more than they can give to that candidate. We will take that right away from them. But the person who isn't worried about being punished after the fact will go ahead and do exactly what they have been doing all the time. So we are going to put in place a rule that takes away a constitutional right, adds additional burden, builds bureaucracy and takes away the freedom of speech. We are doing it in the name of making contests fairer. But, again, there are people out there thinking of the loopholes as we speak, and there are a lot of them in this. 
The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the first 
amendment to protect the right of individual citizens and organizations to express their views through issue advocacy. The Court has maintained for over two decades that individuals and organizations do not fall within the restrictions of the Federal election code simply by engaging in this advocacy. No time limits, no disclosures, they just do not fall within the restrictions of the Federal election code simply by engaging in advocacy. 
Issue advocacy includes the right to promote any candidate for office and his views as long as the communication does not `in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.' As long as independent communication does not cross the bright line of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, individuals and groups are free to spend as much as they want promoting or criticizing a candidate and his or her views. While these holdings may not always be welcome to those of us running in campaigns, they represent a logical outgrowth of the first amendment's historic protection of core political speech. 
Madam President, this amendment, which parades under the guise of reform, would violate these clear first amendment protections. The amendment impermissibly expands the definition of express advocacy to cover a whole host of communications by independent organizations. The McCain-Feingold amendment attempts to expand bright-line tests for issue advocacy to include communications which, in context, advocate election or defeat of a given candidate. Are we comfortable with giving a Federal regulatory agency the power to determine what constitutes acceptable political speech? 
The substitute gives expansive new powers to the Federal Election Commission. This is one Federal agency which has abused the power it already has to regulate Federal elections. Just last year, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals strongly criticized the Federal Election Commission for its unsupportable action against the Christian Action Network. The network's only crime was engaging in protected political speech. 
The Court of Appeals required the FEC to pay the network's attorney's fees and court costs since the FEC's prosecution had been unjustified. Congress should not condone flagrant administrative abuses by giving the FEC expanded new powers and responsibilities. 
What we have talked about for a year and a half while I have been here is the inability to really look into situations that appear to be pretty flagrant. Now we want to expand their right, after they have not been able to do the job and have enforced their actions in court actions that have been decidedly abusive, we want to give them more power. 
The McCain-Feingold substitute also includes within its new definition of express advocacy any communication that refers to one or more clearly identified candidates within 60 calendar days preceding an election. These provisions would allow the speech police to regulate core political speech during the most crucial part of the election cycle. The amendment that is on the floor right now also talks about that most crucial part of the election cycle. 
They would also place an economic burden on thousands of small radio and television stations which carry these ads. I don't think we in Washington should be placing any more restrictions on America's small businesses. Our Founding Fathers drafted the first amendment to protect against attempts such as these to prohibit free citizens from entering into public discourse on issues that greatly affect them. 
I cannot support legislation that stifles free speech of American citizens and gives expanded new powers to the Federal bureaucracy. For these reasons, I must oppose the McCain-Feingold substitute and the current amendment. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the first amendment and opposing the McCain-Feingold substitute and this amendment and any other amendment that unconstitutionally restricts the rights of citizens to participate in the democratic process. I thank the Chair, and 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of legislation offered by my esteemed colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. I appreciate his steady commitment to improving our nation's public health--especially as it relates to the pending global tobacco settlement. I, too, believe that we have an opportunity to dramatically affect the number of current and future smokers through education, research and regulation of tobacco products. It is my belief that the Prevention Addiction to Smoking Among Teens, or PAST Act, is a significant component that accomplishes just that. 
The PAST Act is the first piece of legislation fashioned after the global tobacco settlement--reflecting the resolution's public health aspects. I commend the Senator and his staff for working with me on remedying a number of outstanding issues in this bill. I look forward to working closely with my colleague on tightening this legislation as it works its way through the mix. 
I do wish to share my thoughts on a number of issues in the global settlement that must not be overlooked. In addition, I would point out that a handful of these issues relating to public health are already addressed in the PAST Act. First, I believe the settlement fails to complement FDA's regulatory role by tapping the expertise of other federal agencies with relative jurisdiction. Second, the look-back provisions prescribed by the global settlement are only geared toward our nation's youth and don't apply to smokers above the age of 18. Third, the settlement focuses largely on reimbursing Medicaid expenditures and ignores enormous Medicare expenditures for smoking related illnesses. Finally, the settlement's overall compensation mechanism fails to address long-term smoking attributed illnesses. In light of these and other inherent difficulties, I am reluctant to embrace the entire global settlement with open arms. We are accepting revenues for past problems and insuring the future without compensation. 
Let me first share my concerns regarding the FDA's role. The global settlement would delegate all regulatory authority of tobacco products to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including advertising and education. Although I favor FDA being the key regulatory agency of tobacco products, I do not believe the agency needs an annual allocation of $300 million to carry out its obligations--that's nearly 10 times what the FDA requested to enforce its original tobacco rule and one-third the agency's total annual budget. Such funding for one agency could not only foster regulatory abuses, but also stretch FDA's internal resources while simultaneously compounding Congress' oversight responsibilities. Such an approach is nothing more than a blueprint for yet another big government bureaucracy incapable of meeting its alleged purpose. I believe Senator Jeffords has acknowledged this predicament in the PAST Act. Rather than allotting $300 million each year for the FDA, the agency would receive $100 million, while other federal agencies with jurisdiction would receive $135 million, with the remaining $65 million going to the states for enforcement. This is a very fairminded approach and we largely avoid an unfunded federal mandate. 
Second, the look-back provisions included in the global settlement were written to be applicable to our nation's youth--ages 18 and under. As a result, Senator Jeffords' bill only addresses the admirable objective of reducing underage smoking. While I have no problem with setting strict goals for reducing underage tobacco use, I firmly believe that the global settlement and any subsequent legislation should not overlook the need to reduce the overall impact of smoking related illnesses. We must be careful not to lend pride of being an adult to smoking. I appreciate Senator Jeffords' commitment to strengthening this section of the PAST Act. 
Third, the global settlement fails to address Medicare smoking-attributable expenditures by focusing all of its attention on reimbursing states for Medicaid expenditures. This is a substantial financial oversight in my opinion. In 1995, the Health Care Financing Administration spent $176.9 billion in Medicare payments. Medicare outlays for fiscal 1996 are estimated to be $193.9 billion. Conservatively assuming that only 5 percent of those expenditures were smoking related, the average Medicare expenditures attributable to smoking during 1995-1996 would still amount to $9.3 billion per year, thereby bringing the twenty-five year total to $192.3 billion. This is an astronomical sum that deserves consideration. 
Finally, the global settlement's reimbursement structure is dubious at best. It is my belief that Senator Jeffords' legislation must receive a sound, long-term financial commitment from the tobacco industry. Under the current settlement, tobacco companies would pay an initial $10 billion, and make annual payments starting at $8.5 billion in the first year and increases to $15 billion in the fifth year of the settlement. While the total estimated payments over 25 years would be $368.5 billion, there is no guarantee under the settlement's structure that the total amount would be collected. Economic conditions could change or tobacco companies could be driven out of business leaving the federal government holding an enormous tab for a very expensive regulatory scheme. Moreover, a large portion of the global settlement total may not even go to reimburse government for the costs of cigarette smoking. The money is designed to fund everything from underage smoking cessation campaigns to potentially large civil damage awards. The scope of expenditures under the global settlement is too broad and the reimbursement mechanism is too incomplete to warrant Congressional approval. 
In the coming weeks, I will continue to advocate an alternative reimbursement mechanism that not only caters to the PAST Act, but compensates for smoking attributed illnesses under the Medicare program as well. Two principles lie at the heart of this alternative approach. First, nonsmoking taxpayers should not be expected to continue footing the bill for what are largely self-induced illnesses. Second, Congress must ensure that the actual compensation fund is solvent for years to come. To these ends, I believe we should give serious thought to a new industry-based approach in which the government determines the costs caused by the manufacturer's product, and then requires the manufacturer and smoker to pay for these costs. Such a program would entirely eliminate smoking-attributed reimbursements from Medicaid and Medicare. 
A `Smoker's Compensation Fund' of this type could be modeled on the Worker's Compensation Funds already in existence in the states. The proceeds for this fund would come from the tobacco industry, and ultimately from smokers themselves in the form of higher cigarette prices. The tobacco industry's annual contributions to the fund could be tied to the number of occurrences of smoking illnesses--the greater the occurrences, the larger the contribution. Using Worker's Compensation as a model, a rolling multi-year average could form the basis of annual premiums to individuals suffering from smoking-attributed illnesses. This would create an economic incentive for the tobacco companies to take actions to reduce tobacco-related illnesses, thereby driving down the number of smokers over the long-term--a true look-back policy. 
Moreover, an industry-based approach would not allow tobacco companies to walk away from long-term smoking attributed illnesses through a total $368.5 billion payment over a 25 year period. Instead, it would administratively make the tobacco companies and the smokers themselves responsible for paying for the medical care of individuals with smoking-related illnesses indefinitely. I believe that the Smoker's Compensation Fund concept would be the best vehicle to provide long-term financial coverage not only for the Medicaid and Medicare programs and smokers of all ages, but for the public health provisions outlined in Senator Jeffords' bill being introduced today. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I too rise as an original cosponsor to express my support for the American Debt Repayment Act and to congratulate Senator Allard for all of his work on this very important issue. 
While Congress was not in session, I traveled several thousand miles across Wyoming. At town meetings I constantly and consistently heard comments such as, `What surplus? If there is any surplus, please pay down the debt. Don't squander any of it on new spending ideas.' 
If recent CBO estimates hold true, we have the lowest deficit in about 30 years. We did not get to that point by exercising fiscal restraint, however. We still spent too much--nearly $1.7 trillion every year. I voted against the spending portion of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 because it 
seemed clear more could have been done to cut down the size and scope of the Federal Government and get our fiscal house in order faster. If not for the unexpected revenues that came as a result of 7 years of economic expansion, we would not even be close to eliminating the Federal deficit today. 
In recent days, I have seen a unique attitude transformation take place in this city. Even though a budget surplus, or even a zero deficit--only estimated, of course--has not occurred yet, the administration has not hesitated to offer over $100 billion worth of new and expanded programs that would easily create a larger deficit in its proposed balanced budget. There are even more tax proposals. It seems the eye for spending is still bigger than our taxpayers' wallets. 
Even though the economy is strong, I am surprised that so few are concerned about the debt we as a nation are in danger of passing on to our children and our grandchildren. It seems we are tied to the immediate gratification we receive from spending money, spending money that we do not even have. We do not see the danger that looms in the not too distant future if we do not stop spending on credit and with reckless abandon. That danger is a massive Federal debt and changing demographics that will place a tremendous amount of pressure and burden on young taxpayers who, if no changes are made to the entitlement programs, will see a bankrupt Social Security and Medicare system and a mountain of debt so high and an economy so weak there will be no hope of paying it off. Somehow we have convinced ourselves that we deserve these benefits. Meanwhile, we will will it to our children to figure out a way to pay for them. 
The interest, just the interest that we are now paying on the Federal debt has reached about 15 percent of the total budget outlays. That amounts to $250 billion that cannot be used for education or military readiness and our national defense or people. The only way we can cut down on the amount of interest paid is to pay down the Federal debt. 
We have a Federal debt of over $5.5 trillion. We must run budget surpluses not just for 1 or 2 years but for 30 or more years to pay off that debt. And the surpluses are not even projected to last that long. I believe the administration and Congress should heed the words of the Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He noted in his testimony to the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, January 29, 1998, that we should be cautious in our spending because Federal revenues are not guaranteed and they may fall short of our expectations. 
He again advised that `we should be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to retire outstanding Federal debt.' That will keep the economy sound and protect Social Security. 
The American Debt Repayment Act follows the advice of Chairman Greenspan. It requires budgetary surpluses every year, with these surpluses going toward payment of the Federal debt. These payments would amortize the debt over the next 30 years, similar to house mortgage payments, only on a $5.5 trillion mansion. Anyone who purchases the house must pay the mortgage that accompanies it. Why should the Federal Government be exempt from a similar requirement? It's the ethical thing to do, and it just makes sound economic sense. Yes, we bought a house for us and our kids, and we will pass on the house and the debt. But let's be sure it's a responsible debt with the payments current. 
Now is the time to start making these mortgage payments and begin to chip away at that mountain of debt. It is irresponsible, reckless, and selfish to wait any longer. Any delay will jeopardize the national security and economic freedom of us, our Nation, and our children. 
Some may ask if we can afford to do this now. In response, I would borrow the words of former President Ronald Reagan: 
If not now, when? If not us, who? 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken as the district court judge for the district of Oregon. I asked for a rollcall vote because I want to be on record as opposing this nominee. I put a hold on this nominee before we left on recess, with adequate time, I assure, for a rollcall vote. I made that a public, not a secret, hold. I wanted anyone interested in the case to know that I wanted a rollcall vote. I know that message got out. I was told that a rollcall vote would be OK, and I am sorry that there was not time or sufficient people around to have a rollcall vote prior to the time that we left. 
I did make a statement on the judge, and I want to reiterate some of my concerns. While I do not question Judge Aiken's experience or academic qualification to sit on the Federal bench, I do have serious concerns about her judicial philosophy as she applied it as a State trial judge in Oregon. 
One particular case has been mentioned this morning, and I appreciate the extra information that has been passed out at this time. That particularly tragic case perhaps best illustrates my concern, and I have looked at five other cases as well that I don't have more information on. In the case of the State v. Ronny Lee Dye, a 26-year-old man was convicted, convicted, of first-degree 
rape--first-degree rape--of a young 5-year-old girl. Instead of sentencing this convicted rapist to State prison, Judge Aiken sentenced him to 90 days in jail and 5 years probation, plus a $2,000 fine. The other option was 5 years in prison. 
There was concern about whether there would be enough rehabilitation in prison. The option was there for 5 years in prison and the effort to get a rehabilitation program in that prison. If I were the parents of a 5-year-old child that was raped and knew the convicted rapist could receive between 90 days and 5 years, I would have serious concerns about anybody who voted for that judge. Out of a concern for those parents, I am opposed to this nomination. According to the local papers, Judge Aiken did not want to sentence Dye to State prison because the prison did not have a sex-offender rehabilitation program. There are folks out in my part of the country that would insist on some other kind of rehabilitation. Moreover, she believed that probation following the jail term provided a stricter supervision than the parole that would have followed a prison sentence. Less than 1 year after his conviction for rape, Dye violated his parole by driving under the influence of alcohol and having contact with minor children without permission of his probation officer. I believe Judge Aiken's handling of this case and others illustrates an inclination towards an unjustified leniency for convicted criminals. 
Mr. President, I do not pretend to be able to predict with any degree of accuracy how this nominee or any other will rule while on the Federal bench. In exercising our solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent on the President's nominations for the Federal courts, we have only the past action, statements and writings to guide our deliberations. Moreover--and this is one of my big concerns--since Federal judges have life tenure and salary protection for the rest of their lives while they are in office, we have but one opportunity to voice our concerns and disapproval of a judge's record. 
Now, I understand that she has been repentant of what she did at an early time in her judgeship. But I have got to tell you that I think that we give out Federal judgeships for service, not for repentance. We talk about law and order. We have to back up that law and order through the court system as well, not just with words in this Chamber. 
I, for one, cannot vote to confirm a nominee to the Federal court who I believe is inclined to substitute his or her personal policy preferences to those of the U.S. Congress or any other State legislature. I have strong concerns that Judge Aiken, if confirmed, would be inclined to this type of judicial activism. For this reason, I asked for a rollcall vote. 
I appreciate the opportunity for me to go on record as being against the confirmation of Judge Aiken. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, in the last 3 hours there has been some pretty heavy lifting and some excellent debate by both sides about what is to come of this country. But I am going to take just a moment and let everyone relax and reflect a little bit and realize that everything in the world isn't happening right here in Washington. I want to bring some attention to some things that have happened over the last weekend. 
One of those, of course, was the Super Bowl game. I want to congratulate those Broncos and people in Wyoming and Colorado who are avid supporters of that team. They did a wonderful job as fans, as players. It was a great game. But something that is not as well known out of this part of the country is that there is the Western Athletic Conference. There are a bunch of basketball players out there that are having a great year. 
Some people may have heard about Utah because, frankly, they are No. 4 in the Nation right now. You may have heard about New Mexico because they are also in the top 20 in the Nation. But I want to talk just for a moment about another team that is going to be in that top 20 in the Nation, and that is Colorado State University, a small university in northern Colorado just south of Wyoming. This last weekend we had an event called the `Border 
Wars.' That is an event that has been going on for 101 games in Laramie, WY, alone. They play the other half of the games in Colorado. So the oldest traditional rivalry in basketball, probably, in the United States--101 games. This last weekend was the event of that 101st game. 
I cannot convey to you enough the rivalry that we have between these two schools that have been playing for that long and that are only separated by 45 miles, which out in our part of the country is very little distance. 
It is my pleasure to say that Colorado State University won that game. They beat an outstanding team. That is why you are going to hear more about Colorado State University. They won that game 53-46. They got out to a 9-0 lead in the game, then a 15-2 lead, which is almost what their record is this year, 15-3, a pretty outstanding record, particularly in that conference. They are 3-2 in the Western Athletic Conference. But they have won nine of their home games, only losing one. Their coach, Stew Morrill, has done an outstanding job with the team that came back from last year. As most people do not realize, they had that entire team back for another season. And they will have a great season. 
So keep your eye on the Western Athletic Conference and particularly Colorado State University. 
This is such a rivalry that this last weekend I had the pleasure of hosting Senator Allard and his wife Joan for the basketball game in Wyoming. As part of that competition, part of that rivalry, I agreed that if Wyoming lost that game, I would wear this Colorado State tie for a week. It was really fun having the folks from Colorado come up and to have that competition continue. I want to congratulate Senator Allard for the outstanding job that they did. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I come to the floor--in the waning hours of this session--to express my continuing frustration with the way that the Environmental Protection Agency is handling Wyoming's environmental audit law. The troubles began last September, when the EPA delayed granting final approval of Wyoming's clean air permitting plan. 
Earlier this year, I joined with the other Members of Wyoming's congressional delegation in sending a letter to Administrator Carol Browner at the EPA. We suggested that it was inappropriate to withhold delegation of Clean Air Act permitting authority because of the State's environmental audit law. Administrator Browner responded with an assurance that, 
EPA has not taken steps to withhold further delegations of Federal programs in Wyoming as a result of the State environmental audit law. 
In September, the EPA announced that it had completed its review of Wyoming's audit law. It found that, 
The State won't need to make statutory changes to the self-audit law to retain primacy over Federal laws like the Clean Air Act. 
The EPA went on to say that, 
The law shouldn't interfere with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality's efforts to gain primacy over several other Federal programs. 
Mr. President, in spite of Ms. Browner's assurances, there has been a very real and ongoing manipulation of States that attempt to craft sensible audit laws. I trust that my colleagues from Colorado, Utah, Michigan, and Texas would be able to verify that activity. Their States have all been coerced by the EPA into changing their audit laws. 
On October 29, I introduced the State Environmental Audit Protection Act, which is S. 1332. This bill would provide a safe harbor from EPA's coercive actions for States that adopt reasonable audit laws. The next day, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee held a very good hearing on the issue. We listened to an excellent panel of witnesses on both sides of the issue. Both myself, and Senator Hutchison of Texas--who has also introduced legislation to resolve this problem--testified on the need for Federal legislation. 
I was interested to read in the paper on October 30, the day after the hearing, that the EPA is now requiring Wyoming to change its law. The EPA has submitted legislation to a special session of the Wyoming legislature. On Monday, a joint committee in Cheyenne heard preliminary testimony on the revisions. The proposal would strike at least 50 percent of Wyoming's law regarding discovery of evidence in criminal proceedings.

Mr. ENZI. I appreciated the comments earlier of the Presiding Officer. I learned a great deal from listening to the Senator talk of the people that have gone before her. Of course, that reminds me of people that have gone before me from my State and all of those who have gone before us in this great body. We not only think about those who have gone before, we think about those people who are here now, those people who are at home in our respective States at the moment, and those people who are relying on our judgment in this Chamber today to preserve the right for them to be here or in Maine or in Wyoming in the future.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, today I rise to oppose a nomination. I want to tell you, I have a hold on a nomination. It is not a secret hold. Those that are interested in the nomination know I have the hold on it. I would not do that in secret. The purpose is not for secrecy. The purpose is to get an action that will show on the record, that will be reflected by this body for years to come. That is what we were sent here for. 
Judge Ann Aiken has been nominated by the President of the United States to be a District Court Judge for the District of Oregon. I have asked for a rollcall vote because I want to be on record as opposing this nominee. I don't question Judge Aiken's experience or academic qualifications to sit on the Federal bench. I do have serious concerns about her judicial philosophy as she has applied it in State court in Oregon. One particularly tragic case perhaps best illustrates concern. It is the case of State versus Ronny Lee Dye, a 26-year-old man who was convicted of first-degree rape of a 5-year-old girl. Instead of sentencing this convicted rapist to State prison, Judge Aiken sentenced him to only 90 days in jail and 5 years' probation, plus a $2,000 fine. According to local papers, Judge Aiken did not want to sentence Dye to state prison because the prison did not have a sex offender rehabilitation program. 
How do you think the parents of that girl felt? Moreover, she believed that the probation following the jail term provided a stricter supervision than the parole that would have followed the prison sentence. 
Less than a year after the conviction for rape, Dye violated his parole by driving under the influence of alcohol and having contact with minor children without permission of his probation officer. I believe that Judge Aiken's handling of this case and others illustrates an inclination toward an unjustified leniency for convicted criminals. 
I do not pretend to be able to predict with any degree of accuracy how the nominee or any other will rule while on the Federal bench in exercising our solemn constitutional duty to advise and consent on the President's nominations for Federal courts, what this body stands for, we have only the past action, statements and writings to guide our deliberations. Moreover, since Federal judges have life tenure--life tenure--and salary protection while in office we have but one opportunity to voice our concerns in disapproval of a judge's record. 
I, for one, cannot vote to confirm a nominee to the Federal court who I believe is inclined to substitute his or her personal policy preferences for those of the U.S. Congress and the various State legislatures. I have strong concerns about this judge. If confirmed, would she be inclined to this type of judicial activism? For this reason, I will cast my vote against the confirmation of Judge Aiken and insist on a rollcall vote so that it will be recorded. 
That may result in a delay in that court, but I think it is an important delay. I don't think I'm the only one opposing this, and I will insist on the rollcall vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fast-track bill that is before us. I have followed the debate on this legislation very closely. I have listened to my colleagues discuss at length the issues of trade flows, foreign direct investment, the delegation of authority, and unfair trade agreements. It has been an interesting debate for this freshman Senator. 
I want to share with my colleagues the feelings that my constituents have expressed to me. Many of them have deep concerns about our progress on trade. Intense import competition makes them feel as if they have been left behind in the pursuit of fair trade. 
There is an issue here that is far more important to my constituents than trade, however, but it is inextricably linked to their ability to compete. While the administration vows to fight for fair trade with foreign countries, people in Wyoming want this administration to fight for fair regulation in this country. For them, fair trade will not stimulate economic growth when their growth is halted by unreasonable regulations. 
It seems that there is a real disconnect in our administration's policies on economic health. While one side of the administration is promoting job growth in exports, the other side is shutting down our enterprises with overly restrictive environmental regulations. 
There is an inconsistency here that is difficult to explain to people in Wyoming. They do not understand why the administration supports export growth, but allows the Environmental Protection Agency to issue and adopt regulations such as the new particulate matter and ozone standards for air quality. 
How does this relate to the fast-track bill we are debating? It connects in two ways. The first issue is jobs. The purpose of the bill before us is to promote job growth--which is a good purpose and I support it. Unreasonable regulatory mandates, however, do not create jobs. Second, like fast track, environmental regulation is a delegated authority. And in my opinion, it is one delegated authority that is out of control. 
Let me first discuss what is wrong with the standards and how they will destroy jobs. They were formulated and adopted with a disturbing lack of scientific consensus; with no accountability; and with a genuine disregard for the real effects they will have on working people. 
The accuracy of scientific information in the formulation of scientific rules is critical for a democracy. Democracies cannot survive without being able to rely on the precision of their scientific information. Furthermore, democracies cannot survive when bureaucracies are able to impose expensive mandates without any accountability. Democracy depends on representation along with taxation. Bureaucrats must consult with elected representatives before imposing massive costs on our citizens. 
With the adoption of these unreasonable standards, the EPA and the administration have failed on both of these counts. 
There are numerous examples that show a lack of scientific consensus in the promulgation of these new air quality standards. The EPA's own Clean Air Science Advisory Committee, stated that at this point, `there is no adequately articulated scientific basis for making regulatory decisions concerning a particulate matter National Ambient Air Quality Standard.' 
The administration's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences dismissed the EPA's claims about the relationship between childhood asthma and air quality. They observed that the asthma rate in Philadelphia has soared even as that city's air pollution levels have plummeted. They also noted that some of the highest asthma rates in the world occur in Australia and New Zealand--two countries with excellent air quality. 
Strangely enough, while the EPA is promulgating expensive rules, other agencies have been pushing for economic growth. The U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, the Small Business administration, and the Department of Agriculture--have all advocated the importance of fast track for growth. 
Even the President has emphasized the need for fast track in terms of job creation. He stressed that, 
`In order for us to continue to create jobs and opportunities for our own people, and to maintain our world leadership, we have to continue to expand exports . . . We have to act now to continue [our] progress to make sure our economy will work for all the American people.' 
Well, I stand here to tell you that unreasonably expensive regulations will not make our economy work for all American people. Achievements in trade expansion will not overcome the excessive costs imposed by regulatory mandates. 
And the costs are excessive. At first, the EPA estimated the cost would be less than $2.5 billion. Then, the President's own Council of Economic Advisors put the price at a considerably higher $60 billion. I have seen estimates for the cost as high as $150 billion. That was an amount quoted in a Senate Small Business Committee hearing we held earlier this year. I think the difference in magnitude between these estimates--$2.5 billion and $150 billion--deeply concerns me, and is--in and of itself--a good reason to delay the standards. 
The disagreement continues. The EPA stated in its regulatory impact analysis that the rules will not have a significant effect on small businesses. But the Small Business Administration refuted that. The SBA confirmed that, `Considering the large economic impacts suggested by EPA's own analysis, [which] will unquestionably fall on tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of small businesses--this would be a startling proposition to the small business community.' 
It will affect hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Just who are we trying to help our trade policy, Mr. President?

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State Environmental Audit Protection Act. It is a bill that would improve environmental quality across this Nation by enlisting the voluntary aid of people to seek out environmental problems and to correct violations using State environmental audit laws. This legislation would provide protection for those States that have fully debated the issue and after the debate, have chosen to enact aggressive and proactive environmental audit laws. 
First, I would like to explain briefly what an audit law is and how it works. State legislatures have chosen to enact many different kinds of audit laws with varying levels of incentives. It is important to note that audit laws are not all the same. This concept is apparently lost on those who try to mis-characterize every audit law in the most sinister and fearful terms. It is important that we recognize the difference. 
The purpose of audit laws are to provide incentives for regulated entities to search for and disclose environmental violations and to clean them up at their own expense. Entities cover all kinds of groups with operations that may have an effect on the environment, such as businesses, schools, hospitals, towns, and counties. The incentives can range from relief from penalties to protection of voluntarily gathered information. The incentives usually require full disclosure and due diligence in correcting violations. When there is protection of information, some States simply agree not to inspect based on disclosure of an audit, others go further by allowing that certain documents will not be used against the entity in enforcement actions. 
It is important to keep in mind when considering protection of documents that audits are conducted in good faith. By definition, any information that is compiled is voluntary and as such is above and beyond what is otherwise required by law. Following from that, any disclosures are a net gain above traditional enforcement. 
Consider for a moment, Mr. President, the decisions a small business faces with regard to its environmental performance. Many small businesses are already required to monitor and report certain emissions and audit protections do not cover those reports. But consider a business that is not on an inspection schedule and has no required emissions reporting. If that entity wants to review its performance under environmental laws, it would have to conduct a study. It would have to pay an auditor to come in and review its operations--that would be voluntary. Without audit protection, that business would take on a big risk--a risk big enough so that most small entities would never undertake a voluntary audit. The risk is that once they spend the money to review their activities, if they find a violation and report it, they face both fines and cleanup expenses. Furthermore, if they don't report it, they risk criminal activity by knowingly violating the law. 
Faced with the liabilities, without an audit law, most people would not voluntarily police themselves. The risks are too big. Folks choose instead to just take their chances and wait for the inspectors. After all, inspectors only visit 2 percent of all regulated entities anyway. Just 2 percent, Mr. President. 
How do we encourage the other 98 percent to really think about their environmental performance? 
Audit laws recognize good-faith efforts to improve environmental compliance. They encourage people to look for problems and know with assurance that they won't be penalized for their efforts. 
Today, Mr. President, 24 States have enacted some form of audit law; 16 more have legislation pending. These laws have been on the books for several years in some States and I would point out--you don't see the examples of abuses that many claimed would occur during the State legislative debates. 
Wyoming is one of the States that has passed an audit law. I was the prime sponsor in that process during my time in the Wyoming State Senate. I studied examples and results from other States that had gone through the process. I worked closely with our State Department of Environmental Quality and with members of the regulated community. I worked with various resource and conservation groups in Wyoming and we crafted a bill that provides very reasonable incentives for people to review their operations and clean up the problems they find. We provided no criminal immunity or criminal privilege. We deferred to Federal laws wherever conflicts existed. There was a consensus. The bill made it out of committee unanimously and then passed the House and the Senate by more than a two-thirds majority. 
We had a vigorous debate in Wyoming. In the end, after all the public deliberation, we passed a reasonable bill. But it was a consensus of the legislators elected by the people of Wyoming. When I got to Washington, several States were meeting with the EPA. The EPA was using threats of overfiling and delayed approval of State enforcement programs. Overfiling means the EPA could use a document done at extra expense and exposure to a company in order to be sure there was no harm to the environment, only to find the EPA could use those documents as a road map for levying fines. The EPA wanted us to change the Wyoming law--in spite of repeated assertions from our own State attorney general that the law did not compromise our enforcement authority. 
Wyoming's scenario is not unique. Working with other States where this has happened has led me to offer this piece of legislation. 
The strange thing I find is that the EPA touts the value of audits. The concept has been trumpeted as part of their reinventing environmental regulation initiative and a final policy on audits was released in early 1996. Administrator Carol Browner called it, `a policy that provides real incentives for industry and others to voluntarily identify and correct environmental violations.' 
President Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union Address, stressed the need for more common sense and fairness in our environmental regulations. He recognized the limitations of the command and control approach. He stated that `Washington is not the source of all answers and that we should shift more decision-making authority from the Federal Government to States, tribes and local communities.' 
Apparently the EPA feels the States are not ready to handle audits. Apparently, Mr. President, State attorneys general are unable to verify with certainty that audit laws are reasonable. In its own astonishing way--and in seeming contradiction to its own objectives--the EPA remains opposed to State efforts to reinvent command and control through the use of audits. 
The problem with EPA's audit policy is that ordinary people do not want to use it. Big business will agree to negotiate with the EPA. They will enter into cooperative agreements and consent agreements because they have entire departments of environmental litigators. 
Small businesses don't have that. They don't trust the EPA. They see the EPA Office of Compliance Assistance trying to help them out, while Criminal Enforcement across the hall is concocting ways to put them in jail--and boy would those offices love to work together. The EPA has little accountability to folks at home. It is just too unpredictable. That is why people need statutory protection before they will take on the potential liability of audits. 
I would like to take a minute to explain my approach to the issue. The legislation I am introducing would provide a safe-harbor for State laws that fit within certain limits. It would not give any authority to any State unless they go through the full legislative process, including all of the local discussion and debate that entails. That is a critical part of this process and something we should recognize. The boundaries of the safe-harbor we create would describe what State laws may provide: 
Limited protection from discovery for audit information--but only information that is not required to be gathered. All legal reporting requirements and permitting disclosures remain in effect and could not be covered by an audit privilege.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the action of my State's Governor in proclaiming September 19, 1997, as Wyoming's POW/MIA Recognition Day. I believe such a proclamation to be wholly appropriate in light of the fact that over 2,000 Americans are still missing in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, and over 8,000 on the Korean Peninsula. These men gave their last full measure in causes whose worthiness is rendered more secure with every passing year of historical distance. Though the same can be said of all who sacrificed so, we often forget the sacrifice of those who have no headstones to call to us each memorial day. Hence the importance of efforts such as Governor Geringer's, which remind the Nation of our continuing and unfulfilled responsibility to account for the remains of these men for the sake of their families and our national conscience. I am reminded of something written half a century ago: 
The universe is so vast and so ageless that the life of one man can only be justified by the measure of his sacrifice. 
That passage was in a young Royal Air Force pilot's last letter to his mother before his death during the Battle of Britain. I commend Governor Geringer for his proclamation and I urge the President to intensify his efforts at retrieving the remains of America's missing in action. In their sacrifice they proved their measure. America owes them this small debt.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in favor of campaign reform, but not the proposal before us. I resent that we must apparently be for this bill before us or we are pictured as being opposed to reform. 
This bill has gone through somewhat of a transformation, but not much. Rather than reform the way campaigns are financed, this legislation would infringe on the first amendment rights of millions of American citizens and place enormous burdens on candidates running for office. We must ensure the enforcement of the current law before we build a whole new bureaucracy. That is what we are talking about. 
I believe this debate over changes in campaign laws is especially timely in light of the recent discovery of the video tapes of the White House coffees. It is illegal to campaign, it is illegal to raise money on Federal property. They are more suspicious since the White House withheld the critical evidence from the investigative committee for over 8 months. They just found the tapes? They just found part of the tapes--44 out of 150? How hard can tapes be to find? Don't they have a procedure for storing tapes? If they are important enough for history in the first place, should there not be a mechanism for finding them? 
While it's not clear what took place, it calls out for a serious investigation and the appointment of a special prosecutor. 
Now we want to add extra criteria. If we just add them, will Congress be the only ones who have to abide by them? Will an acceptable defense be that everybody is doing it, even if that is not true? One of the lessons I learned in my 18 years in elected office is that you don't increase compliance with existing laws by increasing the complexity. We haven't talked about truth in advertising. We haven't talked about how much money is being spent and a way to disclose and to get accurate and complete disclosure from all groups that are involved in the process. We are only touching on campaign finance reform, and we are calling it the whole ball of wax, the whole answer to everything. 
Mr. President, while the McCain-Feingold legislation claims to clean up elections, it does so by placing unconstitutional restrictions on citizen's ability to participate in the political process. For the past few weeks, we have heard Members of this Senate bemoan the fact that various citizen groups have taken out ads criticizing them during their elections. Having just run my first statewide campaign last year, I can sympathize with my colleagues who have been the object of often pointed and critical campaign ads. I've said frequently that campaigns need a good truth in advertising law. That's not restriction of free speech. That's requiring honest speech. Yes, there are fine lines of spin, but we haven't even tried to clean up the blatantly wrong ads. Instead we want to restrict the right to even tell the truth. I believe that in a free society it is essential that citizens have the right to articulate their positions on issues and candidates in the public forum. The first amendment to our Constitution was drafted to ensure that future generations would have the right to engage in public political discourse that is vigorous and unfettered. Throughout even the darkest of chapters in our Nation's history, our first amendment has provided an essential protection against inclinations to tyranny. Our political future relies on the protection of free speech. 
The Supreme Court has consistently held that the first amendment protects the right of individual citizens and organizations to express their views even through issue advocacy and even if its aimed at an individual. The Court has consistently maintained that individuals and organizations do not fall within the restrictions of the Federal election code simply by engaging in this advocacy. 
Issue advocacy includes the right to promote any candidate for office and his views as long as the communication does not in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate. As long as independent communication does not cross the bright line of expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate, individuals and groups are free to spend as much as they want promoting or criticizing a candidate and his views. While these holdings may not always be welcome to those of us running campaigns, they represent a logical outgrowth of the first amendment's historic protection of core political speech. We talk about how much money is spent that way for advocacy, but we are just guessing. We are jumping to the step of precluding that right of free speech talking about how much the cost of campaigns have gone up, but we don't even have a mechanism for reporting that in any meaningful way. That should be the first step. We need quick and complete disclosure of all funds spent in a campaign, directly and indirectly. That means hard money and soft. We need to know from where and whom it comes and for what it was spent. Obviously we need to know how the money got there. We need to know that the laws on collecting it apply to everyone. That's a simpler step than what is proposed and more constitutional too. 
These unconstitutional restrictions of this bill would increase the power of the media elites at the expense of the average American voter. Our Founding Fathers drafted the first amendment to protect against attempts such as these to prohibit one segment of our society from entering into public discourse on issues that greatly affect them. 
I commend the sponsors for eliminating from the most recent version of their legislation the provision that forced businesses to give away their product in the form of free broadcast time. I also appreciated them taking out the complicated funding formulas. Nonetheless, I still cannot support legislation that stifles the free speech of the American citizens and gives expanded new powers to a Washington bureaucracy. For these reasons, I must oppose the revised McCain-Feingold legislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in paying trouble to the first amendment and opposing the McCain-Feingold legislation. 
I thank the Chair and yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Safety Advancement for Employees Act of 1997. I send the bill to the desk. 
Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the bill be dispensed with. 
Mr. President, during this first Session of the 105th Congress, my esteemed colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and I, each introduced a bill related to workplace safety and health. On July 10, a comprehensive OSHA oversight hearing was held by Chairman Frist in the Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety. This hearing specifically focused on OSHA modernization legislation pending before the committee. The results of this hearing further confirmed the commitment Senator Gregg and I share concerning the safety and health of our Nation's workforce. 
It is with great pleasure that Senator Gregg and I, introduce this consensus legislation. The SAFE Act has the support of Subcommittee Chairman Frist, as well as Labor Committee Chairman Jeffords. Both are proud to be original cosponsors and I am sincerely grateful to them for all their hard work. They have clearly helped pave the way for this important measure. In addition, my House colleague and chairman of the Small Business Committee, Jim Talent, will introduce similar legislation in the House today. This legislation has received strong bipartisan support--an essential ingredient in the recipe for success. 
It is important to understand that both the Senate and House versions do not attempt to reinvent OSHA's wheel, just change its tires. Treading water for 27 years, OSHA has never seriously attempted to encourage employers and employees in their efforts to create safe and healthful workplaces. Instead, OSHA chose to operate according to a command and control mentality. This approach has lead to burdensome and often incomprehensible regulations which may not relate to worker safety and health and are, quite often, only sporadically enforced. Even the AFL-CIO has acknowledged that with only 2,451 State and Federal inspectors regulating 6.2 million American worksites, an employer can expect to see an inspector once every 167 years. 
While changing OSHA's bald tires, it is important to point out that the SAFE Act does not dismantle OSHA's enforcement capabilities. That approach has been tried time and time again. But, enforcement alone cannot ensure the safety of our Nation's workplaces and the health of our working population. America would be better served by an OSHA that places a greater emphasis on promoting employers and employees working together and this bill would strike that balance. 
The SAFE Act is geared to provide employers who seek a safe and healthful workplace for their employees with the ability to obtain compliance evaluations from qualified, third party consultants. In addition, the SAFE Act includes additional voluntary and technical compliance initiatives to assist employers in deeming their worksites safe for their employees. Businesses and employees need clarification on a whole host of issues. They need progress, now. We need good commonsense legislation that advances safety and health of the American workplace, now. 
Senator Gregg and I are not interested in making another political statement. It is time for us to tuck the political statements into our coat pockets and pass good common sense legislation that advances the safety and health of the American workplace. Advancing safety and health in the American workplace is a matter of great importance and it must be considered in a serious and rational manner by Congress, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, by employers, and yes, by employees too. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe that the SAFE Act represents a clean start to addressing the problems that affect OSHA and its dealings with employers and employees. Senator Gregg and I, are quite eager to continue working with my Senate and House colleagues on this important matter. By working together in a bipartisan fashion, we can ensure our Nation's work force that Congress does care about their personal safety and health. I welcome your support in doing just that.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. 
Where has our country gone when people appearing before a Senate committee have to have their voices disguised and have to be behind partitions? 
I commend the Senate Finance Committee for holding the hearings examining the Internal Revenue Service. These hearings have given the American people an insight into one of the most powerful and secretive of Federal agencies. I applaud Chairman Roth and members of the Finance Committee for their diligence in examining this agency. 
For any who might have missed the hearings, on my web site, which is www.senate.gov/enzi/, you can get the full text of the comments made before the committee. There is also an opportunity there to do an easy e-mail to comment on what has gone on in those hearings. It is important for this body to follow up on those hearings with a complete reexamination of the Nation's tax policy and the IRS. If we are ever to be successful in establishing a just tax code, we in Congress must first come to a consensus about our underlying tax policy. 
In the past 3 days, we have heard stories from taxpayers who have been mistreated by an inefficient and confrontational Internal Revenue Service. Taxpayers testified that they were forced into personal and financial ruin by an all-too-often faceless agency with little accountability to either the American taxpayers or to Congress. 
We have heard about the enormous power of the IRS, which includes the power to take a taxpayer's home on nothing more than the signature of the district director. There is no court hearing. There is no notice. There is no opportunity to litigate the merits of the Service's claim. The IRS has the power to close down a person's business and take away his livelihood by merely filing a few papers in Federal court. The judge signs a seizure order without ever giving the taxpayer notice or an opportunity to contest the legality of the assessment or the amount of the tax 
owed or the problem with the computer system. 
Madam President, this is precisely the kind of abuse by our Government our Founding Fathers were attempting to avoid when they included the fourth and fifth amendments in the Bill of Rights. These actions amount to administrative tyranny. 
As I have traveled around the State of Wyoming, I have heard a great deal of concern about the present state of the IRS. Our Tax Code is so frustratingly complex that even the professional tax preparers are pleading for simplicity. These folks know that the present Tax Code exposes them to a great deal of liability due to the likelihood of conflicting interpretations of the code and its myriad of accompanying regulations. 
As an accountant myself, I am sympathetic to the concerns of those who claim that even the experts cannot agree on many of the provisions of the current system. It is unfair to expect Americans to operate under a tax system with such a mind-numbing complexity and inherent contradictions. 
Under the current regime, it is perhaps the moderate-income taxpayer and the small businessman who suffer the most. That is not how audits are supposed to work. One of the most surprising facts which came out of the testimony this week is the significant increase in audits of lower income people and very small businesses over the past several years. This increase is not because the IRS believes these people have large amounts of unreported income. Rather, it is because the Service believes these people are the least likely to fight them after an audit since they can least afford professional tax preparers and expensive legal counsel. 
Just this week, I heard from some small business owners in Wyoming who have been battling the IRS for 5 years over $200,000 in taxes they are convinced they do not owe. After a 3-year onsite audit, the IRS determined that they only owed $30,000, including the fines and penalties. Even though they disputed this amount, they figured they had no choice but to pay it since they could not afford to take the case to court. Moreover, the agency threatened that if they didn't agree to pay the bill, IRS would reopen the investigation and insinuated that this might result in even more money owed. That is blackmail. This treatment of our citizens is unjust. An agency which turns to coercion and intimidation to settle unreasonable disputes is in desperate need of reform. 
Madam President, while I realize that many of the IRS agents are hard-working, dedicated public servants, I am convinced the problems we have heard about this week are more than isolated occurrences. Instead, they represent a systematic disease which cannot be cured by tinkering with the current Tax Code or modifying a few Internal Revenue Service procedures. I believe these hearings will force us to reexamine the specifics of our current code and our underlying policy as well. 
I have made the examination of our tax policy one of my top priorities for my service in the Senate. I will work with my colleagues toward developing a policy that reflects the legitimate priorities and goals of raising revenue for a Government which should in its every facet serve the people from whom it derives its power, not control the people from whom it derives its power. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the lack of information pertaining to alcohol and substance abuse fatalities in the workplace is alarming. If we are serious about the safety of American workers, we must carefully examine all contributing factors that pose a potential threat while on the job. 
I had intended to offer an amendment to the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations bill that would instruct the BLS to incorporate in their annual report an analysis of toxicology reports in the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. After meeting with the BLS Commissioner, Katharine Abraham, we agreed that the BLS will again perform this important analysis during the calendar year 1998 and issue a report no later than 6 months after the data collection is completed. This agreement dismisses the need for a congressional mandate. I appreciate BLS's cooperation in properly addressing this matter. 
In 1992, the Department of Labor initiated a program to compile data on how alcohol and drugs contributed to fatal work injuries. The BLS's Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries Program collected 1,355 toxicology reports from 43 States and the District of Columbia--roughly one report for every four of the 1992 fatalities. About one-sixth of the cases for which toxicology reports were available, fatally injured workers tested positive for toxic substances. The most frequent cases showed alcohol use followed by cocaine and marijuana. 
Unfortunately, the BLS stopped collecting this data in 1995. Although this data was only reported over a 3-year span, it clearly shows that alcohol and substance abuse is a major contributor to fatal workplace injuries. In an effort to understand the safety of American workers, we must have data available to us. The inclusion of this analysis in the annual report sends a message that we do care about the safety of American workers. 
Prior to being elected to the U.S. Senate, I was an accountant for Dunbar Well Service in Wyoming--a large, independent oil well servicing company. Aside from my accounting responsibilities, I also traveled the State collecting urine and saliva samples from our employees. Not only have I given alcohol and substance abuse tests, but I've been tested. I understand a thing or two about validity and dignity. This analysis doesn't hinder either of those traits. Safety in the workplace should be everyone's concern. However, if we don't understand how our workers are killed on the job, then we only deceive ourselves. This analysis will provide a better understanding of why and how frequently alcohol and drugs play a contributory role in fatal work injuries.

Mr. ENZI. President, I rise to briefly discuss S. 648, a bill to establish standards and procedures for products liability legislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill and I feel that it should be a legislative priority for consideration during this session of the 105th Congress. 
In the 104th Congress, both the House and Senate passed meaningful product liability reform legislation only to have it vetoed by President Clinton. The President now indicates that he wants to sign a products liability reform bill. Legal reform has the broad support of the American people and strong bipartisan support in Congress. 
With each passing day, we are losing an opportunity to do the people's business by not enacting common sense legal reform. S. 648 is designed to inject some common sense into runaway punitive damage awards in view of the need for some semblance of uniformity in our National interstate commerce system. 
Last May, the United States Supreme Court held in BMW in North America v. Gore, that punitive damages can be considered so excessive as to violate a defendant's constitutional due process rights. It seems that many courts have not heeded this lesson. Just a few weeks ago, another case received national attention for the enormity of its punitive damage award. A jury in a Louisiana State court levied a $2.5 billion punitive damage award against CSX Transportation corporation and $1 billion against the other defendants in the case for their involvement in a 1987 tank car fire. The court awarded this enormous punitive judgment despite findings by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) that CSXT did not cause the accident and that no serious injuries resulted from the accident. 
In light of these egregious examples, it is time for Congress to pass legislation to reign in these exploding legal costs which have hurt American businesses, stifled ingenuity, and punished consumers through higher prices and decreased competition. S. 648 would mark an important first step in reforming a tort system which all too often better resembles a lottery than a forum of justice. I urge our leadership to make S. 648 a priority in the first session of the 105th Congress.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, yesterday, President Clinton held a press conference in which he outlined his reasons for refusing to sign onto the Oslo Land Mine Treaty. As my colleagues know, this treaty is intended to eliminate the horrible and very real carnage thrust on people of war torn countries by abandoned and old-fashioned land mines. The President said that the refusal of the signatories to consider our Nation's security requirements with regard to our use of self-deactivating, so-called smart mines, and our obligations to the defense of our loyal South Korean allies, represented a line which he simply could not cross for the good of the Nation. 
Honesty compels me to speak out when I disagree. It also demands that I recognize a person when he is right without regard to which side of the aisle he may occupy. I rise today to commend the President's act of courage in refusing to sign the Oslo Treaty, and for being willing to stand up and say we need to protect our soldiers when they have to be in the field. As we all know, the pressure on him to sign--especially during the last several weeks--has been worldwide, relentless, and most intense--even from his own party. 
Thankfully for our troops, the President understands the danger of taking this defensive weapon away from them. Thankfully for our troops, the President understands the importance of land mines to the defense of the hottest spot on the globe today--the Korean Peninsula. Thankfully for our troops, the President understands that taking smart mines away will not help one person in any mine-infested country in the world. Thankfully for our troops, the President understands that you simply cannot legislate the horror out of war. 
I commend President Clinton for his exercise of good judgment in the face of overwhelming public pressure to do otherwise. I also commend the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the many generals and admirals, both retired and active duty, including Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who have made their opposition to this treaty known. I commend so many of my colleagues who, during recent meetings with Canadian lawmakers, expressed their support for the President's efforts. Finally, I command Secretary of Defense Cohen, for his wise counsel. 
Regrettably, the effort to take this necessary defensive weapon away from our troops is still active. There is still legislation proposed that would do exactly that. But yesterday a battle was won in that struggle, and every American soldier, current and future, who might ever have to go into harm's way, and each mother, father, son, and daughter owes our President a debt of gratitude. He did the right thing for our country.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment to the bill that comes as a result of several years of involvement with the Indian gaming issue in Wyoming. I want to mention, you may have a copy of an early version of the amendment. I hope you have a copy of this more recent version. 
What we are trying to achieve with the bill is to be sure that the Secretary of Interior is not drafting any rules or regulations that would bypass the States in the process of dealing with Indian gambling. 
Now, that is what this amendment works to do, and I rise to join my distinguished colleagues, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, the Senators from Indiana, Senators Lugar and Coats, and the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, in offering an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. 
This amendment would place a 1-year moratorium on the Secretary of Interior's ability to approve any new tribal-State gambling compact if the compact has not been approved by the Governor and the State legislature of the State in which the tribe is located. This 1-year moratorium will give Congress an opportunity to review the approval process of Indian gambling compacts as well as the effect of gambling on the society as a whole. 
Mr. President, last year Congress approved the formation of a National Gambling Impact Study Commission to conduct a 2-year study of gambling's political, social, and economic effects. By authorizing the study, Congress realized the potential dangers that the recent explosion in casino gambling poses to society at large. While this study has yet to get seriously underway, the expansion of casino gambling is continuing at an alarming rate. 
The desire for quick cash has had an effect on everyone, including native Americans, and them as much as any other segment of the population. A Congressional Research Service report issued this past June showed that since the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in 1988, the Secretary of the Interior has approved over 180 tribal-State gambling compacts. As of June of this year, 24 States now have gambling on Indian reservations within their borders. Mr. President, 145 Indian tribes currently have one or more casinos on their lands. This proliferation of casino gambling on tribal lands and society at large has not been without its negative effects. John Kindt, a professor of commerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, has concluded that for every $1 in tax revenue that gambling raises, it creates $3 in costs to handle such expenses as economic disruption, compulsive gambling, and crime. Gambling is an industry in which a precious few make a fortune, while the penniless thousands pay the price with their shattered lives, painful addictions, and widespread crime. 
In light of the detrimental effects of the proliferation of casino gambling, Congress should review the approval process of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to determine what long-term changes need to be made to this act. While the regulation of gambling is generally reserved to the State governments, the power to regulate gambling on Indian tribal lands rests primarily with Congress. 
Let me explain precisely what this amendment would do. The amendment my colleagues and I are offering places a 1-year moratorium on the approval of any new tribal-State gambling compacts if the compacts have not been approved by the Governor and the State legislature in the State in which the tribal lands are located. This amendment does not prohibit the individual States and Indian tribes from negotiating class III gambling contracts. It simply requires if there is to be an expansion of the tribal-State gambling contracts within a State's borders, these compacts must first be approved by the State's popularly elected representatives and Governor. Again, this moratorium is only for a period of 1 year. A 1-year moratorium will allow Congress to reexamine the long-term approval process of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to determine if the current process is in the best interests of the tribes, the States and the country as a whole. 
The rationale behind this amendment is simple: Society as a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A State's law enforcement, a State's social services and communities are seriously impacted by the expansion of gambling, casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. Therefore, a decision of whether or not to allow casino gambling on tribal lands should be approved by the popularly-elected representatives. I believe a 1-year moratorium on the approval of new gambling compacts which do not receive approval from the Governor and the State legislature is a reasonable beginning to a very important debate on reexamining the long-term approval process under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort. Again, the amendment that we have presented would give a clear indication to the Secretary of the Interior that we do not want rules and regulations that will bypass State authority and put the State in a situation--since the gaming doesn't affect just the lands, just people on the tribal lands, it affects those immediately surrounding it to a great degree. The further you are from the gambling, the less impact there might be. 
But there is an effect on a greater number of people than just the tribe. In our State of Wyoming, we had an initiative about 3 years ago to allow local option decisions on gambling. When that initiative was first presented, according to polls, 70 percent of the people were in favor of allowing that local option. We took a look at the situations in the States surrounding us, what was happening, and when we had the vote, 70 percent of the people in Wyoming said, no, that isn't the way we want our State to go, that isn't the way we want our neighbors to inflict their decisions on us. So the State, as a whole, took an approach of not allowing class III gambling by 70 percent. That was with a lot of money against it. 
So we have some concern in our State. My purpose with the amendment is to make sure the State's concerns would be represented in this, as well as everyone else's. I mention that, with the first version I put out, I got a call from the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. He had some concerns. He thought I was trying to eliminate a particular tribe in a particular place in New Mexico. That was not my intent. I took a look again at the wording and changed it to the wording that has gone to the desk because, again, we want to emphasize that our purpose in this is to make sure that the States are involved in the decision as well. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I really appreciate the remarks of my distinguished colleague from Hawaii. I know of his long-time involvement in the Indian issue and of his long-time involvement in the Senate. In fact, I think he is the only person in the Senate who has been in the Senate since his State became a State. 
There is a lot of tradition, a lot of history, and a lot of specialization and involvement in this particular issue. I have to admit that in the last few minutes I have learned a lot about the issue. From talking to him earlier in the morning, I learned a lot about the issue. I also got an opportunity to talk to Senator Campbell. Again, I learned a lot about the issue. I have been involved in it before. But there was a different level of involvement, and these are people with a tremendous tradition and history on the issue. 
Again, my intention with the amendment that I presented is to see that the Secretary of the Interior does not bypass our process, that he doesn't write his own rules with the opinion, or believe that that can bypass some of the States' involvement in the issue. 
I do think that for the friendship and cooperation that has been built up in some of the States over the years, that this is an issue that still has to have the States' involvement. That is the only way that people can live together and work together and make sure that the Indian interests and some of the Indian problems are solved along the way. 
I appreciate the Senator's comments about the fact that only about 10 of the casinos are in a situation where they are making a lot of money. I have visited some of the reservations where the casinos are and have noted the disappointment by the tribal members over how poorly their casino was doing. I have seen that on nontribal casinos as well, because I followed the Colorado situation where the small businessmen in the small towns that were allowed to do the class 3 gaming looked forward to the time that they would be wealthy from gambling. They found out that it takes some different talents than they had as small businessmen to run a big casino. So, they didn't make the money that they had anticipated on it either, although there is a lot of money being made in a lot of places on gambling. 
My intent on this is to make sure that the States are a part of the process. The Senator mentioned the hearing that is coming up. I really appreciate the fact that he is going to hold a hearing and cover some of these important issues. My amendment would not undo the hearing. All of the issues can still be addressed in that hearing. If a bill comes out of that hearing and it covers the issue of State involvement, or at least this issue of whether the Secretary of the Interior can expend money to bypass the State process, if that is in there, I would work to be sure that the repealer of this amendment is in that bill. I would work for that passage. I don't think there would be any difficulty with it. I don't know of anybody who would oppose it if that were assured as a part of that hearing process. 
So, I commend him for his efforts already on this and his willingness to hold a hearing, which, of course, was already scheduled and planned well before I ever even thought of an amendment, but his willingness to be sure that that issue is addressed in there. That is what I got from his comments. 
We want to make sure that where the Court may have made some things unclear, they are clarified, and, again, that the State involvement in the issue is not left out. People live too close together these days to have the tribes separate from the States on the gaming issue. 
Lastly, I will address the comments about federally preempting State laws. That would never be my intent. Anybody who has looked at anything that I have done in the State legislature or since I have came to Washington would, I think, agree that everything that I have done has been to assure States' rights. It is not my intent with this. As I learn, I make changes. 
I guess I would ask the Senator from Hawaii, if I made a change to the amendment, one that would, instead of mentioning the Governor and the State legislature--which I understand now in some States one has the authority, and in some others the other has authority, and in some States it requires both to participate in order to do it--if we could change the wording so that if it was approved by a State in accordance with State law in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, if that would be a wording change that would then make this acceptable in both places where I mentioned the Governors and State legislatures--because I would like to make this so that I am not preempting State law. I don't intend to do that and would be willing to make that change if it would make a difference.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, now that we have added the second-degree amendment to my amendment, I would like to conclude my remarks so we can move on with the other discussion that is so important to this appropriations bill. 
I do have to respond to some comments that were made earlier. I am not trying to do a piecemeal approach that will destroy what the Indian Affairs Committee is doing. I commend them for any activities they take. This is just a very small part of the appropriations, and it is to prevent the expenditure of any moneys by the Secretary of the Interior that would bypass the State's right to an involvement in this process. 
I really appreciate the offer for the hearings, the offer to bring witnesses, even so generous as to suggest that we could use 3 days. We have been on this for almost an hour and a half, and that is really all I need, and I have used only a small portion of that. I think we have talked about this issue to the extent that we can, because I have modified it to put it in a situation where I am maintaining business as usual. We are assuring that there is a State's right to involvement in the Indian gaming issue. That is the way it is at the moment, and this amendment doesn't make any change in that. 
There is some talk about the words `1-year moratorium' in this. There is a 1-year moratorium because this is an appropriation, and the appropriation deals with 1 year's worth of expenditures, but it is not a 1-year moratorium against the tribes being able to do anything. It is a 1-year moratorium against the Secretary of the Interior being able to impose himself on the process. The Secretary of the Interior cannot make Federal law. We do that right here in conjunction with the House folks. I am trying to make sure that we can keep that same process. So we are not really asking for a 1-year moratorium on Indian gambling. 
I heard the letter that was read, and I assume that letter was written before the changes were made here that I have allowed in this amendment. If that letter was written and still intends to be a part of this discussion, I have to say that I am offended. I am offended that the Secretary of the Interior wants to impose his will and a threat of a Presidential veto over business as usual that has already been passed by the Senate. 
That is not a role that the Secretary of the Interior can have. We cannot give him that right. That is our right. That is our responsibility. That is what we were elected to this great body to do: to make the law. He can suggest guidelines, and we already have a law that suggests how this process works. The amendment, as it is now written, assures that all States have their rights in this process and that the law continues the way it is now. I have sent the change to the desk. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, be made cosponsors of the amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to make some comments about funding the arts, and I rise in strong support of the amendment offered earlier today by my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson. I commend him for taking such an active role in the issue. It is an issue that people have very strong and very divergent feelings about. It is that divergence of opinion that brings me to the floor to support this amendment. 
In the House, it is my understanding that there is a majority in favor of eliminating funding. We will be voting on that, too. Senator Hutchinson is offering an alternative. He has done a lot of research on funding equity to meet the purpose of arts, of getting it out as divergent as possible across the United States, and we have not been doing that with equity. 
During the course of this debate we have heard example after example of successful and valuable local projects. We hear about Shakespeare in the Park and we hear about traveling museums, we hear about folk festivals and chamber music, and visiting artists. These are very worthwhile programs, and they yank at the rural heartstrings of both liberals and conservatives alike, but the survival of those activities is not the subject of this amendment. In fact, this amendment would strengthen those programs. 
The variety of approaches today alone for funding the arts shows that what we are doing has some major flaws, and there is a saying that if you keep on doing what you have always been doing, you are going to wind up with what you have, or less. 
Everyone in this Chamber is familiar with the past trouble surrounding funding for the national endowments. There are too many examples of poor judgment in the granting process, too many examples of taxpayers' money wasted on projects with absolutely no redeeming social or cultural value. There are also those who argue that art is subjective, that Congress should refrain from limiting expenditures in order to foster freedom of expression. 
This is not a debate about censorship. It is a debate about spending the people's money. It is a debate about who gets to make the decisions. It is a debate about who can most encourage art participation and who should make those decisions. 
Is there any reason why national panels are more qualified to fund art than State or local panels? If the strongest justification for continued arts funding is the value of local programs, then we should recognize that and strengthen what works, eliminating what does not. 
Last week the Senate took a historic step in the right direction when we voted to return K through 12 education spending decisions to the local school boards. That vote indicates a frustration we all feel with the abrogation of local decisionmaking authority, with the dissolution of American democracy. Programming decisions, on programs such as education and the arts, must be subject to local sensitivities and needs. Federal bureaucrats have no accountability to people because nobody lives at the Federal level. People live at the local level, people learn at the local level, and people appreciate and produce art at the local level. Even the Smithsonian, National Gallery, and the Kennedy Center produce and display collections of local art. So if we are going to fund our cultural resources with taxpayers' dollars, then let us give the taxpayers the opportunity and the responsibility to do it right. 
In my hometown of Gillette, for example, where I served as mayor for 8 years, we are particularly fond of Camplex--the Campbell County Arts and Activities Center. Representatives from all over northeastern Wyoming take advantage of the performances and exhibits offered at Camplex, and many of those productions are made possible using Wyoming Arts Council support to leverage additional matching funds from local, State, and national sources. In fact, they leverage the resource about 10 to 1. That is local participation, local approval, and local decisionmaking. 
I understand the importance of arts and humanities funding in places like Wyoming. I know about the distances between small 
towns that would never get to participate in the arts if it were not for some funding that helps to get it to them over those distances. 
Seeing the arts encourages the talent that lives there. It brings out the talent of the kids, and we do have some very talented kids. Every Senator in this Chamber could point to some successes in their States. There is some misconception out there that conservatives do not appreciate the value of the arts and humanities in our society, but that is not an accurate view. This conservative Senator believes there is a place for arts funding, but that place is not in Washington. This is about an equal chance throughout the United States for equal funding in the arts. 
I congratulate the Senator from Arkansas for his middle of the road approach, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend, the Honorable Senator from Indiana, Richard Lugar, in the submission of a resolution declaring September 26, 1997, Austrian-American Day. We are also joined by many distinguished colleagues from both sides of the aisle in support of this measure to commemorate and celebrate the strong ties that bind the Government of Austria and the United States and our people. This resolution has deep meaning to me because of my Austrian roots and heritage. 
The year 1997 has special significance in the history of Austrian-American relations for it marks the 50th anniversary of what became known as the Marshall plan. It was 1947 when Gen. George C. Marshall outlined his vision of a program to rebuild war-torn Europe through a policy of reconciliation and compassion. The Marshall plan that was eventually implemented by the United States is remembered fondly by the free nations of Europe for its monumental and generous aid that gave the people of these nations hope after the most costly war in the history of the world--hope for freedom and lasting piece. Without the incredible vision of General Marshall the democracies of Europe might have floundered in their rebuilding efforts, creating an avenue for the expansion of communism in the midst of the cold war. Marshall's foresight and the willingness of the people and the Government of the United States to assist all of free Europe, especially Austria, resulted in the growth of stable governments in these countries. 
Austrians have not forgotten the efforts of the United States to maintain the unity of their country after World War II. The United States was instrumental in calling for a conference to be held in Vienna to debate the future of Austria. On September 26, 1945, this conference was convened between the Allies and the representatives of the nine Austrian Federal States, during which a treaty was signed that rescued Austria from a fate similar to that of the Soviet-occupied European countries and a divided Germany. 
The resolution I propose today, commemorates the sacrifices Americans made for Austria after World War II, as well as contributions that Austrian immigrants and Americans and Austrian decent have made to the American way of life in industry, education, government, culture, and the arts. Austrian-Americans that have earned the Nobel Prize include Victor Franz Hess in physics, Karl Landsteiner in medicine, and Friedrich von Hayek in economics. Austria has produced the likes of United States Supreme Court Justices Felix Frankfurter and Earl Warren; the originator of the Pulitzer Prize, Joseph Pulitzer; John David Hertz, the founder of today's Hertz-Rent-A-Car and the well-known Yellow Cab system; Estee Lauder, maker of leading cosmetics; and Raoul Fleischman, cofounder of the New Yorker magazine and member of the Fleischman yeast family. 
Through the years, Americans have also enjoyed the work of those Americans of Austrian descent or origin, such as Fred Astaire, Billy Wilder, and of course `The Terminator,' Arnold Schwarzenegger. This is but a small sample of the names to be found on a list of famous Austrian-Americans who have made heartfelt contributions to the legacy of the America they love. 
Austria and the United States have shared these common ideals and interests, not just in the past 50 years, but for nearly two centuries. It is for these reasons that I feel it is altogether appropriate that we recognize not only the proud people of Austria, but the warm and cordial relations that exist between our two countries at this historic time that holds such deep meaning for both our nations.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I do not have very many remarks on this but my remarks have grown just since I have been here this morning. 
I am fascinated with this accusation that my fellow Senator from Alabama is doing this on behalf of the tobacco folks. I have not seen him do anything that has looked like it was on behalf of the tobacco folks in this settlement. I have not done anything on behalf of the tobacco folks in this settlement, and during my campaign, even though I was desperate for money, I didn't accept any money from the tobacco folks. 
I am in support of the second-degree amendment and I am in support of the first-degree amendment. I am in support of both of them because they both leave all the money on the table. That is kind of hard to determine. We do not know at this point what the money is that is on the table. The Senator from Kentucky last night went through quite a discussion of how much it might be in addition to $368.5 billion, but this debate is about how much less than $368.5 billion it might be. 
Quite frankly, I am fascinated with the whole discussion on the tobacco settlement. I hear these comments about whether it is constitutional to limit attorney's fees or not. I cannot tell you for sure that it is constitutional for us to be talking about a tobacco settlement at all. This is an arrangement that the States entered into, through some lawsuits, and then some discussions, and now they are asking us to seal the deal on their behalf. Usually they are asking us to keep our hands out of their business, and I am in favor of doing that. I think the States have some rights that we have infringed on for a long time and that it is our job here to return as many of those rights to the States as we possibly can. 
So now we have the States saying, `Please meddle in our affairs and seal this deal for us.' Quite frankly, I am not hearing them say, `Meddle in this deal but don't meddle in the attorney's fees.' They are not saying that. We are not even sure what the attorney's fee arrangements are between the different States. 
If we have a constitutional right to do one, seal the deal, I think we have a constitutional right, too, to make sure that we understand what the attorney's fees are. 
When this passes it will not be the final time that it will be debated. There will be a conference committee on it and one of the things I have learned in the short time I have been here in the Senate is that those conference committees can do almost anything they want. When this particular amendment comes back it can have eliminated every concern of the people in the House and the Senate. Everything we have debated here can be changed or it can be left out. 
I think at this point it is extremely important that we talk about the attorney's fees and not let everybody in the country go running off to hire more attorneys at whatever rate they can entice them. Quite frankly, I think this 
could turn into one of the biggest lotteries in the United States. I think we need to have some parameters. 
Now, the parameter that is in this amendment is $5 million, or $250 an hour for each and every hour they put in the process. It was mentioned just a little while ago that you have to have people read the documents and determine what is important out of several million documents. Well, each and every one of those people reading those documents would get $250 an hour, not just the lead attorney, and him having to separate it out to the people reading the documents for him, everybody gets $250 an hour. That is quite an economic boon. The only limitation on it is $5 million per State. 
Do you think these people went out and obtained $5 million worth of State money or even suggested that attorneys ought to be able to get that through a contingency fee? If they did do that, why are they turning around and asking us to confirm what they did, but saying, `We cannot give you the details?' This amendment will bring out the details, and it is not the final action. The first-degree amendment brings out the details. 
We found that there was a stipulation in the last conference report--it was not an action we took, it was a conference report action--that there would be a credit against the tobacco tax, and we say, no, we will put that back on the table. I am all for putting that back on the table. We are starting to commit settlement money without having a settlement, without having a deal and without knowing whether the money is for the Federal Government or for the States. It is too premature to make those kinds of deals. 
I commend the Senators from Maine and Illinois for their effort to get the cigarette tax back on the table so we can decide, and I commend the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, for putting the attorney's fees on the table so we can take a look at whether they earned them or not and what part they played in this process. It seems to me to be logical. 
Another little twist on this whole tobacco settlement is we are talking about several years of payments in the tobacco settlement, but we are talking about upfront, putting them out of business. There is not much clamor against putting them out of business, but you do not get money over a long term from somebody that you put out of business. 
We want to stop the cigarette sales. We want to get people to quit smoking and having the harmful residuals that are showing up from the tobacco, but are we going to give away the first money that comes in, the money that is most assured of having, to the attorneys? And then when we put them out of business, saying `What happened to the other $300 billion we were going to get out of the bill? How come we don't get the money?' We committed that money. 
So I certainly hope that the Senate will be careful and not commit money that we do not have, commit money that we do not understand how we are going to get, commit money that it may not be constitutional to take. But I do hope we will investigate and work this thing to the greatest benefit possible for stopping smoking and helping the health situation in this country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2014, the conference report on tax relief. Through this tax package, we can give the American people the first serious tax reduction package in 16 years. This legislation provides tax relief to families with children, it offers greatly needed relief for small business, and it encourages education and investment. Finally this legislation gives some relief to individuals and small businesses from the punitive Federal death tax. I commend the Chairmen of the Finance and Budget Committees and the other conferees for their hard work on this package. We must realize that we still have a long journey ahead in relieving the tax burden on American taxpayers and in simplifying the cumbersome tax code. 
Mr. President, our tax burden in this country is overwhelming. We tax income, we tax investment, and we tax savings. In fact, we have pretty well figured out a way of taxing a person from the time he gets up in the morning to the time he goes to bed. From the time you wake up in the morning and have your first cup of coffee, you are paying sales tax. When you get in your car and drive to work, you are paying gasoline tax. As you work all day to support your family, you are also supporting the Government by paying income tax. When you go home and spend time with your family and finally go to bed, you are paying property tax. If you decide to make a telephone call or turn on the light switch, you get taxed for that too. This taxation on almost all your daily activities goes on your entire life and to add insult to injury, we even tax you when you die. It is a tragic situation in this country when most people spend more money on taxes than they spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined. It is time that we relieve this tax burden on our Americans. 
Just as our tax burden is too high, our Tax Code is frustratingly complex. Like a critically-ill patient, the Internal Revenue Code is in desperate need of surgery. We have continued to operate our Tax Code with layer after layer of bandages while ignoring the gasps of the dying patient beneath. This complexity has often left even the professional tax preparers in a quandary about the meaning of the myriad of code provisions and revenue regulations. When even the experts cannot understand our Tax Code, it is time for meaningful reform. 
I had the pleasure of conducting a small business committee field hearing in Casper, WY, this past April in order to find out the concerns facing many of our small businesses. One of the consistent messages I received from the hearing was that the complexity of our Tax Code is strangling small businesses. Even the representatives from the accounting profession testified that our Tax Code is in desperate need of simplification. They are concerned about their own liability because they cannot even count on representatives of the Internal Revenue Service to understand the Tax Code they attempt to enforce. I have found that many of these accountants are reluctant to simplify the code, however, because every time we've attempted to simplify the Tax Code, we have ended up raising taxes. We in Congress must begin by reevaluating our tax policy. We will be able to accurately chart our course only if we know where we are going. 
This conference report takes an important step in lessening the tax burden on individuals and small businesses alike. This tax package provides broad-based tax relief for America's families. The $500-per-child tax credit would provide over $70 billion in tax relief for families over the next 5 years. The child credit has long been championed by the Republican Party as a means of helping in the evergrowing cost of raising families. Our Tax Code has failed miserably to keep up with the ever-growing demands of raising children. The current exemption for dependent children is less than one-half what it should be to keep pace with inflation. Many of America's families have two parents working with one working to pay the bills and the other working to pay the taxes. We should be working to strengthen our families in any way we can, and this credit will help in that effort. 
Mr. President, this package moves us a step closer to the eventual repeal of the punitive death tax. This is an area I have taken a special interest in since the Federal death tax adversely impacts a large number of small businesses and farms in Wyoming. The death tax punishes people who work hard their entire lives in order to pass something on to their children. This bill increase the exemption for individuals and provides for a $700,000 exclusion for family owned businesses. This exclusion was an important priority for me. I joined several of my colleagues in urging the conferees to include a provision which excludes the death tax for family businesses and farms. We need to build on this foundation and work toward an eventual repeal of the Federal death tax. 
Mr. President, this bill gets us closer to leveling the playing field between small businesses and their larger competitors. Most notably, it accelerates the phase in for the deduction of health insurance for the self-employed and it reinstates the home office business deduction. As a small businessman myself, I was pleased to see some tax relief going to those who form the backbone of our economy. 
This legislation also encourages education by providing tax credits for tuition and expenses for college and technical school training as well as tax deductions for the interest on student loans. These tuition tax credits will provide the means for many students to pursue a college education or receive technical training. The tax deduction for individuals who have already invested in college or graduate education provide tax relief for one of the largest investments many people will make in their lifetime. 
Mr. President, this package makes important strides toward encouraging Americans to save and to invest for their future. We currently have a dangerously low savings rate in this country, and this is due in large part to our current tax structure which not only taxes income but it taxes savings. This bill expands the availability of tax-free Individual Retirement Accounts to include nonworking spouses and it creates a new `super IRA' the proceeds of which can be withdrawn tax-free for purposes such as first time home purchases. 
We also provide relief for investment by providing for long-overdue capital gains relief. This bill cuts the top capital gains rate from 28 percent to 20 percent and reduces the 15 percent rate to 10 percent for assets held longer than 18 months. This reduction of the capital gains rate will benefit millions of Americans. A news report just this week showed that nearly one-half of Americans have some current investment in the stock market. Many companies have allowed their employees to invest in their future by buying stock in the company. Many of these employees have counted on this investment for retirement. This package provides relief for people who have planned wisely for their future. 
Mr. President, I support his tax relief proposal because I believe we need to return some of the Americans' money back to them this year. This legislation will return over $90 million to those who have paid the taxes. It has been far too long since Congress has passed a tax relief package for the American families and small business, and I applaud this effort. We must not, however, believe that our work is done. Rather, it has just begun. We must now focus our attention and effort on the reducing the enormous complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. We need to set our sights on the clearly defining our Nation's tax policy, and then muster the reserve to implement our goals with simplicity and fairness. As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I fully realize the need of reforming a tax code so that it strengthens families, encourages enterprise and thrift, and rewards savings. I look forward to working with my colleagues in this most important endeavor. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is a great personal pleasure for me to express my congratulations to Ambassador Edward Ghehm, Jr. as the Senate completes its action on his nomination to be Director General of the Foreign Service. I have known Edward Ghehm, or Skip, as his friends call him, since the days when we were in college together. He and I were college roommates for 3 years. Skip has been a brother to me since we first met. I know him better than any investigator could hope--and there isn't anything I know I wouldn't share, from his sense of humor to his work ethic. Skip has always put God and Country first. He has lived a motto that says, `If what you did yesterday still seems important, you haven't done much today.' 
It doesn't seem all that long ago, we were both attending George Washington University here in the Nation's Capital. We used to dream about the future. I can tell you, we never dreamed that `someday' we'd both be before a congressional panel, me as the junior Senator from Wyoming, and Skip as the President's nominee for a key State Department post. 
Through the years, we have kept track of each other. I have been very proud, but not surprised, that Skip has gone on to accomplish great things in his career with the State Department. I've lived around the world through my brother. 
Skip has been a man for our time. A quick glance at Skip's duty sheet will show that whenever there has been a `hot spot' in the world community that warranted the careful attention of the State Department and a search for `the right one'--someone with a great sensitivity to a tense foreign situation and strong diplomatic skills to help find a solution--Skip was often the one they called. 
To name a few of his tours of duty with the State Department, Skip has served in the Vietnamese Embassy, he has been in Nepal, and he has been stationed in many posts in the Middle East. 
Skip was a part of the team that negotiated hostage releases. He has been in charge of evacuating Embassy families. Each change of administration has sought out his expertise, his counsel, and his active participation in our foreign policy. When Operation Desert Storm became necessary, once again Skip was there, serving as our Ambassador to Kuwait. You'll remember the proud moment when the American flag went back up at our Embassy--Skip was the person you saw raise the colors. 
Most recently, Skip has been serving as the Deputy U.S. Representative to the United Nations. 
Ambassador Gnehm is a man of great character, strongly held principles, and the greatest integrity you could hope to find. He has earned the respect of those he works with, and his counterparts in the foreign countries and Embassies in which he has been assigned. 
Skip is the perfect choice for the Foreign Service. He has always seen the foreign service as his best chance to serve--to make a difference. And he has made a difference. He has the experience and the determination it takes to succeed. He's a proven leader who understands the need to follow orders and the direction of our foreign policy. He possesses the finest of administration skills. I have no doubt that the wealth of talent he possesses will enable him to lead with confidence. As always, Skip will do a fine job and produce results. 
It is with great pleasure that I support his nomination.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution offered by the senior Senator from West Virginia and the junior Senator from Nebraska, of which I am a cosponsor, and which concerns the issue of global warming in general and the impending related treaty specifically. 
Mr. President, many of us are not surprised by the content of this proposed treaty. We saw the 1992 Framework Convention on Global Climate Change for what it was: The nose of the camel. And now, 5 years later and just as expected, we find ourselves face to face with the whole critter. He's in the tent, he's huge, and he's very frightening. 
The agreement signed in Brazil 5 years ago was voluntary. It called for the economically developed nations to undertake voluntary actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. Now the administration wants a legally binding agreement that will require a handful of developed countries to reach 1990 levels of fossil fuels emissions by the year 2010. But here is the amazing part, Mr. President: Though the United States and several other developed countries will be subject to the new enforcement regime, the rest of the world will not. Utterly amazing. Where in the world did this administration learn to negotiate? I see a lot of give, but I am still looking for the take. 
So we really believe we can place shackles on our economy, leave the economies of our trade competitors unaffected, and not lose countless jobs and industries overseas? It has been all we can do to stop the loss of jobs overseas under the best conditions. Every developing nation has cheaper labor costs than we do. Every developing nation has fewer environmental regulations than we do. Every developing nation has fewer worker protection expenses than we do. These nations are understandably concerned, first and foremost, with elevating the living conditions of their own people. Their leaders would be derelict if they weren't. Does anyone seriously believe they will not take advantage of the new regime at the expense of our workers? Is a little fairness too much to ask? Does the administration find the concept of simple equity so unreasonable? 
The AFL-CIO is apoplectic at the prospect of this ill-advised treaty, and with good reason. They understand how many American jobs it will kill. As a representative from the largest coal producing State in the Nation, I know only too well just what it means for the people of my State. This resolution simply calls for all nations to share the burden in the effort to avoid an environmental problem, which, I might add, is supported by a scientific consensus that is generously referred to as unsettled. 
This resolution, if adopted, would be a treaty enhancer, not a treaty killer. For this reason, if no other, the administration should embrace it. In its current form the treaty will most certainly not survive this body. We want a good treaty. We are not opposed to a global antipollution effort. But we want a fair treaty. You just cannot have the former without the latter. We need to bring developing countries on board in a responsible fashion. And if the Byrd-Hagel resolution is not adopted the administration will have missed a valuable opportunity to do so. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, many of us returned home to our States to celebrate the Fourth of July and the birth of this great Nation. All across this country, in both urban and rural communities, we joined as one to honor our Founding Fathers and their commitment to freedom as reflected in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Together these two documents form the foundation of our Nation. 
It seems most fitting and appropriate to take a moment after we have returned from our Fourth of July activities to take note of two groups of Wyoming students that came to our Nation's Capital recently as part of programs celebrating the history of our Nation and its place in the world. 
To celebrate the Constitution, and its effect on our lives as citizens, a team from Central High School in Cheyenne traveled to Washington to participate in a competition entitled `We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution.' In that event, students from across the United States competed against each other as they demonstrated their remarkable understanding of and sensitivity to the fundamental principles upon which this Nation was founded. They proved that the values that are embodied in our Nation's Constitution still resonate with meaning and importance in our lives today as they serve to fire our children's imaginations and interest in our past. 
In the process of preparing for this event, those students learned a lot about the Constitution. I would imagine many of them were surprised to learn that it is truly a living document. Through the years it has been changed and amended to address the problems of a growing democracy. It has weathered every storm, including a Civil War and countless crisis faced by our Nation's leaders. Through it all, it has continued to provide the guideposts we have followed to ensure that our Nation remains strong and free. 
It was very gratifying personally to see such attention focused on our Nation's Constitution. That document holds a great deal of meaning to me personally. 
I have always drawn inspiration from the words our Founding Fathers used as they drafted the U.S. Constitution. In fact, when I served as the mayor of Gillette, WY, I always had a copy in my coat pocket. I gave copies to the members of the council each year on Constitution Day and every other year we read it as part of our proceedings. 
Now that I have been elected to the Senate, I have to say it has new meaning for me. It refers to me. It is my job description. It is not just the basic rules for someone way off in Washington. It speaks directly to me and the purpose I serve as a Member of the Senate, a representative of the dreams, hopes, and ambitions of the people of my home State of Wyoming. 
Just a few weeks ago another group came to Washington as part of a program to promote and encourage our children's interest in and enthusiasm for history. We are all familiar with the famous quote of George Santayana, `Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.' 
That is why it is so important that we continue to encourage our children to study the past and learn about the mistakes that were made, and the triumphs, too, that have made this Nation what it is today. 
Looking over the list of subjects that those who participated in Wyoming History Day had worked on, I was quite impressed by the many different areas of history that had drawn their attention. I am certain they were all amazed by how much they had learned by examining the events they had chosen in detail as they prepared for the competition. 
Like those young students, I also enjoyed studying our Nation's history when I was in school. I was fascinated by the stories of our past, and I took a special interest in the history of Wyoming and the days of the Old West. I read everything I could get my hands on that had to do with the early days of the West and our State's first settlers. They were brave pioneers and together they faced a great many hardships and trials as they worked to make it out West. They were remarkable people blessed with special skills and strengths. The heritage they passed down to their children is still reflected in the faces of those who have a long history with and strong ties to the land they love and rely on for their lifeblood. Our grandfathers and great grandfathers passed down their great love of independence and freedom to us, and their lifestyles helped shape our character and made Wyoming what it is today: fiercely proud, independent, and strongly self-reliant. 
These programs are the kind of projects we should continue to encourage our children to pursue as a regular part of their education. By studying and reading about the history of our Nation and the world, we will not only learn how to avoid the mistakes of the past, but we will also learn how to properly plan and prepare for our future. Studying about the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and the work our Founding Fathers put into this great Nation at its conception is a good place to begin. What better time to take up this subject than now, so close to our Fourth of July celebration. That is what Independence Day is really all about. We take great pride in our history. We celebrate the lives and work of that relatively small group of individuals, banded together by their commitment to freedom, and the dream of democracy; and who saw the reality and reassurance of a new republic. On that day in July in 1776 they began a series of events that have served to change the face of the world forever. 
I am very proud of these and all our students who are studying the world's history, and our place in it. As the father of a schoolteacher, I know the commitment that is necessary to provide our children with a good education. For that process to be successful, we must all do our part--teachers, students, and parents. We should all continue to encourage our children to participate fully and actively in the programs and projects offered by their schools. The resulting challenges they will face and the rewards they will receive will have a dramatic effect on their lives. Congratulations to all those who won awards in these programs, and to those who gave their best efforts as participants. We are very proud of each one of you--and counting on you for the future.

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support for S. 1037, the Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and Educational Act of 1997--better known as the CIDCARE Act. I want to commend my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for his steady work on this important measure and for his commitment to enhancing the quality of child care throughout the Nation. I firmly believe that Senator Jeffords has crafted a measure that would stimulate the demand for higher quality child care and I am proud to join Senator Dodd as an original cosponsor of this bill. 
Our society has braved a storm of changes during the last five decades. Our Nation's work environment has changed, too, with the introduction of personal computers, high-speed modems, cellular phones, pagers, and fax machines. American suburbanization has created a need for audio and video conferencing, satellite offices, and most importantly, telecommuting. In addition, there has been an influx of women into our nation's work force. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 76 percent of mothers now work. Moreover, 63 percent of two parent households now see both parents working outside of the home. While the number of working women in our country continues to rise, so has the number of children enrolled in child care. Unfortunately, the quality of this care has not risen to match the rapid increase in enrollment. That is why we must modernize the way we provide child care assistance by allocating our scarce resources more efficiently. By doing so, our children will benefit. That is clearly an investment in our Nation's future. Congress must legislate with the times to provide opportunities for our Nation's parents and child care providers to make that investment. 
It is often the case with a lot of families that one parent works to pay the bills while the other one works to pay the taxes. A lot of people are working two jobs just to make ends meet, and often, both parents are working two jobs. The resulting increase in the number of employed women in the work force has dramatically expanded the number of child care providers. This expansion is truly beneficial to parents who need available child care, but the ratio of children to providers and the ensuing reduction in the quality of that care when staff and resources are stretched is still troubling. A recent nationwide study indicates that 40 percent of the child care provided to infants poses a potential risk of injury. Moreover, 15 percent of the care at center-based providers is so deficient that a child's health and safety are threatened. 
In Wyoming, the quality of the care provided to our children is taken very seriously. Child care providers licensed by the State of Wyoming must have 12 credit hours in education, CPR training, meet fire marshal standards, and have a minimum amount of floor space for the children entrusted to their care. The State ensures that all licensed providers comply with these requirements and would continue to do so if this bill is passed --but they would do so much more effectively. This legislation would provide a $260 million competitive grant program to assist States in improving the quality of care we provide our children. States must use at least 30 percent of the grant funds awarded to establish a subsidy program to provide salary increases to licensed child care providers. The remainder of the grant funds awarded could be channeled toward establishing a scholarship program to help child care providers meet the costs of education and training; expanding State-based child care training and technical assistance activities; improving consumer education efforts including the expansion of resource and referral services and child care complaint systems; providing increased rates of reimbursement provided under Federal or State child care assistance for children with special-needs; or even for purchasing special supplies, equipment, or meeting other expenses necessary for the care of special needs children. Moreover, this legislation would further expand the Community Development Block Grant to States to help renovate existing child care facilities. 
Equitable distribution of resources based on the percentage of income a family uses to meet child care expenses must be represented in any change to the current system. This legislation reduces, but does not eliminate, the dependent care tax credit for upper income taxpayers by changing the way the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit is administered. The income level for the receipt of the highest percentage of employment-related child care costs would be increased from $10,000 to $20,000. The percentage would be decreased at a rate of 1 percent for each additional $2,500 in adjusted gross income and a minimum percentage of 10 percent would be set for incomes of $70,000 and above. Employers would be allowed to contribute more to a dependent care assistance plan account. Moreover, families who qualify for the earned income tax credit [EITC] would receive a refund of the child care tax credit on a quarterly basis. The EITC was originally geared to assist families with dependent children--not couples without any kids at all. Clearly, changes are in order. 
Small businesses are fighting an uphill battle in meeting the child care needs of their employees. Having played the small business owner role for over 25 years, I can appreciate the need for giving such employers a break. This legislation creates a tax credit for employers providing, or otherwise supporting, child care arrangements for their employees. Fifty percent of the expenses incurred by a business to meet the child care needs of employees would be credited toward the business' Federal tax liability. Included in this provision are startup costs, renovations to meet accreditation standards, professional development for child care providers, general operating expenses, and subsidized child care for lower paid employees. Small businesses need incentives in order to be more involved in meeting the child care needs of employees. After all, Congress is placing more parents into the work force following last year's welfare reform legislation. We should provide some tax incentives to employers who are providing those jobs. 
This legislation would also authorize $50 million a year to establish and operate a technology-based training infrastructure to enable child care providers nationwide to receive the training, education, and support they need to improve the quality of care they provide. We must reap the benefits of the Internet to enhance the quality of child care. We spend a lot of time talking about how the Internet can be harmful to children. Here's a chance to show how it can dramatically help them. By creating a child care training and education interactive network, child care credentialing and accreditation entities for training, skills testing, and other activities needed to maintain child care credentials would be greatly enhanced. Moreover, a no-interest revolving loan fund will be established to enable child care providers to purchase computers, satellite dishes, and other equipment which would enable them to participate in the child care training provided by this technological infrastructure. 
The current system for funding child care in our nation yearns for improvement. This legislation does not reinvent the wheel, it changes the tires. States must continue to receive assistance in order to achieve a higher quality of care for our children. This legislation simply provides more efficient and pragmatic methods for administering that assistance. I believe that this legislation provides the proper incentives for enhancing the quality of care we provide our children. Our society's work force is driven by changing trends. I can comfortably argue that our society is one of the most trendy in the world--a fact that has kept America on the leading edge of technological innovation. I hope that before people begin making up their minds on this bill they will take a close look at the language and what it really calls for--better care for our kids. Our Nation's work force is calling for this much-needed change. I urge my colleagues to support S. 1037, the CIDCARE bill.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer a sense of the Senate amendment that calls for a repeal of the Federal estate tax on family owned businesses by 2002. I commend Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee on the progress they have made by increasing the estate tax exemption for individuals and by excluding the first $1 million family owned businesses from Federal death tax liability. I look forward to working with my colleagues toward repealing the death tax on family businesses. 
I introduce this resolution because I believe there is still much work to be done. The Federal death tax on family owned business tax punishes those who have worked hard their entire life building up a small business or a family farm only to have their children see it disappear in order to pay the Federal death taxes. The death tax discourages thrift and pierces the very heart of the American economy--small businesses. 
Mr. President, small businesses are the backbone of the American economy. The simple fact is that most businesses in this country are small businesses. Out of the nearly 5 1/2 million employers in this country, 99 percent are businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Almost 90 percent of those businesses employ fewer than 20 employees. Since the early 1970's, small businesses have created two out of every three net new jobs in this country. This remarkable job growth continued even during periods of slow national growth and downturns when most large corporations were downsizing and laying off workers. Small businesses employ more than half of the private sector workforce and are responsible for producing roughly half our Nation's gross domestic product. By punishing small businesses, the Federal death tax stifles our economy, discourages ingenuity, and threatens the economic security of many of our families. 
The Federal death tax also tears at the bonds that unite parents and children and families and communities. The family business has historically been one of the primary means for children to learn skills and virtues that help throughout their entire lives. Many of the small business in Wyoming are ranches and farms, and I know many of the hard-working 
men and women in Wyoming who run these family ranches and farms. The whole family pitches in to harvest the crops, feed the livestock, mend the fences, fix the irrigation ditches, plow the roads, herd the sheep and cattle, and plan for next year's yield. Children learn that hard work and responsible planning are necessary ingredients for success in work as in life. They learn respect for the land that is their livelihood. They learn to appreciate the labor of their parents and grandparents and they realize their own labor is an investment in their future and the future of their children. 
I myself ran a small family owned shoe store in Gillette, WY. We didn't have a separate division for merchandising and marketing. We didn't have an accounting department to sort out the complicated Tax Code. We all wore many hats. We had to sell the shoes, balance the books, keep track of our inventory, and straighten out the shelves. Let me tell you that we all learned to pitch in to get the job done. We learned to work together and we learned to appreciate the hard work and sacrifices each of us made to keep the store running smoothly. We also learned firsthand the importance of living by the golden rule. If you don't treat your customers well in the retail business they don't forget. This is especially true of folks in small towns where there are always a few people who remember what you did as a kid and who can even tell you stories about your parents and grandparents. The joy is, they also remember you when you treat them well. The family owned business is an important medium through which we pass on our heritage from one generation to the next. 
Mr. President, our Tax Code represents our tax policy and we should be ashamed at a code which punishes families and stifles our economy. Every year our Tax Code forces thousands of families to sell their businesses just to pay the repressive Federal death tax. It is time we correct this injustice by providing meaningful relief for America's families and their small businesses. I commend the chairman for his diligent work in crafting a tax bill that takes an important first step toward reforming the death tax. I look forward to working with my colleagues in repealing this burdensome tax in the near future. This sense of the Senate resolution expresses our firm intent to work together toward this end. I ask for your support in this important endeavor. 
I thank the chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12 noon. By previous consent, at 12 noon, the Senate will begin consideration of S. 947, the budget reconciliation bill. Amendments will be offered to the reconciliation bill today. However, no rollcalls will occur during today's session of the Senate. All votes ordered today with respect to amendments to the reconciliation bill will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, June 24, beginning at 9:30 a.m. Senators should, therefore, be prepared for a series of stacked votes beginning at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow. 
Under the rules, the budget reconciliation bill is limited to 20 hours for debate, and it is the majority leader's hope that the two leaders will be able to reach an agreement to yield back some of that time. 
Once the Senate completes the action on the first reconciliation bill, we will begin consideration of the second reconciliation bill, which is also limited to 20 hours for debate. 
The leader has stated for the past several weeks that Senators should be prepared for a busy week of session. It is the leader's intention to remain in session until both reconciliation bills are completed. The Senate will adjourn for the Fourth of July recess once we finish our business this week. But the majority leader warns his colleagues that we will remain in session into the evening throughout this week and into the weekend, if necessary, until the reconciliation process is completed. 
I thank all Senators for their attention. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate you and thank you for providing this opportunity for us to talk a little bit today about taxes to our colleagues and to the American people. I do rise in support of the tax reform proposals that have been offered by the Republican Congress. Yesterday I presided over 
the Senate for an hour and listened to an hour of Republican bashing on taxes. I am here today to proudly say that if it were not for Republicans in this body, we would not be debating tax cuts for the American people at all. We would only be talking about increased spending--not increased spending that the American people helps to decide on, just increased spending. And increased spending leads to increased taxes. 
So, I am proud to be working on a tax cut proposal for this Congress. The American people have not received serious tax relief for 16 years. Earlier this year I had the pleasure of chairing a committee hearing in Wyoming on small business. One of the groups that appeared there was the Society of CPA's. They asked for tax simplification and tax cuts for the American people. 
You might say that's kind of a strange bunch to want tax simplification, but I have to tell you it is so complicated that their liability is hanging out. It is difficult for them to meet the needs of the people. If you call the Internal Revenue Service on successive days with a tax question, you will most likely get different answers on that tax question. But they were reluctant to ask for the simplification because every time they have worked on simplification in this country, we have wound up with tax increases. That is one of the things we are here to guard against, is tax increases. And we are proposing a tax package that provides for nearly $85 billion in net tax cuts over the next 5 years. It is the first step in providing the American people with the tax relief they so richly deserve. 
This tax package provides broad-based tax relief for America's families. This is just the first step toward peeling back the monumental tax hike passed by the Democratic Congress and President Clinton in 1993. 
It should come as no surprise that the administration and many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle began bashing the Republican's tax proposal almost as soon as it was unveiled. 
A brief review of the last 5 years illustrates that this administration believes that a bloated Federal Government knows better how to spend your money than you do. President Clinton's tax hike in 1993 punished the American people by burdening them with more than $240 billion--billion--in new taxes. The President's tax increase was the largest in American history and it came after--after--the President had promised that he would offer middle-class tax relief. The Republican tax package would give Americans back some of the hard-earned money that was taken from them 4 years ago. 
We in Washington must never forget that we are talking about the people's money. As an accountant--and I am the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, which I like to humorously say probably accounts for the difficulty in getting tax cuts and balanced budgets--I hear people talk about how happy they are that the Government gave them a tax refund this year. I have to remind some of them that that wasn't the Government giving them a tax refund, that was them overpaying their taxes, the already overexorbitant taxes overpaid, and they were getting back their own money. We get confused, particularly in Washington, and we have to remember that we are talking about the people's money. 
Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle seem to have forgotten this. They apparently believe it is the job of the Federal Government to take as much money away from the private citizens as they possibly can and then set themselves up as a `committee of Government' who divides that money up to take care of everyone as they see fit. 
Mr. President, this is wrong. We should allow citizens to keep more of their own money and make their own decisions on how it should be spent. Government often purports to know more about our own needs than we do. But you know best how to spend your own money. History has demonstrated that the American people will use their money more wisely and more efficiently than we in Congress will. While they are doing that, they will be very compassionate, as well as constructive. 
The Republican tax package is aimed at providing broad-based tax relief for the majority of the American people. The $500-per-child tax credit would provide $81 billion in tax relief for America's families over the next 5 years. This idea has been championed by the Republican Party as a means of helping America's families. The President thought it was such a good idea that he has even campaigned on it. 
Many families today have two parents working: one of them works to pay the bills, the other one works to pay the taxes. We should be working to strengthen our American families in any way that we can. Taxes are our tax policy, and we should be disappointed and embarrassed by what our tax policy says. We should not be strangling American families with a punitive Tax Code that penalizes marriages. It provides very little tax relief for families with children. It punishes people with a further tax on interest income when they try to save for their kids' college educations or for their own retirement. To add insult to injury, we even tax people when they die. 
We kind of have this tax policy in the United States that if it moves, you tax it, and if it won't move, you tax it; when you buy it, you tax it; when you sell it, you tax it; and if you happen to die owning something, we're going to tax half of that, too. 
I listened to much of the debate yesterday by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who claim this is a tax cut for the wealthy. This claim has absolutely no basis in fact unless you play with statistics. I watched the charts yesterday. We should have truth in advertising on the Senate floor. We saw charts that indicated that people earning $30,000 a year would only get a $50-a-year tax credit. That is playing with the truth. They said that people who earned $400,000 would get $7,000 in tax relief. That is also lying with statistics. 
Take the $500 tax credit all by itself. If you earn $30,000 and you have kids, you would get a tax credit of $500 per child, and as I heard so eloquently explained earlier by my colleague from New Mexico, that is a tax credit. That means you don't take it off the income part of your tax statement, you take it off the taxes that you owe. You get to fill it out clear down to the balance first, and that is where you get the biggest tax cut. You figure your tax bill, and then you get to subtract from your tax bill this $500-per-child tax credit. 
I assure you that people who are earning $30,000, as most of you know, pay taxes, and if you pay taxes and you have kids, you get the tax credit, you get a $500-a-year credit for that child. That is quite a bit bigger than the $50 that was claimed here yesterday. 
If you take and lump everybody together, there are a whole bunch of people who are earning money who are not even married yet and don't have kids. They are looking forward to that tax credit, but they are not earning it. If you combine all of 
those, maybe you can get it down to an average of $50 per person who pays taxes in the $30,000 tax bracket. I would like to see a lot more detail on the kind of charts that we saw. 
We did pass welfare reform. That was the American people saying that we do expect people in this country to work and pay taxes. The credit would not go to people who do not pay taxes. We are not going to pay people not to work. What we are talking about here is the ability of the people in the United States to still enjoy the American dream. The American dream of owning their own home, their own car, to be able to be an entrepreneur; have an idea, go out and start a business and have that business grow into one of the biggest in the country. When they start that business, they are hoping that they can be doing it for their kids as well; that there will be money that can go to their kids. 
They are hoping to be able to pass some money on to the next generation. They are worried about their kids. I know a lot of people who have homesteaded in the West and spent every dime that they have earned off their farm or ranch to buy more land so that they would have land to pass on to their kids. Something interesting is happening out in the West, and that is, a whole bunch of people are moving into Wyoming from other States, and they are willing to pay a lot more for land than what the cows will produce on the land. The price of land has been increasing greatly. That is what they have to pay an inheritance on. They are taking away their ability to pass it on to their kids, a way of life, a way their kids anticipated earning money. 
I saw a program the other night about the new millionaires. Millionaires, we consider them to be rich. I can tell you--not from personal experience I can't--but from looking at people's returns, today's millionaires are not nearly as rich as years-ago millionaires. It is happening today, and the way it is happening is people who are working on assembly lines or in small business are taking a little bit of money out of their check--I know it is difficult to do--but they are taking that money and investing it, and when they get to retirement age, some are now finding because of these investments they have been doing for years and years, the business has been successful enough, they worked hard enough at their job to make that business successful, that the stock they bought is worth over $1 million. And then they die just at the time they get to their retirement, and the Federal Government says your kids aren't entitled to that, even though you worked for it for yourself and your kids all of that time. We, the Federal Government, are entitled to almost half of that money. We didn't do anything to help it, but we get it. 
The fact is that the overwhelming majority of the tax cut contained in the Senate's tax package go to middle-income families. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is Congress' official tax estimator, 74 percent of the benefits of the tax relief bill will go to individuals and families making $75,000 or less. Moreover, 82 percent of the benefits would go to families with educational needs, these middle-income families who were hardest hit by the Democrats' radical tax hike in 1993, and this is the group that is in most need of serious tax relief. 
What many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle really want to return to is welfare. They want to raise the taxes on people who are now paying taxes to give more money to those who aren't paying any taxes at all. That is not tax relief, it is welfare. Moreover, the budget proposal already provides for $1 2/10 trillion in spending for the next 5 years. The tax proposal would be a good first step in allowing families and small businesses and those who save to keep more of their own. 
We need to get beyond the misstatements and distortions and give the American people meaningful tax relief. As we prepare for the debate on the tax package next week, I ask my colleagues to join me in this endeavor. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, my amendment would ensure that American taxpayers get a fair deal when it comes to the $900 million this bill authorizes us to pay in dues to international organizations. My amendment would ensure that the United Nations does not spend U.S. taxpayer money to sponsor conventions that result in stricter--and more expensive--environmental standards for Americans than other members have to bear. 
I know the chairman has worked very diligently to ensure that our money is carefully accounted for by these international organizations. He has placed some strict limitations on the use of our funds, both at the United Nations and by the various international boards in charge of spending our money, but frankly, I would like those limitations to be a little more explicit. 
My amendment would prohibit the use of U.S. funds by the United Nations or any affiliated international organization to propose or promulgate treaties that impose new environmental costs on the United States--until, all other members of the United Nations have reached our level of environmental standards and enforcement. 
Many Americans, and surely my constituents in Wyoming, have a hard time understanding why we are writing a $1 billion check to international organizations and then exercising little oversight on how the money is spent. I ask you to consider for a moment, the accountability requirements we place on our own citizens when it comes to use of public property or receipt of Government payments. 
Ask a farmer what paperwork he or she had to fill out for the Farm Services Agency and the Natural Resource Conservation Service in order to get that corn or wheat payment last year-- or what bureaucratic tests disaster victims must endure to enlist support from the Federal Government. 
Ask an independent oil or gas producer how many reports they have to file with the Minerals Management Service or with the Bureau of Land Management in order to maintain a lease on Federal land. 
Or ask a small business owner what records they have to 
keep in order to prove to Government inspectors that they are complying with OSHA regulations and with EPA regulations--or to prove they are complying with the Family and Medical Leave Act or the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
Ask them how much it costs to have their taxes done. I raise these examples to show how much we expect of our own citizens. We place enormous levels of accountability on anybody who takes initiative in this country and we weigh them down with paperwork. We even hold them accountable to tell us exactly how much we will take from them in taxes. 
And then we turn around and hand out their money. We spread it around, far and wide. There are $900 million in payments to international organizations in this bill and there is almost no accountability. My constituents want fairness. 
I am particularly concerned by our participation in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and my amendment is drafted to challenge that issue, among others. I am pleased that the committee wants to require the administration to tell Americans how much the treaty is going to cost. Americans should know how much it will cost and who will have to pay for it. We are using their money to negotiate this treaty. Let's be honest with them. 
I think they might be surprised at what is being proposed. According to one independent estimate, complying with United Nations targets for greenhouse gas emissions could cost this country as much as $350 billion per year! That is nearly $1500 for every man, woman and child. 
And while you are adding up that bill for the folks back home, don't forget to point out that we could also lose nearly 5 million jobs directly related to energy use and production. Then there will be several million more that are indirectly related. 
That should make an impact on those hardworking American taxpayers in your home State. But I'll tell you what will really get them--when they find out that developing countries don't have to comply. Countries like China, India, Brazil, and Mexico will only have to report on their emissions, not do anything about them. 
All of this information may seem reasonable to some, but I will tell you, they don't buy it in Wyoming. International organizations should not be using American money to impose unfair requirements on Americans. 
I understand the difficulty the chairman has had with these issues and I recognize his efforts in this bill to restrict the taxation authority of the United Nations. I would like to direct a question to the chairman from North Carolina, if I may. 
Mr. Chairman, is it your belief that this bill adequately safeguards American taxpayers from any unauthorized use of United States funds by the United Nations or its affiliated environmental organizations?

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in light of the assurances I have received from the chairman of the committee, and from his staff regarding the Presidential reporting requirements contained in the bill, I will withdraw my amendment. 
I look forward to debating this issue again when we receive the Presidential reporting information. 
Let me say before I close that this bill is a good example of a bipartisan effort to reduce the size of the Federal Government by consolidating agencies into the State Department. Furthermore, reform of our policies with regard to the U.N. are long overdue. The chairman has shown great leadership in negotiating this important bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to again voice my strong support for S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I have listened to several of my colleagues speak about this important and necessary legislation. I want to especially commend Senator DeWine for his steady work in the Labor Committee and for Senator Ashcroft for the many hours he has spent working on this bill. 
I comment that today we have heard several speeches dealing with S. 4. We have heard several speeches that did not deal with S. 4. The other speeches dealt with a very important topic, too. They dealt with the disaster funding, but that was actually a filibuster against this bill. It was a request by certain people in this body that S. 4 not be adopted. They do not want people to have that kind of flexibility. It was a plea to do disaster relief, but it was directed to keep this bill from ever coming to a vote. 
Disaster is on the mind of everyone that is affected. One of the things I have discovered in my years in the legislature and since I have been here is that the disaster is in the mind of the one who is affected as well. Everybody has different kinds of disasters. The disaster that was talked about for a long time tonight is being handled in the conference committee right now. There is another disaster in America that is being kept from being debated in this body, that is kept from being passed in this body, that a vast number of people in this country need. It is a disaster that is happening to them. There are people out there that need more flextime and comptime to be able to spend time with their families. Some of those people are married to Federal employees. That Federal employee is able to take that flextime and the other spouse is saying, why can't I? 
In fact, in the early days when this bill passed that allows the Federal employee to do just exactly what we are talking about for the private hourly employees, the discriminated-against group, the private hourly employees, when we allowed Federal employees to do it we should have included the private sector at that time. We should have given them the same right that the Federal employees had. 
I know that in Cheyenne, WY, at the Unicover Corp., some of the people that worked in that corporation were hired by the Federal Government. They got flextime and they got comptime. I want to emphasize they got flextime and comptime, both of the advantages that are being talked about in this bill. Not just one, like is being implied, both of those advantages were given to the Federal employee. 
Their spouses said this is really a great idea. We should take it to our boss and get it implemented, and they took it to the Unicover Corp., they took it to the management and the management said, you know, that really is a great idea. We should do it, and they did it. Then they found out that they were in violation of the law. The Federal employees could do it, the private hourly employees could not. 
For 19 years the Unicover Corp. has asked Congress to pass a bill that would give them the same right as the Federal employees--not a different right, the same right. The same right for flextime, the same right for comptime. They are not asking for a special break that nobody else gets. They are just asking for an even break. Well, they found out they were in 
violation of the law and they had to end it. They have been working on it for a number of years to try and get it changed. I heard about it when I was campaigning and I said I do not know why we do not have that, and now I have a better idea why we do not have that. 
Today, the Small Business Advocate Award luncheon was held here in Washington, DC, over in the Dirksen Building. I had the opportunity to attend, and I got to meet the Wyoming Small Business Person of the Year, and there were small business people from all over the United States there, being recognized for the leadership that they have taken in their company, in their State, to make a difference. 
Marjorie Mathieson of Jackson is the Wyoming Small Business Person of the year, and I am very proud of her. That is one of the few manufacturing businesses in Jackson and it has been there a long time. They have gone through a number of different phases to keep current products that will sell to keep that small business in business. 
She talked to me a little bit about the Family Medical Leave Act. Some people have suggested that is an answer for all of the problems of meeting flexibility. Well, it is not. And it should not be expanded to be the answer to all of those either, because it is a paperwork nightmare, particularly for smaller businesses. Now, that is limited to businesses over 50 employees. There has been a request to bring that down to a smaller number. What we need is this Family Friendly Workplace Act that will provide the same kinds of benefits that we are talking about, bringing in the more complicated system, and bringing it down to a smaller level where they cannot handle the paperwork. 
A part of that business that the Wyoming Small Business Person of the Year runs is welding. They have five welders. Those welders make $40 an hour. Not bad. Five welders, $40 an hour. They want flextime and comptime. The business needs them to take flextime or comptime or both, and the reason they need them to take that is because they have work that has to be done. They have five welders. If one of the welders is to leave without doing some kind of a flex in the schedule, they lose 20 percent of their welding income. That is a significant portion of their business. That person loses $40 an hour. They do not want to lose $40 an hour. For overtime, they lose $60 an hour. They do not want to lose that. But the business can make arrangements for them to get flextime and comptime so that they can still have the time off, the revenue still comes into the business. 
More importantly, the paycheck comes to the individual. They want flextime. They talked to her about flextime. Marjorie wanted them to have flextime. She allowed flextime, and then found out that she couldn't have flextime, that she couldn't have comptime, that she could not offer this benefit to the people that worked for her. Jackson has some Federal employees. Those Federal employees get this. But these guys that weld can't have it not because the business doesn't want to give it to them, but because we have a law against it. And that is not fair. 
I have listened to the debate as we have gone through this topic. I am a certified professional in human resources. The Society of Human Resource Management, a national society, does education and testing in all of the areas of human resource management. When you complete the course and the testing, you can be certified as a professional in human resources. I have been through that process. They do an outstanding job of keeping track of the problems in the workplace. These are, for the most part, employees. I am not talking about employers. They are employees, employees who want benefits as well. And they see this as being a critical issue for the hourly worker in the workplace, a way for that worker to have more capability in their own scheduling. 
Everybody recognizes that this bill has provisions in it that both the employer and the employee have to agree to before it can be done. It isn't the case of forcing the employee to do it. It isn't the case of forcing the employer to do it. I am telling you, there are businesses across this Nation that want this and want it badly. And it is usually the employees that bring the idea to the employer and say, `Why can't we do this?' You know, they just do not believe that, since they know that the Federal employees get to do it. They just do not believe the employer when he says it is against the law. 
One of the biggest things raised in the hearing that we had was, `Well, you can be paid for your hours anyway. Then you can save that money from being paid for your hours, and when somebody gets sick, if there is a soccer match, if you want to go someplace, or if you want to have an anniversary, or any of those great things that people would like to have time off to do, then you can use this money that you save.' 
I ask you, how easy is it for you to save? It is pretty difficult. A lot of the people out there in the work force that we are talking about are women. They have gotten into the workplace because of some of the things that we have done back here. They have gotten into the workplace because of the way that taxes have gone up in the United States, the way that inflation has gone up in the United States. 
We have a situation now where in most families both people work. One of them works to pay the expenses, the other one works to pay the taxes. 
So it is not an option on whether they work or not. We asked a lot of women through the process in this thing why they didn't just bank the money and then use that money when they needed time off. And every one of them said to me, `When it is time that I am banking, it is mine. I can use it for my family. But if I accept that paycheck, if I take the money, that is the family's money. It has to go for all of those family expenses. And there are always family expenses.' 
But another unique part about this bill is that you can bank the hours and you can take the money. I don't know very many families in this country that do not come up with emergencies once in a while. If you have hours banked, there is a provision in this bill to be able to cash it in. So when the refrigerator breaks down and you don't have any alternative but to buy another refrigerator, even though it means putting off that vacation that you had planned, you can take some of the hours you have banked and cash it in. 
So they see this as a way to bank money for emergencies and to have time for themselves, time for themselves that they invest in their family. They really want to go to the soccer match. They really have to go sometimes to take their kids to the dentist. They like to celebrate those anniversaries. And this is a bill that allows it. 
The biggest complaint that I have heard about this bill is that there is a cap on the number of hours that they can have, a limit. And they say, `Why do you have a limit on that--240 hours? Maybe my boss wants me to be able to bank more hours and maybe I have a bigger event than 240 hours.' 
So that is a complaint on it. We are not even proposing that be changed. But we are asking for some consideration of the bill. 
The American workplace is dramatically different than it was 60 years ago when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. We have all heard the stories about the dirty thirties from our parents. So I don't have to repeat them here. 
I will, however, illustrate how nice it was for Congress to pass that Fair Labor Standards Act to specifically address the numerous problems that existed back then. Cheap labor was abundant. Folks were awfully hungry for work. And there were 
many employers who took advantage of a bad economic situation. The 40-hour workweek did not exist. Overtime did not exist. Child labor was being exploited. There were some problems that stemmed from the trends of that era. 
Under the circumstances, Congress acted, and acted appropriately, by passing the Fair Labor Standards Act. We are never going back to that. There is no suggestion of ever going back to that. But there is fine tuning that needs to be done. 
It is important to illustrate how times have changed since the 1930's and why it is the responsibility of Congress to legislate for the present with the future in mind. As a certified professional in human resources, I have had the exhausting and daunting task of filling out the federally mandated forms and paperwork. I have worked one-on-one with my employees to try to meet their needs. Through it all, I have always found my employees to be well schooled and extremely intuitive. As a result, they inherently understand how the modern workplace functions. And the smaller the business, the better they understand how it works, the more connected they are to realizing that the success of that business and the time they spend there means their job and the way they work there means their job. They don't need someone to hold their hand and show them the way things work. That might have been the case 60 years ago. 
I certainly don't view employee knowledge as a problem, but rather welcome it as an important addition to the mix. Employers have every reason to reward employees who clearly understand how to use their time in the workplace to its full advantages. America's working parents want to decide for themselves whether or not they want overtime or paid time off. This is a modern day reality that requires a modern day legislative fix. This act does not eliminate overtime pay, nor does it eliminate the 40-hour workweek. That kind of talk is simply nonsense. These things will stay just where they are, and the Family Friendly Workplace Act guarantees that. 
Before coming to the Senate I was the owner and operator of a small business for 27 years. Folks in Washington, of course, have a completely different sense of what constitutes the small in small business. I have had several discussions back here about whether a small business is 500 employees or 125 employees. I can tell you that is not even close anywhere in America. A small businessman is one who sweeps the sidewalk and cleans the toilets and waits on customers. He does it all. He has to do it all. 
We held a small business hearing in Casper, WY, early this year. I was real pleased to have the honor of chairing that in Casper. We had about 75 to 100 people show up for that, rotating out and others rotating through. When it was over, one of the news media people said to me, `How come you didn't have a better turnout?' I said, `That was a great turnout for a daytime hearing.' Because we are talking about small businessmen. Quite frankly, they are different than big business because in small business, if they had one person that could take off for that day to just listen to a hearing, they would probably fire them because it would be one too many people. That is small business. 
So that illustration is radically different from that of a big business that has the financial and the employer resources to institute very sophisticated job training and flexibility problems that sidestep the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. And that is being done now. There are ways, very complicated ways. But if you can afford the attorney fees and have the specialists, you can provide this for some of your employees--not all of them. But this bill will allow the small business person to have the big business advantage, that extra flexibility. 
Sadly enough, small businesses are further behind under the flexibility of this 60-year-old antiquated law. That is a further reason for passing the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Personal computers, high-speed modems, cellular phones, pagers, and fax machines have all become commonplace in small business. Moreover, these popular commodities have paved the way for telecommunicating, telecommuting--a work environment that could not have been envisioned 60 years ago. 
While the number of working women in our country continues to rise, so does the number of telecommuters and in-home businesses. A lot of businesses are being started in the home. Then when they expand bigger than the home can handle, they become an outside business. But there are a lot of them working in the home that will be the future successes in this country. It will be the future opportunity for people who want the American dream. They will start a small business in their home. It is happening because of the growing trend of spending more time at home with our families. If they telecommute, they don't have to spend an hour each way driving. 
That is part of the flexibility. That is something that the modern age has provided us. It is impossible to bottle up workplace flexibility. But we have an antiquated law that is suggesting that we can. That is why it is so important to modernize this archaic Federal law that squelches any chance of 
giving American hourly workers more time at home with their kids, a true investment in our Nation's future. 
Congress must legislate with the times to provide the opportunities for our Nation's parents to make that investment. It is often the case with a lot of families that both parents work. They do this, and they do it happily because they have to meet the bills. They also do it because they cannot get extra hours off from the job the way they would really prefer to do it unless they work for another business as well. If they work two jobs, they don't get any overtime. But a lot of them work two places. They don't get comptime. They don't get flextime. They don't get overtime. 
This unfortunate trend in the business world can be addressed by providing this workplace flexibility with the choice of paid time off for flextime. 
Times have changed and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 does not permit employees to choose between paid time off or overtime pay. My experience is that there are a lot of people out there who know that if they take the money, they will spend the money. They want the time instead. I also found that fact to be more prevalent among women in the work force. They feel the need for the time to spend with their children, and they understand that money belongs to the family. They have a much stronger family belief than most of the men I have worked with. So they prefer to take flextime or comptime and use that for themselves or their family. 
One of the businesses I worked for often had additional assignments that employees could take on, if they chose to do so. When we asked if the employees wanted additional work, they said `yes,' if they could have time off the following week with compensation, but if they could only choose to be paid, they didn't need it. They would rather have the time off this week than to take the money next week. We explained to them that they had the capability of taking the overtime pay, not working the following week, and spending that extra pay that week. But somehow those paychecks don't get distributed at home quite the same way they do on paper or here. 
I am hoping that everyone will reflect a bit on the trends that our modern work force is talking about and not the mandatory things that seem to be implied by this legislation imposed upon us. The downsizing problems today are leading to less flexibility as well as families making less money than if they were doing the job they preferred to do, not the second jobs they are having to do without getting overtime because it is a second job. There has been a tremendous increase in temporary positions in this country. This has taken flexibility away from the families. It has taken money away from the families. This a modern day problem that requires a modern day solution. 
This matter cannot possibly be addressed by legislation that we have crafted to address the problems of the 1930s. We have taken care of those problems. We are not going back to that situation. But we need to adjust for the future. Indeed, our society is constantly driven by changing trends. I can comfortably argue that our society is one of the most trendy in the world, a fact that has kept America on the leading edge of technological innovation. We have been at the peak in technology and at the tail in taking care of the hourly worker. 
I hope that before people begin making up their minds on this bill, they will take a close look at the language and what it really calls for rather than relying on misstatements, and I see those misstatements in the paper from time to time, misleading statistics, partisan posturing. Read the bill. Ask for a copy of the bill. Read the bill. It is amazing. 
Our Nation's work force is calling for this much-needed change. I again urge my colleagues to support the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Bring this to a vote. Give the hourly working people of this country the opportunity to choose how they want to work, the way that they want to choose to help their families. 
I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as one of the newly elected freshmen it is a great honor and a privilege to have this chance to extend my congratulations and best wishes to the president of the senior class--Strom Thurmond. A term of service that began on December 24, 1954, now enters the record books as the longest, and one of the most distinguished terms of service, by any Senator. 
Over the years, we have all witnessed Strom Thurmond's great successes in the Senate and back home in his beloved South Carolina. I think I have found the secret to his success, and I would like to share it with my colleagues. Simply put, Strom Thurmond listens to his constituents--otherwise known as voters--and he hears what they have to say. Then he brings that South Carolina brand of common sense back to the Senate as we tackle those thorny issues that come to our attention in committee and on the floor. Strom Thurmond has been doing that for over 40 years now, and it is clear that the people of South Carolina like his style. 
Anyone who has any doubts about Strom Thurmond's popularity back home need only check the record. There is no greater gauge of the strength of anyone's support in his or her home State than to see how you fare at election time. Again, Strom Thurmond has sole possession of the record for he is the only one who has ever been elected to the Senate on a write-in vote. Simply put, the people of South Carolina love him as much as he loves them. That is why they keep sending him back. 
Still, Strom Thurmond is not being celebrated and toasted by all of our colleagues because of his longevity alone. We take notice of his many years of service in the Senate, but we also make mention of our great appreciation of the wisdom, insight, and determined effort Strom Thurmond brings to the work of the Senate every day. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote a letter to Julia Ward Howe on the occasion of her 70th birthday. In it he said, `To be seventy years young is sometimes far more cheerful and hopeful than to be forty years old.' 
As we mark Strom Thurmond's legacy of service in the Senate, I think it is clear that no one is younger in spirit, more cheerful in attitude, and more hopeful for a better future for our children and grandchildren than Strom Thurmond. 
It is an honor and a pleasure, as the Senator who sits on the 100th rung on the current seniority ladder, to take this opportunity to congratulate the Senator on the top rung, Strom Thurmond, as he hits No. 1 one on the all time seniority list. 
From this day forth Strom Thurmond will set a new record every day he comes to the Senate. He has been a powerful and effective voice for his constituents. May he continue to do so for many years to come.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senate Concurrent Resolution 27, the Budget resolution. The budget resolution before us has gone through an incredible amount of negotiating to get to this point. I commend the Budget Committee chairman and the ranking member for working so diligently on this budget. 
As we began our work on the blueprint for our Nation's future, I had certain criteria in mind the budget resolution had to meet in order for me to support it. Unfortunately, this budget does not meet enough of my criteria to justify my support. 
I would like to take this opportunity to explain my position and those provisions which I feel leaves this agreement short of the mark. 
I feel that a good budget agreement should balance the budget before the year 2002. The Congressional Budget Office estimates a $225 billion windfall of unexpected revenues over the next 5 years. We should be giving this unexpected revenue back to the American people and use it to reduce the deficit. 
It also concerns me that there are no enforcement measures in place to ensure that the budget will remain in balance after the year 2002, let alone before that. 
Finally, the spending cuts are back loaded in the last 2 years of the agreement, and will take place after President Clinton leaves office. That isn't right. I believe the American working families expect action from us today--not promises for a better tomorrow. 
I voted for amendments that I felt would make the budget more enforceable and realistic. Without these meaningful amendments, the resolution does not go far enough. The amendments would ensure that the debt limit would not be increased, and that these additional unexpected Federal revenues and the projected $225 billion revenue windfall would go toward tax cuts and deficit reduction. 
If we don't produce a balanced budget, we lose, and generations to come will lose right along with us. A balanced budget only gets more difficult to achieve the longer we wait. 
If we are genuinely concerned about the welfare of our children, we should first look at balancing the budget while it is still realistic and possible for us to do so. The longer we wait the more we turn our children's dreams and hopes for a brighter future into a terrible nightmare. They look to us for leadership. They look to us to pass a budget that actually balances, and continues to balance the budget every year. I have no intention of letting them down. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which will enable Devil's Tower National Monument to retain its historic and traditional name. 
This, our first national monument, has been known as `Devil's Tower' for over 120 years. It is an unmistakable symbol of Wyoming and the West and is known internationally as one of the premiere crack climbing locations in the world. Consequently, Devil's Tower, and it's worldwide recognition by that name, is very important to my State, which depends so heavily on its tourism industry. And yet, there are those who would attempt to fix that which is not broken. 
I am fully sensitive to the feelings of those Native Americans who would prefer to see the name of this natural wonder changed to something more acceptable to their cultural traditions. Many tribal members think of the monument as sacred. However, I believe that little would be gained from a name change, and much would be lost. 
It is important to remember that there is no consensus as to which Indian name would be most appropriate. In fact, there seem to be as many proposals for new names as there are special interest groups proposing them. Among the candidates are Bear's Lodge, Grizzly Bear's Lodge, Bear's Tipi, Bear's Lair, Bear Lodge Butte, Tree Rock and several others. The only thing they seem agreed upon is what the monument should not be called: Devil's Tower.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am very pleased and proud to rise and speak in support of S. 765, the Safety and Health Advancement Act that I have sponsored. 
I thank all of the people who have been involved in the process of coming up with an OSHA modernization bill. You notice I mentioned modernization, not reform. 
There have been a lot of people involved in this. My colleagues, my staff members, and over 50 organizations have been involved in reviewing suggestions that we have had for modernizing the OSHA process. 
Over the last 6 years, there have been bills introduced by both Republicans and Democrats that wound up on the great scrap heap of unfinished business because they have been put in to make a statement, a political statement. 
For every time that a bill is put into committee, there is a committee report, an 8 1/2 by 5 1/2 inch booklet that lists a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of the bill, the majority opinion, the minority opinion, every amendment that has been suggested for the bill, and how people voted on it. 
We have gone back through the last 6 years of those bills, and we found on the issues that there seem to be common ground, and we have put those in the bill. We have looked for the issues that were conscientious that were dividing, and we found some new approaches for some of those things. 
We have not been able to address everything. But we have a bill that will help to move small business forward, that will give small business a better chance to have safety in the workplace for their workers. 
That is the main point of this bill. 
Again, I thank all of the people who have helped me on it, 
and I look forward to working with everybody on what I think will be a very reasonable approach that can go through both bodies and help out the workers in the workplace. 
For 6 year's Members on both sides of the aisle have seen the need for modernization. Unfortunately, its been approached each year as reform--and often as drastic reform. Big business and big union have seen the bills as an opportunity to make a statement--a political statement. The workers and small business have needed some clarification and a lot of help that has gotten lost in the statements. The issue of workplace safety and health is extremely important to a healthy America. Advancing safety and health in the American workplace is a matter of great importance and it must be considered in a serious and rational manner by Congress, by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, by employers, and yes, by employees too. This bill is overdue, common sense legislation. 
When I began my service on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I was surprised to discover the volume of documentation and resources available to us and our staffs. Each time a bill is reported out of committee, a 5 1/2 - by -8 1/2 booklet is made available to us that lists every detail about that bill--a luxury I never had when I served in the Wyoming State Legislature. Included in that booklet is a paragraph by paragraph analysis of the bill, with a majority and a minority opinion on each section. It shows every amendment, discusses them at length and reports who voted for and against them in committee. With this abundance of committee reports, I felt like a kid in a candy store. I just picked up 6 year's worth of OSHA bills and began reading. Surprisingly enough, I found that the things that business and labor needed to have done were pretty commonly agreed upon as necessary. Just the politicized statements separated the two sides. 
The fate of each bill was determined when such statements reared their ugly heads and squelched any chance of improving the safety and health of America's workplaces. Each year, legislators in the House and Senate introduce bills that appeal to a wide variety of special interests--setting the stage for a lot of mudslinging. These bills contained good ideas, but they eventually toppled from a barrage of political attacks--tossing them all onto the great scrap heap of Congress' unfinished business. It just goes to show that people who sling mud, lose ground. I found that both big businesses and big unions have made a lot of statements over the years, but statements don't become law and they certainly don't change things. Good legislation becomes law. It is time that we tuck the statements back into our coat pockets and start passing some common sense legislation that advances the safety and health of the American workplace. 
We all want a healthy and safe workplace. Legislation should therefore revolve around not what we want, but how to get there in a manner that is fair and equitable to all. There is no room for politics in the arena of human life. For this reason, I spent the last 14 weeks pouring the foundation for a new, comprehensive OSHA bill. This foundation does not consist of cement, but something stronger--the thoughts, suggestions and good ideas of employees, employers, and the individuals that govern them. I want to be clear that this bill does not 
include all the concerns of every interested party, but I do believe that it constitutes an important first step. 
This bill sticks to a theme-- `the advancement of safety and health in the workplace.' I am proud to say that it has been crafted to promote and enhance workplace safety and health--rather than dismantle it. We are addressing an issue that affects people from all walks of life. It is essential that we take each step with care. 
To be successful and effective, a well-crafted bill must provide incentives for employers and employees to act more responsibly. We need to make the profit motive work for worker safety, not against it. This spirit of cooperation must overpower political polarization if true improvements are to be achieved. OSHA must recognize that the vast majority of employers are not heartless and cruel. Having played the wage payer role for over 26 years, I take great offense when employers are characterized as Ebenezer Scrooges or Simon Legrees. The majority of employers cherish their most valuable assets--their employees. It is truly misleading and deceptive for anyone to say otherwise. For without the employee, management will ultimately have no staff, no profits--and no business. Watching out for employees is just good business 
When the Occupational Safety and Health Act was enacted 27 years ago, its intended purpose was to make the workplace free from `recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to . . . employees.' As is the case with many programs established by Congress over the years, OSHA strayed from its original mission of protecting people from occupational safety and health hazards through preventative measures. The focus has instead been heavily weighted toward and concentrating on penalties and enforcement. OSHA should retain the ability to punish employers who don't embrace workplace safety and health, but it should reward those who do. The carrot and stick approach has always worked before, but OSHA prefers using the stick by itself--and they rarely walk softly. I want to be clear that this bill does not dismantle OSHA's enforcement capabilities. That approach has been tried time and time again. But, enforcement alone cannot ensure the safety of our Nation's workplaces and the health of our working population. America would be better served by an OSHA that places a greater emphasis on promoting employers and employees working together and this bill would strike that balance. 
To continue the course set by Congress' original intent back in 1970, consultative services must be drastically expanded. My bill calls for that. Studies have shown that many sites where serious workplace accidents have occurred were not inspected by Federal OSHA inspectors for several years prior to the accident. This lack of attention to potential problem areas is due in part to an overemphasis on enforcement. If just the inspectors are working on safety, you can't possibly have enough inspectors. Everyone has to be involved. My legislation will allow OSHA greater flexibility in allocating its resources so it can give the most serious workplace problems its highest priority and most careful attention. 
This bill advances safety and health by allowing employers to actively promote employee/employer discussions concerning 
occupational safety and health hazards. Voluntary compliance by employers would be encouraged as part of the solution, not as part of the problem--as part of the prevention, not as part of the penalty. Employers would have the option of implementing an alcohol and substance abuse testing program in order to ensure a safe workplace. I have had the opportunity to see first hand the benefits of this type of program. I have been tested and given tests and I know about validity and dignity. Employees would be held accountable for misconduct in a site that has been determined by OSHA to be in compliance with existing regulations. Employees have the ultimate control as to whether safety toes, hard hats or safety goggles are worn. Employers would receive incentives from OSHA for utilizing the services of third party consultants. Moreover, continuing education and professional certification for OSHA consultants and inspectors would be required to ensure that the rapid advancement of technology doesn't surpass OSHA's ability to identify occupational safety and health hazards in the workplace. 
Not only have 6 years of OSHA proposals been reviewed, Meetings have been held with over 50 interested groups from the National Federation of Independent Businesses to the AFL-CIO. Contact has been made and some explanation given to every member of the Labor Committee. All suggestions received have been considered. Those that meet the goal of safety and health improvement without appearing contentious have been included. I am looking forward to a bipartisan effort to create the kind of workplace we want and need in America. This bill doesn't call for radical change, but it does start the progress and the process to safety. It makes changes small business can't wait any longer for. 
The Safety and Health Advancement Act represents a clean, fresh start to addressing the problems that affect OSHA, employers and employees. I am quite eager to work with each of my distinguished colleagues as this issue winds its way through the legislative process. By working together, we can return OSHA to its original course as envisioned by Congress when it crafted the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. I urge my colleagues to give fair consideration to this bill and I welcome your support.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. 
I am proud today to join the Senator from Pennsylvania and my other colleagues in voicing support for H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. I was an original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, and I commend my friends in the other body for passing this legislation by such a compelling majority. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take action and pass this bill by a margin that can withstand the President's threatened veto. 
Mr. President, we are debating an issue that has an important bearing on the future of this Nation. Partial-birth abortion is a pivotal issue because it demands that we decide whether or not we as a civilized people are willing to protect that most fundamental of rights--the right to life itself. If we rise to this challenge and safeguard the future of our Nation's unborn, we will be protecting those whose voices cannot yet be heard by the polls and those whose votes cannot yet be weighed in the political process. If we fail in our duty, we will justly earn the scorn of future generations when they ask why we stood idly by and did nothing in the face of this national infanticide. 
We must reaffirm our commitment to the sanctity of human life in all its stages. We took a positive step in that direction a few weeks ago by unanimously passing legislation that bans the use of Federal funds for physician-assisted suicide. We can take another step toward restoring our commitment to life by banning partial-birth abortions. 
In this barbaric procedure, the abortionist pulls a living baby feet first out of the womb and through the birth canal except for the head, which is kept lodged just inside the cervix. The abortionist then punctures the base of the skull with long surgical scissors and removes the baby's brain with a powerful suction machine. This causes the head to collapse, after which the abortionist completes the delivery of the now dead baby. I recount the grisly details of this procedure only to remind my colleagues of the seriousness of the issue before the Senate. We must help those unborn children who are unable to help themselves. 
Opponents of this legislation have relied on distortions to bolster their position. Just this past February, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, Ron Fitzsimmons, admitted that he lied through his teeth about the true number of partial-birth abortions performed in the United States every year. Mr. Fitzsimmons had originally joined Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League in falsely claiming that this abortion procedure was used only in rare cases to save the life of the mother. Mr. Fitzsimmons now admits that partial birth abortions are common and that the vast majority of them are performed in the second trimester--at 4 to 6 months' gestation--on healthy unborn children with healthy mothers. Mr. Fitzsimmons summed up the chilling truth of this procedure when he admitted that partial-birth abortion is `a form of killing. You're ending a life.' 
Opponents have argued that this procedure is necessary in some circumstances to save the life of the mother or protect her future fertility. These arguments have no foundation in fact. First, this bill provides an exception if the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother and no alternative procedure could be used for that purpose. Moreover, leaders in the medical profession including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop have stated that this procedure is never necessary to save the life of the mother. In fact, it is more dangerous medically to the mother than allowing the child to be born alive. Finally, a coalition of over 600 obstetricians, perinatologists, and other medical specialists have stated categorically that there is no sound medical evidence to support the claim that this procedure is ever necessary to protect a woman's future fertility. These arguments are offered as a smoke-screen to obscure the fact that this procedure results in the taking of an innocent life. The practice of partial birth abortions has shocked the conscience of our nation and it must be stopped. 
Since I was sworn in as a Member of this distinguished body in January, we have had the opportunity to discuss a number of pieces of legislation which will have a direct impact on our families and our children. I have based my decision on every bill that has come before this body on what effect it will have on those generations still to come. We in the Senate have deliberated about what steps we can take to make society a better place for our families and the future of our children. We as Senators will cast no vote that will more directly affect the future of our families and our children than the vote we cast on this bill. 
Mr. President, when I ran for office, I promised my constituents I would protect and defend the right to life of the unborn. The sanctity of human life is a fundamental issue on which we as a nation should find consensus. It is a right which is counted among the unalienable rights in our Nation's Declaration of Independence. We must rise today to the challenge that has been laid before us of protecting innocent human life. I urge my colleagues to join me in casting a vote for life by supporting the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. 
Now, I know there has been a big change in the approach to the whole situation by Mr. Fitzsimmons, who testified a year ago that this was not a common practice. I know now that he says it is common practice, and that is part of the debate that made a big difference on the House side, and I am convinced it will make a big difference on the Senate side, someone who is admitting that this is a common practice, that it takes lives and that he regrets what he said and what has been done as a result. I think that will make a difference in the vote we have over here, and I hope it will make a difference in the approach that the President takes to the bill. 
I would like to concentrate my remarks on the miracle of life. A year and a half ago, I had a torn heart valve and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. I had never been in a hospital except to visit sick folks before. I have to tell you that I am impressed with what they were able to do, but I have also been impressed with what doctors do not know. That is not a new revelation for me. 
Over 24 years ago, a long time ago, my wife and I were expecting our first child. Then one day early in the sixth month of pregnancy, my wife starting having pains and contractions. We took her to the doctor. The doctor said, `Oh, you may have a baby right now. We know it's early and that doesn't bode well. We will try to stop it. We can probably stop it.' I had started storing up books for my wife for 3 months waiting for the baby to come. However, the baby came that night, weighing just a little over 2 pounds. The doctor's advice to us was to wait until morning and see if she lives. They said they didn't have any control over it. 
I could not believe the doctors could not stop premature birth. Then I could not believe that they could not do something to help this newborn baby. Until you see one of those babies, you will not believe what a 6-month-old baby looks like. At the same time my wife gave birth to our daughter, another lady gave birth to a 10-pound baby. This was a small hospital in Wyoming so they were side by side in the nursery. 
Some of the people viewing the other baby said, `Oh, look at that one. Looks like a piece of rope with some knots in it. Too bad.' And we watched her grasp and gasp for air with every breath, and we watched her the whole night to see if she would live. 
Then the next day they were able to take this baby to a hospital which provided excellent care. She was supposed to be flown to Denver where the best care in the world was available, but it was a Wyoming blizzard and we couldn't fly. So we took a car from Gillette, WY, to the center of the State to Wyoming's biggest hospital, to get the best kind of care we could find. We ran out of oxygen on the way. We had the highway patrol looking for us and all along the way, we were watching every breath of that child. 
After receiving exceptional care the doctor said, `Well, another 24 hours and we will know something.' After that 24 hours there were several times we went to the hospital and there was a shroud around the isolette. We would knock on the window, and the nurses would come over and say, `It's not looking good. We had to make her breathe again.' Or, `Have you had the baby baptized?' 
We had the baby baptized in the first few minutes after birth. But that child worked and struggled to live. She was just a 6-month-old--3 months premature. 
We went through 3 months of waiting to get her out of the hospital. Each step of the way the doctors said this isn't our doing. It gave me a new outlook on life. Now I want to tell you the good news. The good news is that the little girl is now an outstanding English teacher in Wyoming. She is dedicated to teaching seventh and ninth graders English, and she is loving every minute of every day. The only problem she had was that the isolette hum wiped out a range of tones for her, so she cannot hear the same way that you and I do. But she can lip read very well, which, in the classroom, is very good if the kids are trying to whisper. But that has given me an appreciation for all life and that experience continues to influence my vote now and on all issues of protecting human life. 
When I first came to the Senate, we talked about cloning. I thought cloning had been going on for a long time. Of course, we used to call it identical twins, and it was pretty unpredictable. But I want to tell you, through all of that cloning, nobody produced life. They took life and they changed it. 
Life is such a miracle that we have to respect it and work for it every single day in every way we can. I think this bill will help in that effort, and I ask for your support for this bill. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first I want to commend the Senators and staff who have committed so much time to the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. It is a good bill that incorporates the insights and experiences of the hundreds of groups who have been involved in the development process. I planned to offer my strong support, however, for the amendment that was to have been offered by Senator Gregg because I believe the underlying bill would be better if it contained a strong commitment on Federal funding--for a number of reasons. 
I am familiar with education spending at the State level because I come to this process as a former State Legislator. I served the State of Wyoming for 10 years--5 years in the State House and 5 years in the State Senate. During that time, in my tenure as chairman of the Senate Revenue Committee, I felt all of the constraints in the State budget. The most difficult one, however--the one that was always fraught with protestation and controversy--was how we spent money on education, where it came from and where it went. Elementary and secondary education is my State's largest single expenditure. 
In the 1995-96 school year, the Wyoming State Government expended $237 million, or 44 percent, of the total amount of money spent on K-12 education in Wyoming. Fifty percent of the funding, or $280 million, came from local sources. I am proud of that commitment. The people in my State invest over $5,800 per student, per year, and that is the second highest amount in the country as a percentage of State income. But let me focus for a minute on the other 6 percent--the Federal contribution. 
Federal support for elementary and secondary education is a sensitive issue in Wyoming. Federal dollars always come with Washington strings attached and that is a problem for me and for a great number of my constituents. I believe we should leave more of our tax revenue in the States and let the people who live there make the decisions about education. 
Special education is different, however, because the strings are already in place. The distinction is that they don't come with much money. Wyoming's State and local taxpayers spent $58 million for special education last year. That was matched by only $5 million in Federal funds--about 8 percent. 
Mr. President, IDEA is a good law. It protects disabled kids from discrimination in public education. It is an issue that needs national attention, coordination, and support. We should recognize why this law exists, why these services are mandated, and understand why there should be an assurance of strong Federal funding. The Gregg amendment would have made that commitment. It would say that we, as a body, believe the Federal Government should pay more for special education. 
Why is this amendment so important? Because Congress has failed to support its share of the cost for 20 years. Without this amendment, the States really have no reason to expect that the situation is going to change. To add insult to injury, the bill places a new maintenance of effort requirement on State education agencies. That is a difficult pill to swallow when the Federal maintenance of effort has been so clearly lacking. 
I would have objected to the new State maintenance of effort because my State currently pays 85 percent of special education costs. The local relief provided in this bill will do little to offset the State's heavy burden. The bill does, however, allow for a waiver if the State can show it is providing all kids with a free appropriate public education. That is an important consideration and I think it adds enough flexibility to the law to make it acceptable. But it does not solve all the problems. 
This legislation will also require States to provide some new services. Without a guarantee of additional Federal funding, the States are going to have to bear that cost. One expense will be the mandate to provide alternative education for kids who are expelled due to disciplinary problems. There is also a requirement to provide State mediation as an alternative to due process. I support these changes. I hope they will actually reduce costs in the long run. But if we cannot even pay the Federal share for current mandates, then we should not be adding new ones. Congress needs to ante up the Federal share. If we are unable to do that, then this bill loses some of its luster. 
The Gregg amendment would have made that commitment. I understand the problems a conference might present on this bill. I sympathize with Members who have spent so many hours working to reach consensus, but I believe the Gregg amendment is important enough to deserve conference consideration. 
Mr. President, I do support the bill. It makes some sorely-needed improvements to the law--particularly in the areas of discipline, State coordination, and legal fees. We have before us a compromise that will improve current law, but it still lacks a strong funding resolution. That would have been an important part of this legislation that I think members of both parties would have supported. 
If we are going to help States live up to their responsibility in providing a free appropriate public education to all kids, then we need to do it. And that means more than just piling on regulations.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today not only as a proud original cosponsor of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, but also as a parent of three wonderful children. I am a working parent of three wonderful children. Many of my colleagues know from personal experience that being a parent is tough work--even for Senators. 
I come to the floor today to speak as an advocate for more family time. My family is my lifeblood. They were by my side long before I became a Senator, and they will be by my side long after I leave this job. If I had to make a choice between politics and parenting, my duties as a father would receive my vote. 
Having said that, I think it is important that my 
colleagues keep in mind that there are millions of working American parents in their States who confront far greater difficulties managing work and families than we do. As a Senator, I have flexibility to spend time with my family. But what about the millions of working parents that want paid time off with their kids? They can't have it because they remain tethered to a 60-year-old act that prevents them from crossing that bridge to the 21st century. 
This is a different world from 60 years ago. In 1938, only 2 out of 12 mothers worked. Now, 9 out of 12 mothers work. We have had so much Government help that two parents in a family have to work. One works to pay the bills; the other one works to pay the taxes. We have to reverse that trend. Until we do, we have to find ways that they can keep the family together and have time to spend with their families.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, today there will be a period for morning business to allow a number of Senators to speak until 11 a.m. It is hoped that following morning business, the Senate will be able to begin consideration of the IDEA legislation. As the majority leader previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. Any votes ordered with respect to the IDEA bill will be stacked to occur at a later date. As always, all Senators will be notified when any votes are ordered. It is also possible that the Senate could consider the CFE Treaty during today's session. Again, any votes ordered with respect to that treaty will be postponed to occur at a later date. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation in both these matters. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the Senator from Georgia for this important piece of legislation. I rise to join my colleagues and friends in supporting the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. This bill aims to protect one of the bulwarks of our democratic Government, and that is America's volunteers. That is the foundation of the United States. That is a principle that we have been working on for a long time. We seem to be losing a little of the momentum that our forefathers had in the area of voluntarism, and part of that has to come out of fear. 
Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to preside over the Senate for several hours. During that time, I was amazed at the direction of this particular debate. While my Republican colleagues have been working to achieve meaningful legal protection for volunteers, one Democrat after another has paraded on to the Senate floor to discuss matters absolutely unrelated to protecting volunteers from frivolous litigation. I have heard speeches on the budget, on flood relief, on Medicare and on Alexis Herman, just to name a few. But I have not heard any meaningful discussion by my colleagues across the aisle on protecting America's volunteers. 
It is time that we get serious about helping our Nation's volunteers, and this is not going to happen by wandering into these other various and sundry tangents. 
I heard the debate on the budget. The budget is not this debate. The budget is still being negotiated, and I understand that is going well, but it is not possible for us to debate the budget on the floor right now. It is not being held up by this 
piece of legislation, which should only take a little while to debate and pass. 
I heard them talk about the supplemental budget, and a portion of that, of course, is emergency relief, and it is important. It is important in my State as well as for the people who have debated this. But that is not before this body either. That is in committee, and the issues that have been raised on that are not ones that are being affected by this debate. 
I have heard discussions on Medicare and Alexis Herman. Alexis Herman may be more at the center of this delay than anything else that has been brought up. 
Right now, there is a hearing taking place on a bill that will solve the Executive order. Hopefully, that bill will get a quick hearing--it appears to be--and it will be brought over here and will undo any misconceptions that there might be on the Alexis Herman situation, which appears to be a basis of a major Presidential change since the hearings were held in committee. 
Those hearings were held, but the President has changed the momentum of his policy with labor since the time of those hearings, but that is not a part of this debate either. We have not had any debate from the other side of the aisle about protecting our volunteers. Instead, we have had a filibuster on a motion to proceed. This is not even the bill itself, this is just the motion to proceed. I assume we will have another filibuster when we get to the bill itself. 
This is a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. We are a volunteer country, or we used to be. We are becoming a country of mercenaries. We are beginning to pay people to volunteer. Can they truly be called a volunteer if they are paid to do that? And if we begin to pay and pay constantly, will we ever have true volunteers? 
We talk about the momentum of volunteers, and that has been a long and proud tradition in the United States. Volunteer organizations represent a distinctly American manner of living, living out the golden rule by strengthening our neighborhoods, our schools, and our churches. 
When I was mayor of Gillette, we had tremendous growth, more than doubled in size, and we needed everything basic that a community could possibly have. That included mostly water and sewer and streets. We did not have money for parks that the people moving there wanted. We got an intern from the University of Wyoming to sit down with any group that wanted a park, and he would design a park for them. The catch was they had to build it, and they did. We built seven parks in one summer with volunteers. These were young people who were moving into a boom community. If they had known about liability, I do not know that they would have participated. 
I spent 10 years as a soccer coach. I am not sure today I would be a soccer coach. I don't think I could take the liability. I have worked with Boy Scouts. It has become such a litigious society that the Boy Scouts now have requirements that any time there is a boy working on a project, there have to be two adults around, and that is to prevent lawsuits. The Boy Scouts used to have annual Christmas tree sales in Gillette. When I went to serve with my son selling Christmas trees, I had to have another adult along, because of our litigious society. That definitely discourages volunteers. 
Volunteer organizations have strengthened and nourished the lives of our citizens and influenced every facet of our culture. 
A brief reflection on the myriad of volunteers and volunteer organizations that serve our fellow citizens should remind us of their tremendous value. The volunteers of the Salvation Army help feed and clothe the less fortunate and provide Christmas gifts for thousands of children every year. Meals on Wheels has for years provided more meals and conversation to many of our Nation's homebound. Habitat for Humanity has helped revitalize our inner cities by providing privately owned houses for the Nation's poor. Mother Theresa's Missionaries of Charity cares for thousands of dying AIDS patients and unwed mothers in the poorest neighborhoods across the country. 
I could go on and on with the Jaycees, Lions Clubs, the Kiwanis, the Rotary and the Optimists. The Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts help instill in children the virtues of responsibility and enterprise, while Little League and youth soccer leagues teach children the values of team cooperation and hard work. 
Volunteers in these organizations, and countless others, have given generously of themselves in order to help their neighbors and better their communities. Unfortunately, even these volunteers have fallen prey to our suit-happy legal system. Lawsuits, in recent years, have resulted in enormous verdicts against volunteers and nonprofit organizations. Too often these suits are for what most of us would consider frivolous claims that penalize volunteers who are simply doing their jobs. 
The threat of costly litigation and large verdicts have frightened many good citizens away from giving their time and energy to volunteer organizations. It is time to curb that trend. The Volunteer Protection Act would relieve a volunteer from liability if the volunteer is acting within the scope and responsibility and if the volunteer is properly licensed, certified and authorized by the State in which the harm occurred, if such authorization is required. 
It also limits punitive damages that may be awarded against volunteers and nonprofit organizations for the actions of the volunteers. This bill does not protect volunteers from liability for actions which are willful or criminal or which involve gross negligence. As such, this bill strikes a healthy balance. It provides broad protection for volunteers who are performing their duties, while still allowing people to recover against volunteers who cause harm from acts that are willful, criminal or grossly negligent. 
Mr. President, it is time to restore some sanity to our tort system. Let's begin by protecting our Nation's volunteers from the slings and arrows of outrageous litigation. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Volunteer Act. 
As we were growing up, we were taught to do what is right, to do our best, to treat others as we wanted to be treated, to take the common courtesy of asking others what they need to have done, and in America, we not only ask what they need to have done, but people follow up on that, not to the degree that we could, not to the degree that we used to. 
My mother always taught me that service is the price that you pay for the space that you take up on this Earth. The service concept in this Nation is a foundation that we have to continue to promote, and our system of litigation has taken that away from us. 
Let us restore service and voluntarism in this country and give some protection. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. On behalf of the majority leader, I will announce the schedule for today's session. 
This morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 11:30 a.m. to accommodate a number of Senators who have requested time to speak. By a previous consent agreement, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate will begin consideration of S. 562, the reverse mortgage bill. It is the understanding of the leadership that no Senator will request a rollcall vote on passage. Therefore, Senators should not expect a rollcall vote to occur during today's session of the Senate. 
Following disposition of S. 562, it is the intention of the majority leader to ask the Senate to begin consideration of S. 543, the volunteer protection bill. If there is an objection to proceeding to that bill, it may be necessary for the majority leader to move to proceed to S. 543 and file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed. That cloture vote would occur on Tuesday of next week, and therefore there would be no rollcall votes during Monday's session of the Senate. Consequently, Senators can expect the next rollcall vote to occur on Tuesday, April 29, at 2:15 p.m. As always, Senators will be notified as soon as any agreement is reached and the rollcall vote is scheduled. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the charges made consistently during the weeks of debate over this treaty is the charge that supporters of this treaty desired to see chemical weapons abolished from the earth, while opponents have no such interest. Nothing could be further from the truth. Opponents of the treaty also desire to see these heinous weapons abolished. We have simply contended that a poorly drafted treaty will not only fail to achieve that worthy end, but could even lead to their increased proliferation. 
I am pleased to report that, as of this morning, opponents of the original treaty draft have prevailed in our efforts to add teeth and additional safeguards to what was heretofore an unacceptable document. To begin with, the Senate yesterday voted to add twenty-eight additional provisions to the CWC. These provisions tighten our intelligence sharing procedures to keep classified information out of the wrong hands, would maintain the stricter exporting restrictions as outlined in the `Australia Group' protocol, would enhance monitoring and verification of compliance, and would greatly beef up our military's chemical warfare defense capabilities. In addition, the Senate leadership this morning received a letter from the President committing him to withdrawing from the convention if it leads to the degradation of our chemical weapons defenses, or leads to chemical weapons proliferation. 
I believe this treaty is now worthy of ratification and will vote accordingly. Rest assured, however, that a treaty is only as reliable as the offices administering it. Consequently I have every intention of continuously evaluating the performance of the administration and the United Nations relative to their implementation of these treaty provisions. Should any party come up short in their verification and enforcement duties, we will be right there to set them straight.

Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate and am impressed with the thoroughness with which the two Senators from Missouri have covered this particular issue, but I do have a few additional comments I would like to add. 
I do rise in support of the Assisted Suicide Restriction Act of 1997, H.R. 1003. I am reminded of the story that I heard when I was very young, and it had an impression which has carried over the years. 
It is a story of a kid out playing, and he saw his father carrying this large basket. He went over and asked his dad what it was all about. 
He said, `Well, you know, your grandfather had not been very well, not doing well at all, not able to contribute anymore. We sensed he really did not enjoy life anymore. So he is in the basket, and I am taking him down to the river.' 
The little boy was not impacted much from that. The kid said, `What are you going to do with the basket when you are done?" 
He said, `Why are you so concerned about the basket?" 
He said, `Because some day I am going to need it for you.' 
It is important that we as a Congress reaffirm our commitment to the sanctity of human life in all its stages. This is one of the primary duties of the U.S. Senate and as members of a civilized society. The sanctity of human life was clearly articulated in our Nation's charter. The Declaration of Independence counts the right to life as one of the self-evident and unalienable rights with which we have all been endowed by our Creator. 
By safeguarding the right to life, our Government fulfills its most fundamental duty to the American people. By violating that right to life, we violate our sacred trust with our Nation's citizens and the families of our country and the legacy that we will leave to those not yet born. 
The legislation now before us takes an important step in restoring our Nation's commitment to the importance of the lives of all Americans, especially those who suffer from serious illnesses. This bill would prohibit the direct or indirect use of any Federal funds for the purpose of causing the death of a human being by assisted suicide. It would assure the American people that their hard-earned tax dollars would not be used to fund a principle that they do not believe in--suicide. It would also help Federal dollars to be provided in the form of grants to public and private organizations to help people with chronic or serious illnesses who may be considering suicide. 
This legislation would not affect individual States' living will statutes regarding the withholding or withdrawing of medical treatment or medical care. It simply prohibits the Federal Government from directly, or indirectly, funding assisted suicides. We, as a society, must demonstrate our respect for the life of all Americans, especially those who are sick and needy. 
Mr. President, when I ran for office, I campaigned on the pledge that I would fight for all life. I was elected on that pledge and sent to Washington where I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. Physicians also take on the rigors of a campaign to become doctors. Although they are not voted into office, they work just as hard to fulfill their commitments and receive their degrees. Upon graduation, all physicians are intimately familiar with the Hippocratic Oath and its basic premise: First, do no harm. If I might quote from that oath specifically, it says: 
I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgment, but I will never use it to injure or wrong them. I will not give poison to anyone though asked to do so, nor will I suggest such a plan. 
Those powerful words reflect a great insight and wisdom into the human condition. Though they were written so many years ago, they still resonate today. I share them with my colleagues as I 
urge their support for this legislation. It is our future, too. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, thank you. 
I rise today to address an issue that is of great concern to the people of the State of Wyoming as well as the citizens of America. 
During my campaign last summer and fall, and again since I have taken office, I have traveled all across the great State of Wyoming. I have traveled from Cheyenne in the south to Sheridan in the north and from Evanston in the west to Sundance in the east and all of the counties in between. One message came through loud and clear from the citizens of Wyoming: Our tax system is too complicated and our taxes are too high. 
Working families are forced to pay too much for their income to a bloated Federal Government. 
Small businesses, which are the backbone of the American economy, are strangled by a complicated and often punitive Tax Code. As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I have had to weed through a Tax Code which is frustratingly complex. And as a small businessman, I have experienced firsthand the Tax Code which all too often discourages individual enterprise and penalizes ingenuity. As a husband and a father, I have felt the burden of working for nearly half a year to pay all the taxes levied by the Federal, State, and local governments. I promised the people of Wyoming that I would work to make the tax system simpler and fairer so that the taxpayers of Wyoming and America could keep more of their hard-earned money. 
I should note that it has been the Republicans who have long been sounding the battle cry for lower taxes and smaller Federal Government. It was the Republicans who led the charge on the balanced budget constitutional amendment. And it is the Republicans who have shown the determination to provide meaningful tax relief for America's families. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I am also proud to be a cosponsor of several bills that would get us closer to a simpler and fairer tax system. 
With tax day now upon us, we are reminded of the impact our current tax system has on all of us. We are paying the price for a Government that has too long lived beyond its means. Like a child in a candy shop, the Federal Government hasn't met a sugar-coated spending project it did not like. To pay for its appetite, Congress has left the American people holding the tab with higher and higher taxes. It's time for Congress to rein in the Federal Government and ease the burden it places on America's taxpayers. 
Since I was sworn in as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I have joined my Republican colleagues in cosponsoring legislation that would allow America's families to keep more of what they earn. The American Family Tax Relief Act includes a $500-per-child tax credit, substantial cuts in the capital gains rate, and sizable reductions in the punitive estate tax. This legislation helps families with children by returning some of their hard-earned money to them. The American Family Tax Relief Act encourages investment and frees up creative capital by lessening the penalty of the capital gains transactions. 
I have cosponsored legislation that would help small businesses by allowing them a 100-percent deduction on health insurance coverage for their employees. This home-based business tax relief would put small businesses on a similar footing with the larger competitors who currently enjoy full deductibility of their employee's health care costs. It would also broaden the home office deduction so that parents and other individuals who choose to operate businesses out of their homes can receive more benefit from their expenses. This legislation encourages economic growth and creativity and lessens the tax burden on America's families. It would also take us another step closer to a Tax Code which sparks ingenuity and encourages family-owned business. 
There remains little doubt in the minds of the American people that the Tax Code is in need of serious surgery. The present Tax Code is needlessly complicated and treats American businesses and individuals unfairly. One example of this is the alternative minimum tax. This tax system, first instituted in 1986, has imposed substantial hardships on capital-intensive businesses, like mining and manufacturing, in Wyoming and across America. These businesses are forced to compute their taxes under both the regular corporate method and the alternative minimum tax method. This affects the farms and ranches as well. And they have to pay the greater of the two amounts. This compliance is expensive for businesses, and it ties up valuable capital that could be used to expand their operations and provide new jobs. 
The alternative minimum tax is a punitive tax because it effectively penalizes businesses that invest in equipment and structures necessary for the operation of their businesses. The current alternative minimum tax system is yet another example of why it is time to inject some common sense into the Internal Revenue Code. 
Reform of the alternative minimum tax would simplify the Tax Code and make the accounting method more consistent with the regular corporate tax rules. This legislation would make the Tax Code fairer for thousands of businesses that are now at a serious tax disadvantage. It marks an important step toward restoring simplicity and integrity to America's tax system. 
Reforming the alternative minimum tax depreciation allowance would work wonders for the American economy. One recent study estimates that the investment resulting from AMT reform would increase America's gross domestic product by $15 billion over an 8-year period. This would spur a surge in employment. Total jobs would roughly increase by 100,000 per year during a 5-year period. These jobs would be largely concentrated in the high-paying manufacturing sector of the economy. That is why this reform is needed so badly. The new high-paying jobs that would be available in my home State of Wyoming and throughout America will do wonders to improve our 
economy and the strength of our families. It is high time we give the American people the commonsense tax relief they so strongly desire. 
Right now, we tax anything that moves, we tax what doesn't move, we tax it when you buy it, we tax it when you sell it, we tax you for living. One of the worst taxes of all is that we tax you for dying. We want you to be able to keep more of your own money to do what you know how to do best. As tax day quickly approaches, I urge my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in giving the American people meaningful tax reform. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President. Today, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Thomas from Wyoming, Senator McConnell from Kentucky, and Senator Bennett from Utah, in urging the Justice Department to exercise its enforcement powers to break the current anticompetitive lock on college football, if football does not do it itself. 
I have a special interest in college athletics. I followed college athletics for some years, and I enjoy the excitement and competition of college basketball and football. I especially enjoy the competition in the Western Athletic Conference. My son, Brad, played basketball at the University of Wyoming, and so I watched numerous WAC games, both as a Cowboy fan and as a father. I am disappointed to see the University of Wyoming and other very competitive WAC teams kept out of the top college bowl games because of the anticompetitive College Bowl Alliance. These clandestine agreements keep our players on the bench and in the grandstand when they should be out there on the field. 
I think it is interesting we are discussing the anticompetitive effects of the college football alliance in the midst of the NCAA college basketball tournament. The NCAA basketball playoff system, while not perfect, aims to include the finest 64 college basketball teams in the Nation. In this tournament, any of those 64 teams has the possibility of winning the national championship. This arrangement is designed to maximize competition for the benefit of all the players, the fans, and the schools involved. In contrast, the College Bowl Alliance 
has decreased the competitiveness of college football to the detriment of the fans and schools involved. 
The alliance is a coalition of top football college conferences and representatives of the top post-season college football bowls. Over the past few years, the alliance has entered into a number of restrictive agreements designed to divide the market of the most highly lucrative New Year's football bowls. These agreements effectively preclude the nonalliance teams from having access to the most prestigious and lucrative bowl games, even when one of the nonalliance teams has a better record and a higher national ranking than any of the alliance teams. These restrictive agreements are bad for football, and they violate Federal antitrust law. 
Just this last January, as you have heard, 2 of the top 25 ranked football teams in the country fell victim to this anticompetitive alliance. Brigham Young University, a member of the nonalliance Western Athletic Conference, finished the year with a remarkable record of 13 and 1 and was ranked 5th in the Nation. Another member of the WAC, the University of Wyoming, finished its regular season with a formidable 10 and 2 record and a national ranking of 22, but it was not given an offer to play in any of the alliance bowls. In fact, as has been mentioned, despite its excellent year, the University of Wyoming was not given the opportunity to play in any post-season bowl game. This came as a great disappointment to the Cowboy fans nationwide. 
The alliance is bad for football since, as a practical matter, it prohibits teams from outside the alliance playing the top bowl games. The football games are now taking a back seat to the money games being played behind doors closed to both players and the fans. This has resulted in alliance teams having an institutional advantage in both bowl receipts and future recruiting. 
In 1996, the eight alliance bowl participants, including the teams playing in the Rose Bowl, split a total of $68 million. That was eight teams. In contrast, the 28 nonalliance participants divided a total of $31 million. This disparity in financial return is not good business. It results in a built-in advantage for alliance teams in the areas of future recruiting and program development. 
The alliance agreement provides unlawful economic protection for its members to the detriment of college football generally. The alliance's market allocation agreements have, in turn, hurt consumers. One poll has shown that college football fans would have preferred to have seen several nonalliance teams, including Brigham Young University and the University of Colorado, in top bowl games. These agreements amounted to changing the rules with 2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. These are precisely the type of market allocation agreements the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed to prohibit. 
I strongly urge the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to use their statutory powers to end the alliance's anticompetitive stranglehold on college football if they cannot do it on their own. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of The Home-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997, introduced today by the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator Bond. I know that Senator Bond, Senator Nickles and Senator Snowe have worked hard to draft this bill and I am proud to be an original cosponsor. It addresses three concerns that have weighed heavily on the small business community for years: First health insurance fairness; second the home-office deduction; and third the status of independent contractors. I hope the Senate and the House will move quickly to pass this legislation. 
It is a good bill because it responds directly to what small businesses have been asking us to do. It will help create jobs that will put people on welfare back to work. This is an issue that policymakers have been concentrating on since last year's welfare debate--the President has proposed a Welfare to Work Program while Congress is looking at the best ways to stimulate the economy and create jobs. Toward that effort, it is impossible to overlook the importance of small business. Small businesses create nearly 100 percent of this country's new jobs and employ over 65 percent of Americans working in the private sector. And I guarantee it would be small businesses that hire the majority of today's welfare recipients if Government would make it affordable to do so. 
Small business is more than the backbone of this country. Small business is the engine of the American Dream. But it needs a system that empowers people, not government. This bill would help people by removing just a couple of the obstacles in the way of that Dream. 
When I was elected to the Senate last November, my first choice of committee assignments was the Small Business Committee. My wife, Diana, and I were small businessowners and we have experienced--at one time or another--nearly all of the obstacles that can stand in the way of a successful small business. At this time last year, in fact, my wife and I were balancing our books and paying our taxes--hoping to find that the books still balanced after paying the taxes! So I know what small businessowners are going through. Very recently, I have been there. 
There is a lot of talk in this legislative body about improving the environment for small business. In fact, I doubt that any Member would stand up and say he or she does not support small business. We hold hearings and listen to testimony, we provide for White House conferences on small business, we receive stacks of polling data and we create commission after commission to tell us what needs to be done. In the end, we find out what I think we already know--the problem is taxes. Too many and too much. 
This bill is a small step in the Tax Code, but a giant step for sensibility. It recognizes some of the revolutionary changes in American business. The advent of personal computers, high speed modems, cell phones, pagers, and fax machines that have enabled Americans to work via audio and video conferencing, from satellite 
offices, and by telecommuting. Our tax laws have not kept up with the sea of change in American business. 
One example of this change is the increasing number of women in our Nation's work force. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children now work. Among two-parent households, 63 percent report that both parents must work outside the home--in many cases, one works to pay the bills, while the other works to pay the taxes. And of these women entering the work force, 1 in 20 are starting their own businesses and many are home based and that number is rising rapidly. In fact, women start new businesses at twice the rate of men--and with a very good success rate. But the Tax Code needs improvement. It discourages self-employment and home-based business through discrimination and complexity. This bill would change that. 
The Home-Based Business Fairness Act would finally put an end to our regressive, two-tiered system that makes self-employed people pay more for their health insurance. It is time to give small business competitive parity with big business. All the technical assistance and loan guarantees in the world cannot overcome unfair tax treatment and disproportionately burdensome regulations. Last year, Congress recognized the inequality by voting to phase in an 80-percent deductibility for health insurance costs. That's a good start. But if we know the tax treatment is not fair, then shouldn't we make it right? America's small businesses need fair and equal treatment. 
This legislation would also add fairness for people who work in their homes. Our current outdated Tax Code discriminates against home-based people by restricting their ability to deduct office expenses. The message is, if you can't afford a real office, then you can't deduct your expenses. In this way, we increase the hurdles for entrepreneurs who want to earn a living, but can't afford to rent separate office space. This part of the legislation will benefit thousands of home-based women and men. It is very important and deserves a thoughtful consideration by the Senate. 
Another puzzling antibusiness setup that this bill would simplify is the definition of independent contractor. American entrepreneurs--and especially home-based business owners--need a simpler test. I have always believed we could make things a lot easier if we just followed the payroll taxes. Who pays them? Is there a written contract? It does not have to be `rocket science.' This legislation would simplify the test so that everyone can understand it--not just the tax attorneys at the Internal Revenue Service. 
On that subject, in Wyoming recently, the IRS has taken after the last bastion of budding entrepreneurs, our paper boys. Once again, the thirsty IRS auditors are devising ways to haunt working people--presumed guilty until proven innocent. When did the IRS decide to pick on the hard-earned wages of independent paperboys and girls? They are not now, and never have been, salaried newspaper employees. They are just kids who want to earn some money by working before or after school. 
I think we should call this part of the bill, The Paperboy Protection Act. The last bastion for new entrepreneurs needs our help. The small business owners of tomorrow are counting on us to pass this legislation. I thank my colleagues on the Small Business Committee, and the assistant majority leader, for their hard work on the bill. I urge other Senators to support it.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair. 
I am pleased to be here today and have an opportunity to address Senate Joint Resolution 18, the proposed constitutional amendment to limit campaign contributions and expenditures. I am a freshman Senator. I came through an election last fall and have a number of things I would like to see addressed on campaign reform, but I have to say that I do not think a constitutional amendment is the right forum for beginning that debate. 
This attempt to exclude core political speech from the first amendment's protection is a terrible assault on one of the very cornerstones of American representative democracy, the freedom of private citizens to participate in the public forum of political discourse through freedom of speech. 
This constitutional amendment is dangerous both in its design and its broad and sweeping scope. This expansive amendment would grant Congress the future power to prohibit independent citizens from distributing leaflets, writing editorials, producing independent commercials, and/or handing out voter guides if Congress finds these measures to be `in support of or in opposition to a candidate for Federal office.' This is precisely the kind of Government intrusion our Founders feared when they drafted and adopted the first amendment to the Constitution. The first amendment was designed to protect citizens against the dangers of a tyrannical Federal Government. It was adopted because our Founders rightly realized that there are some freedoms that are so intrinsic to the nature of a representative democracy that they must be protected from the momentary wishes of a majority in the Federal Congress. 
When asked what use the Bill of Rights served in our popular Government, James Madison explained, `The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion.' In other words, it was to protect 
against such impulses as those now suggested by many of the would-be reformers that the founders drafted the first amendment's protection of speech in broad and unequivocal terms. `Congress shall pass no law abridging the freedom of speech.' 
A brief analysis of the effects of this amendment should terrify even the most ardent reformers. A few examples should show the chilling effect this amendment could have on political freedom of speech. This amendment gives Congress the power to set limits on the amount of expenditures that may be made in support of or in opposition to a candidate for Federal office. 
I will start with the worst example first. Suppose that one party again gains control of both Houses of Congress and the Presidency. In order to maintain its monopoly on Government, this Congress could pass a law limiting the expenditures of congressional challengers to $5,000. What sort of possibility would this give any challenger. Such a proposal would all but guarantee a perpetual Congress of incumbents. As outlandish as such a proposal sounds on its face, it would be legal under this amendment. 
Again, even the freedom of the press could fall under the vast scope of this amendment. Let us consider a proposal which would prohibit any editorial against a candidate or a group of candidates. Such a law could well be passed under this amendment if Congress decides that such editorials are expenditures by the newspaper `in opposition to' a candidate for Federal office. Congress could have the power to limit or even prohibit press reports for or against a particular candidate since expenditures must be made to print and distribute a newspaper or broadcast a television or radio news report. 
Finally, let us consider the case where a private citizen wishes to write an editorial or hand out leaflets in favor of a particular candidate or his or her positions. Again, this amendment would give Congress the power to prohibit such activities. Expenditures must be made to write and publish editorials or hand out handbills. Congress could pass a law outlawing such expenditures in support of candidates if it so desired. This amendment would have a drastic and dangerous impact on the free discussion of ideas in this country. 
Newspapers also might not come under the law but we might come under an expenditure law, so they could write things about the candidate to which they may now not be able to respond in light of not having sufficient funds within the limited amounts. 
Proponents of this constitutional amendment have accepted as their first premise in the campaign reform debate that the first amendment to our Constitution is incompatible with a healthy electoral process. One of the original House sponsors of this gutting of the first amendment proclaimed unabashedly: `What we have is two important values in direct conflict: freedom of speech and our desire for healthy campaigns in a healthy Democracy. You can't have both.' 
This remarkable confession by one of the leading reformers is as startling for its boldness as it is for its inaccuracy. We should beware of any campaign reform which can only be achieved by destroying the first amendment. This false conflict between free speech and democracy was rejected by our Founding Fathers, and it should be rejected by the Members of this Senate. Our Founding Fathers rightly understood that it is precisely the unhindered protection of freedom and open political speech that makes democracy possible. 
I find it fascinating that in the 2 months I have been honored to serve in this deliberative body we have debated now two proposed constitutional amendments. These two amendments could not be more opposed in their purpose or their effect. The balanced budget constitutional amendment, of which I was a proud cosponsor, would have placed constitutional limits on Congress' power to squander away our children's economic future. Senate Joint Resolution 18 would give Congress expansive and unprecedented new powers of prohibiting core political speech. The balanced budget amendment would have limited the Congress' power by restricting its ability to spend money it does not have. Senate Joint Resolution 18 would constitutionally expand Congress' power to regulate the speech of candidates, businesses, private citizens, and perhaps the press and media. 
I support the balanced budget constitutional amendment because I believe that by forcing Congress to live within its means, we give our States, our communities and, most important, our families more freedom to make the decisions which most affect their lives and their futures. I have to oppose this constitutional amendment because it would grant Federal and State governments the power to stifle one of the most basic political freedoms: the freedom of individual citizens to express themselves freely and without restraint in the public forum. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in affirming the time-honored wisdom of the first amendment of the Constitution by rejecting Senate Joint Resolution 18. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, want to urge all my colleagues to vote for the balanced budget constitutional amendment. As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I have been interested in the various accounting issues that have been brought up as part of this discussion. I am very disappointed that while accounting techniques are needed to know exactly where we stand and what to do, there have been a lot of sham techniques that have been brought up so that some of the people would have a hook on which to add a no vote--and that is all that they are. 
We need to have good accounting. We need to protect Social Security. There is no one in this body who does not want us to take care of Social Security. The way to do that is through a balanced budget constitutional amendment. We owe it to our kids and to our grandkids. We owe it to our parents and our grandparents. We have to make sure that we have a balanced budget to keep this country going forward, 
with or without that amendment. I have heard promises here, but I am not so sure about promises anymore that we would balance the budget, and it is critical that we balance the budget. I will be counting on everyone to help on that. I ask for support of the balanced budget constitutional amendment.

Mr. ENZI. When we woke up this morning, I wonder how many of us paused to reflect on the great gift we have been given--the gift of our freedom. It is a special gift, but so many of us take it for granted, even though we paid for it at quite a heavy price. As we drove to work, how many of us thought about the sacrifices that were made over the years by our Nation's veterans to preserve and protect those freedoms? 
Six years ago, President Bush was in the White House and he had a difficult task on his hands. 
The world was in crisis. The United Nations was meeting night and day to try to stop the spread of the threat of Saddam Hussein. He had invaded Kuwait and brought the people of that nation to their knees. Something had to be done. 
When the cry for help went out from Kuwait, we sent our best to answer the call. Many brave men and women went to a foreign land to stop the advance of that madman in the deserts of Kuwait and Iraq. 
In the days that followed, we picked up a whole new vocabulary. We spoke of Scuds, Patriot missiles, chemical weapons, gas masks, Riyadh, and so much more. 
It was a war we witnessed like no other battle in our history. We charted our troops' progress with the reports we saw on the news every night. We were a part of it all. The press took us right along with our soldiers as the fighting progressed. Everything came to us live as the media brought the conflict right into our living rooms. 
It was almost like watching a movie. It seemed so distant and dangerous. Yet, somehow, because of our advanced technology, we thought our young men and women would be safe and that they would all make it home. Would that it were so. 
When it was over, and the battle had been won, we all felt a great wave of relief that our casualties had been light. But light casualties, don't feel so light when they include our families, our friends, and our loved ones. 
One hundred and forty-six young people did not come back. I say this in their memory as I mention one young man who didn't come home from that battle came from Gillette, WY. Manuel Davila was a young father, a nice guy who always had a smile and a kind word for everyone he met. He was the kind of person you'd like to have for a friend. That is why he had so many friends. 
I watched Manuel grow up. He was a remarkable young man. He came from the town I call home. You didn't get to meet him, so I should use the words of Ron Franscell, the editor of the Gillette News Record, who wrote so eloquently 6 years ago as Manuel's body was brought home for burial: `I never knew Manuel, but he was from my town, he was one of us, and he had dreams. In that way, I knew him very well. You know him, too.' 
Yes, Ron, we all did know him, too. 
Manuel saw a need, and when he was asked to go, he didn't hesitate. He was doing his job and it was a job he loved and felt proud to have been called to do. That's what it was to him. He felt good to be a part of this special mission for he understood how much it meant to the defenseless people of Kuwait who needed him so very badly. 
In Wyoming, we like to think of our State as holy ground that was blessed by God. It is a land of open spaces, beautiful mountains that seem to stretch up to God's heaven, green forests, national parks, clean, clear, cool air and wide open spaces. 
Manuel traded all of that for a far different world. 
He traded his clear blue skies for a desert sky that was pitch black with the fumes and smoke of oil fields set on fire by Iraqi troops. He traded his beautiful mountain paradise for an isolated desert wasteland. He traded the clean, crisp air of Wyoming for the use of a gas mask and the threat of Saddam's chemical weapons. He traded the safety and security of his homeland for the uncertainty and danger of a battlefield. He traded it all to go overseas and fight for freedom. 
When it was all over, in spite of all the precautions we had taken to protect our troops, this brave young man didn't make it home. A wife had lost her husband, and a family had lost a son. A little girl had lost her father. 
Six years ago we brought him back home to Wyoming. The loss of Manuel in the desert reinforced the truth of an adage made famous by an old television show written about a different war. In one scene a doctor says that there are two rules of war. The first rule is that young men and women die. The second rule is there is nothing that can be done to change rule 1. It is the awful truth of battle. 
Today, although we are far removed from that battlefield, we must never forget the sacrifices that were made by Manuel and by so many more who gave their lives for great causes like the one that claimed young Manuel's life. We must continue to honor their memory and commemorate their brave and courageous actions that were done in our name. Truly, far too many have made the ultimate sacrifice that we might be free. 
There is no greater way we can honor Manuel's memory and that of our other great war heroes than to rededicate ourselves every day of our lives to the cause of peace. I find great inspiration for that cause and the importance of peace when I reflect on the beautiful words of the Book of Isaiah in the Bible: `They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.' 
Yes, Manuel was one of our great heroes of Wyoming and of these United States. He was a good kid, a hometown boy who had plans for his future. That future was cruelly taken from him on foreign soil by a madman. Now, the torch Manuel carried so bravely in battle is passed to us to light the path to peace in our lives. We had best carry it high and proudly as we commit our every effort to ensuring that we will never again ask our young men and women to make the ultimate sacrifice, as we work together to avoid the horrors of war. If we are successful, we will truly live in a world of peace, where nation shall not lift up sword against nation. That is the best way for us to care for those who have borne the battle, by ensuring that it never happens again.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have a question on some of the things the Senator has been talking about on capital budgeting.

It does not define what major capital improvements are.

Mr. ENZI. In the President's budget I notice that he listed social investment as a capital expenditure. That is why I was asking the question about education. I am concerned that the capital budget procedure is just an attempt to be able to move everything outside of the normal budgeting procedure so, in fact, we do not have to balance the budget. That is why I want more definition on what is meant by `capital budget.'

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate all the words that have been said here this morning, particularly those that call for us to do a bipartisan consensus. 
I am a big believer in the U.S. Constitution. I carry my own copy of the U.S. Constitution. In article V it tells us how to amend this Constitution, and it says that it is going to have to be a bipartisan effort if it is going to take two-thirds when the majority party has 55. This is going to be a bipartisan effort, but it has to be an effort that winds up with a constitutional amendment that will do what the American public is demanding. They are demanding that we come up with a balanced budget. 
I get to stand next to these unbalanced budgets, the last 28 years of work in this body, and I know that, individually, the people in this body have said we have to balance the budget. And I am willing to do it. It is collectively that we have had a little trouble getting it done. It is in that bipartisan manner that we have had trouble getting it done. It is in that situation when we are having to tell the people back home `no' for any particular issue. Somebody told me it takes political will to balance a budget. I really contend it takes political `won't' to balance a budget. 
We are talking today about an amendment that will deal with capital budgeting. As the only accountant in the Senate, I am fascinated by some of the definitions of capital budgeting that I am hearing here and reading about in the paper, that the President has said. It looks to me like the Federal idea of capital budgeting is not only a risky gimmick, it is also a loophole so big that you could drive an interstate through it, or an aircraft carrier, or planes and buses, or buildings. Anything can be driven through the loophole that will be created by this nice term `capital budgeting.' 
I, too, have run into the people at home who say, `Wait a minute, I have a mortgage on my house. How is that different from the United States?' And I say, `Are you paying off the mortgage, or are you just paying the interest? And can you buy two or three or five houses and only pay the interest?' That is what we are trying to do with capital budgeting with the Federal Government. We are saying we don't have to pay the principal back; interest is the only thing that is important. 
You and I know if you borrow enough, pretty quick the interest equals all of your revenue. We are a little ways away from that yet in the United States, but it is a distinct possibility. We are talking about a possibility of telling our kids or our grandkids, `You have to pay 84 percent of your wages in taxes and you will get nothing for it because you are going to be paying the interest on the houses that we bought and used up.' 
At that point, we are going to have a revolution in this country. It is not going to be the same kind of gentle change we are used to. It is not going to be subject to the same slow processes. We are going to have a generation that is going to say, `I am paying Social Security to people I don't even know, and I am never going to get any.' And they are going to take Social Security away. If we do not begin balancing budgets, there will not be Social Security. 
I don't think there is a single person in this entire body who does not want to protect Social Security. But how long are we going to wait before we protect Social Security? 
We keep talking about capital budgeting. I have said any kind of budgeting would be really great. What we are really talking about is cash-flow budgeting, I think, rather than capital budgeting, unless we are talking about that tremendous loophole, the one that says we can designate anything we want as capital and we can shift it off budget--I hate those words; it is not a good accounting term--but we no longer have to be responsible for anything that we can call capital budgeting, which is a very good accounting term. 
The President's commission on setting up a capital budget will not be nearly as restrictive as was the question that I asked earlier. That commission will report on including physical capital and intangible or human capital. That is the social capital I was talking about, the social investment I was talking about before. This loophole would virtually allow anything to be deemed as a capital investment. 
I would like to go into a little bit of what happens in some of the other entities that we do allow the right to do capital budgeting, and really what we are talking about is loans for capital. The Federal Government has such an extensive budget that we have not been forced to do any capital budgeting, nor in the foreseeable future would we have to do capital budgeting. We should do cash-flow budgeting so we can build all these capital items we are talking about in a logical progression and within budget, and pay back some of the debt that we already owe so there is less interest, so we have more money to spend. 
Probably one of the toughest levels of capital budgeting or loans that we allow to be made is at the local level. I used to be the mayor of a boom town out West that more than doubled in size. We had to have sewer treatment. Yes, there was a Federal program for sewer treatment, but our community had already applied for one of those grants and gotten one and built a sewer treatment plant. Then we had all of these people move in and we exceeded the capacity and were fined for exceeding the capacity of this lifetime plant. So we had to build another sewer treatment plant, and we were last on the list for getting another grant in that area. 
We had to build streets. You cannot have houses without streets that let you get to the houses. We had to increase our garbage collection. We also had our own electrical service. The first day I was in office, I got a call from one of the electrical suppliers who wanted to know what I was going to do when my substation blew up. I had to ask him what a substation was. That is a great big transformer for a town. He told me it was operating at 1.2 capacity, and any warm day it would just be eliminated and my town would be out electricity for maybe 2 weeks while we got a portable substation. I pictured myself for quite awhile being tarred and feathered and ridden out of town, as people's deep freezes thawed or they couldn't read at night or iron or any of the things that we really rely on electricity for but never think about it. 
And water, that was really the biggest problem. That has to be one of the most basic things any of us is involved in, is water. We did not have enough water before the boom. We went on water rationing in May and we got off in October, and our water was color-coded. The cold water came out kind of red because there was iron in the water and it took on that color when it mixed with oxygen, and the hot water came out black because we have a lot of coal in the area I am from and the coal would settle out in the hot water tank and then come out when we used hot water. You have to have water. You can do, maybe, without electricity. You cannot do without water. 
It was not an option to do without either of them, so we had to issue bonds. We had to borrow on a long-term basis. Our water project alone was 43 miles and $23 million away. Out here, that is not a microdot in the budget. It does not mean anything out here. But that was $3,000 in debt for every man, woman, and child living in that town at the time. 
They don't just let municipalities print their own money. There is a process that you have to go through that has a lot of review, because you have to prove to the people who might buy the bonds that those bonds will be paid off. 
I want to make a distinction again on that `paid off,' something we don't even consider around here. In all of the discussion that I have heard on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, in all of the discussion that I have heard on balancing the budget, I have not heard anybody say, `Where's the number here that pays down the national debt?' 
That is what we do with bonding. That is what we do with States when they bond. We have an elaborate process to do everything we can to make sure that those bonds will be valid, which means they will be paid off in a reasonable amount of time. 
So what did I have to go through to get that $23 million? One of the things I had to do was go before Standard & Poor's and Moody's in New York and explain how a town of 8,000 people was going to pay off $24 million in debt. I know that is real small stuff compared to cities in California, but for a guy from rural Wyoming, that was a lot of money. 
It also happened to be at the very same time that New York City was going broke, and Standard & Poor's was having daily meetings with the city to see how they were going to pay off the debt that they already had. I didn't mention forgiving the debt. I know there was some talk about that. But what Standard & Poor's and Moody's was interested in was how it was going to be paid off. They didn't care whether it was Federal grants or how. 
So they had a lot of extra special questions for us on how to do that, and as a result of the discussions, there were also criteria that were placed on the bond issues. This is normal stuff that happens with bond issues. There are covenants. That means that you have to dedicate sources of revenue. I have not heard us talk about any really special dedication of revenues to paying off any of this capital budgeting. I will tell you, they come in and they take that revenue before you get to do anything else with it if you default on the bonds. If you even miss a payment, they come in and demand the money, much the same as if you own a home. 
Then they also put a restriction on, they call it coverage, and coverage is an additional amount beyond the normal payment that goes into a special fund to make sure that you will not default on the bonds. In the case of our bonds, it was 1.25 percent. That means we had to pay into another fund 25 percent more than our payment to assure that we would make future payments. Again, that is something we don't talk about with capital budgeting for the United States. We just talk about spending the money and how we can build loopholes to do more spending outside of the normal budgeting process. 
We also had a requirement of a front-end sinking fund. That means before we could even start the project, we had to put money in a fund to show that we could make the first part of the payments. 
And then, and here is a real divergence from what we do back here, we had to have a vote of the people to go into debt--a vote of the people. What would happen with our budgets, these 28 years of no balanced budgets? Would the people let us do that if they had to vote on what we were spending? I know from the State-level discussions on this that that would be an incredible burden and extreme expense, and we can't go to that extent. No, we can't go to that extent, and we were elected to make those kinds of decisions. But we were elected to make them within certain constraints. The people back home tell me that they expect that constraint to be paying things off. They expect us not only to balance the budget, but to get to a situation, to plan for a situation where we pay down the national debt. That is good budgeting; that is good accounting. 
There was a happy side to this story. We did do capital budgeting. We did cash flow budgeting. We built the things that I talked about, and I want to tell you that today, not because of my efforts, but because of the people who followed me, who followed the cash flow budgeting, that those projects are not only in place, but they are paid for. Gillette, WY, is one of the few places in the United States that is debt free. That is how you run a city. That is how you should run a State, and most States do. Most States are required to, because they have a balanced budget constitutional amendment that forces them to live within their means. And that is how the United States ought to work. 
Capital budgeting could be a great idea, but not if the purpose of capital budgeting is to build loopholes so that we can spend whatever we want to by merely designating it as capital budget. 
We also ought to have performance budgets. There are a whole bunch of things that the private sector is doing that would be very adaptable to the Federal Government, and some States have already done them and some States have found them to be very successful. 
How do you balance a budget? You do it by strategic planning. You have every single person in the Government, down to the very smallest agency, talk about what their mission is, who their customer is, what they are trying to achieve, and how they will get it done. You get them to focus on the real problem of what they are trying to achieve and how they can most efficiently do it. Focus saves money. 
In Wyoming, we talked a long time about strategic planning for the State. We have a thing we call management audits. I am not familiar enough to know if we do that here, but we had a special committee that looked at State agencies. And the purpose of that look was to see if State agencies were doing what the State legislature and the Governor said they were supposed to be doing, if they were following the statutes. I am pleased to say, in most instances, they were doing exactly what we had told them. However, it was in pretty broad terms. 
It wasn't good enough to be a mission statement. It wasn't good enough to give them the finite direction they needed to have the best performance possible. So we instituted strategic planning. We forced all of the agencies to come up with a strategic plan, and most of them did. The ones that were most reluctant today are the biggest supporters of strategic planning. Once they tried it, they couldn't believe how it worked. 
The way that it works is the agencies for the budget process, actually the individuals in the agencies actually wind up saying, `These are the things that we shouldn't be doing in our agency.' I can tell you that the general public said, `Wow, I didn't even know they were doing that stuff.' 
If we had decisions to make here that were based on the employees of the Federal Government saying these are things we shouldn't be doing and the American public telling us, `Why were you doing those things,' we would cut them and nobody would complain. 
That is not how it works, though, in Government. If you allow it to happen, what gets cut in Government are the things that are the most visible. Call it the `athletic team syndrome.' If you want to really make an impact, you threaten to cut the athletic team in a small school, and that will get a furor bigger than anything you ever imagined, and it will be reinstituted. Not only will it be reinstituted, but I have this principle of government that if it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting to. So you not only reinstitute into the budget what happened, you put a little bit more money into that. 
We had that example in Yellowstone Park where they were $80,000 short on a $19 million budget, and they asked for extra money and threatened to close down our park early. Now, that is a major economic, as well as recreation, benefit to the entire United States, and particularly to those of us in Montana and Wyoming. 
If we had a manager who was short a few dollars who said they needed more money or had to close down early, we would probably fire the manager. 
We need strategic planning so that we can make the decisions and be sure that the things that should not be done are not being done. 
We talk about capital budgeting. We have to be sure that capital budgeting is not just building another loophole into the system, that it is good accounting. We need to have good accounting. We need to have good accounting to protect Social Security. 
Social Security right now is being called a trust fund. But it is not the fund with money stuck out there being invested on behalf of the person who paid it in so that when they retire there will be a guarantee of that money being there. It is money that is flowing through the system. It is money that is being paid out as it comes in with some small amounts being left over. Now, $80 billion this year sounds like a lot of money to me. And it is a lot of money. But it is a tittle in the budget for what needs to be put in if we are going to have an actuarially sound Social Security System. 
Not only should we be capital budgeting, not only should we be paying off the national debt, we should be making our trust funds into true trust funds. That is good Government. That is what I am interested in. If we are going to save Social Security, we are going to have to do adequate budgeting to build it up to some point in time where it is actuarially sound. 
Mr. President, the Feinstein amendment creates a loophole to the balanced budget constitutional amendment. As I mentioned when I started this speech, you can drive an interstate through it. The Feinstein amendment actually harms the balanced budget amendment because it ultimately will increase debt. It is a license to increase debt. 
Congress has been borrowing dollars to no end in order to deficit spend. And that is the problem. The Feinstein amendment does not tell us how we will pay back the bonds for capital spending. It puts no limitation on the bonds for Federal spending. It has no oversight for the bonds for capital spending. It is more and more debt. I yield the floor.

I appreciate the efforts that have gone into this amendment, but I am very concerned about a couple of the areas we have been talking about, the largest of which is the capital budget area in this. 
When we talk about capital budget--I have read what the President had in his budget message about capital budgeting. With the definitions that I see that appear in this bill, what we are talking about is putting anything that we can call a capital investment off budget; and by putting it off budget, it removes itself from having to be a part of the formula. I would like more clarification on that term. 
There is also wording on that which says that net borrowing and the disposition of major public physical capital assets would be excluded from the receipts. I am concerned about how we handle some of the disposition of major physical capital assets. One of those we are talking about is selling the spectrum. That is one-time revenue. I am very concerned that we may take one-time revenue and use it to buy recurring types of things in the budget. That is why I, too, have been asking for capital budgeting and, more important, cash flow budgeting, so that we know that when we are getting a one-time revenue, we are matching that up with a one-time expenditure. 
If we have net borrowing and the disposition of major public physical capital assets excluded, what's the mechanism for handling that? What's the budget phenomenon for handling that? Everybody has to have capital budgets, as has been mentioned here today. Unfortunately, the Federal Government is the only entity that doesn't have to have oversight--unless we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Then we, too, will have to have oversight. 
I mentioned this morning that, as a mayor, we had capital budgeting, cash flow budgets, and performance budgets. It is very important not only to building what needed to be built, but to paying off the debt for what we built. I mentioned that the city I was mayor of is now one of the few debt-free cities in the United States. That comes from good planning. 
In the debate we have had on the balanced budget constitutional amendment, we are not talking about paying off the debt that we have already incurred. We are not talking about planning to pay off what we have already incurred on behalf of the future generations--those kids and grandkids that we keep talking about, as well as the parents and grandparents that are relying on Social Security. We have to balance the budget to take care of our kids, grandkids, parents, and grandparents, as well as ourselves. 
There is a lot at stake in this. Unless we build in some oversight for ourselves, something that forces us to pay back loans, then all we are doing is giving ourselves a license to spend. We are coming up with another risky gimmick that will let us slip things into a category and not have to account for them. That is not the purpose of capital budgeting. I have even heard some reference, in capital budgeting, to putting things into a capital budget that would be social investments. I don't know how you pay off the social investments any different way than you pay for any other expenditure under the budget. That, in my opinion, is not a capital budgeting thing. That is an expense budgeting item. I think there has to be a distinction made there. 
I am really worried that section 7 of this bill will give us a license to move things from the normal budgeting process to a capital budgeting process and kind of forget about how we handle the payback on that. Somebody mentioned earlier that if you buy a home, you are doing capital budgeting. You are, but you have oversight. The banker sets up specific parameters for you to be able to get the loan. If you don't meet those parameters, he is not going to be a happy fellow. What we are trying to do here is set up some parameters for ourselves. Capital budgeting, cash flow budgeting, and performance budgeting need to be done. Those are part of an enabling act of a clean balanced budget amendment. 
One of the problems that we have in this body, I think, is that we think of things more as a Christmas list, and I know that at Christmas time I delight in going through the catalogs that come in and seeing what things I like. There has never been a limit to the number of things that a person could pick--particularly when they are children. We talk about balancing budgets, and every one of us wants to balance the budget. Individually, we say that. It is collectively that we seem to run into the problem. The balanced budget constitutional amendment will take care of that. It will force us to uphold the Constitution of the United States. It will force us to put parameters on ourselves. 
Everybody wants to buy everything, and they want to buy it right now. Good budgeting will set up some parameters that will help us with that. I am glad we are thinking about good budgeting, good accounting techniques, because we need to start setting up our Social Security trust fund under some better accounting techniques, so that we are recognizing some of the actuarial differences that are there. It is good to be thinking about that. It is a must that we do that. Right now, we are building up some incredible actuarial debts that we are not recognizing at all. We owe about $9.3 trillion to the Social Security fund. If we put the same kind of parameters on ourselves that we put on business--we tell business they have to set up a trust fund, and it has to have the amount of money necessary to pay for the people who are retiring at the time they retire. But we don't put that parameter on ourselves. The balanced budget constitutional amendment will put those kinds of things on the line to be done. We will have to follow the promises we made in the campaign. 
When I campaigned, we talked a lot about balancing the budget. When the President talked, he talked a lot about balancing the budget. In his State of the Union speech, he said, `We need to balance the budget, but we don't need a balanced budget amendment. All we need is action.' Then we got a budget that was not in balance. We did not get the action to go with the words. I made a promise during my campaign that I would vote for the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I knew what that was at the time, and I am here to do that. 
The people of America want us to protect the future for our kids and our grandkids. Our kids want us to end the child abuse of taxation without representation, cosigning on notes for them without their permission. That is what we are doing by balancing the budget. I want to say that we either balance the budget--and I think we need the discipline based on these two stacks of 28 years of unbalanced budgets. We need the discipline of a balanced budget constitutional amendment. If we do not balance that budget we will be the longest running game show, and we will wind up with the lowest possible ratings. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his comments, his answers, and his passion. We share that passion for this country. I am pleased to be in the entering class with him. 
I appreciate the approach that he has taken was not set on a course to scare anybody but to get something done, and I really appreciate that. I am appreciative also of the talk that we are having here on this floor about good accounting systems. That is of the utmost necessity for our country and for us. 
The reason it is important for us is to know exactly where we are. I pledge I will work with the Senator from New Jersey to get those kinds of accounting procedures so that we can do the kinds of things we need to do for this United States and do it within the constraints of a balanced budget so we are not continuing to pass on things to our kids and our grandkids. 
I will remind everybody that we cannot go into a capital budget situation without the clarification that we are not just creating another loophole. When I was in the legislature, one of the biggest frustrations I had was that we would propose the bill, and I knew there were people listening to that proposition who were already designing loopholes in the bill, ways to get around what we were doing and not sharing with us the ways to get around what we were trying to do. That is what we have to overcome, with the immense responsibility that we have in amending the Constitution. 
I think the original amendment has that capability. I think it is important that we vote for the original amendment, not the substitute, but that under any circumstance we do have a balanced budget constitutional amendment that will preserve this country for ourselves, our kids, and our grandkids, and make sure that we are taking care of our parents and our grandparents. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have appreciated the history lesson in preserving the Social Security system. I wish that the history lesson included a much better ending than where the Senator ended. I wish that the Senator's amendment included an ending for where we are going. The Senator's chart goes out to the year 2010. I think he could have carried it out to the year 2019 and had a pretty good-looking chart. It starts to curve off the other end if you get past 2010. So he is showing the best of the best, the best times for building up money that should be in a reserve for Social Security. He is leaving off the time that it starts to taper off. 
And the Senator is leaving off the real lie of a substitute amendment that says take Social Security off budget. The Senator is leaving out the part where we have to pay in for my generation to draw the money out. The Senator is talking about a short-term solution rather than a longer term solution. We have to have a long-term solution. 
I appreciate the efforts the Senator went to when he was in the House. We have to have a long-term solution for that. And we have to do it through enabling legislation so that it doesn't just cover from now till the best of times but covers from now till the best of times through the worst of times. We need to have an accounting system for Social Security that is honest with our seniors. 
One of the things I have been doing through this debate is to mention that we are not even talking about what the true cost is out there of making this system actuarially sound, of putting the same kind of requirement on this retirement fund that we have forced on every business retirement fund in this country, one that includes annual audits to make sure that we are not lying with those business pensions the way we are lying with Social Security. 
We tell the businesses of this country that they are going to take their pension funds and they are going to contribute to those pension funds to the extent that the money will be there at the time that the person retires so that they will have an annuity that lasts through the rest of their lifetime. There is a variety of them. Some of them have COLA's with them, some of them do not have COLA's with them. But there is an honest attempt by the Senate and the U.S. Government to force them to have money on hand, true money on hand, true trust funds that will pay those people through the time they expect to be paid. Then we turn around and we say, well, that is not the requirement for us. The Senator is trying to go to that in the amendment, but he does not get all the way. He only gets through the good times and we do not talk about the future times.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the constitutional amendment that I support recognizes the red that is out there on the end as well as the green and recognizes a need to stop doing to Social Security what that huge green there shows at the present time. I am saying that we need to start recognizing Social Security honestly, not calling it off budget so we can force things into Social Security in future years by merely naming them `Social Security' and not having to account for them in the deficit--to recognize them honestly. 
Our seniors think that there is a trust fund out there, that there is money out there that will continue to fund them. I am always fascinated when I see the articles which suggest that we should privatize Social Security. If we tried to privatize it, we would recognize that it does not have the money there; that the money is not there to be able to do it because we have this system of taking the money that is paid in now and spending it at the moment that it is paid in, with a piddly surplus. And when you look at the future of Social Security, that little green line there is not a big surplus. It is $1.3 trillion, but that is not a big surplus. The actuarial liability on the Social Security system is $9.2 trillion. 
This is money that people expect to be there. We are giving the impression that it is there. This balanced budget constitutional amendment is not a constitutional amendment just for the next few years. It is a balanced budget constitutional amendment hopefully for the rest of the history of the United States, and it will require us to have good accounting. 
As an accountant, I have been fascinated with all of the debate that we have had in this process to talk about things that we should be doing as a nation. This is the place we have to start, not by scaring our seniors but by answering our seniors, not by scaring our seniors but by setting up a system where they understand the system and where it is and help us to force the kind of accounting, the kind of disclosure that will help to assure that that money will be there, not just for the ones on the system now but for you and me and the generations to come. 
I have explained before that the kids in this country, if you ask them if they are going to get Social Security, will agree that they are more likely to see an unidentified flying object, than to see $1 of their Social Security money. 
They already believe they are not going to get this money, and they are paying 7.45 percent of their paycheck, every time they get one, into Social Security. And that is being matched by their employer for another 7.45 percent. That is almost 15 percent. That would be one tidy pension fund if it were truly a pension fund. 
I keep asking, if we do not have good accounting for this, beyond the year 2010, not just for the present time, will not that next generation cause a revolution in this country if they are paying, and there are estimates that they will be paying 84 percent of their wages in taxes--that includes their Social Security taxes, 84 percent of their taxes, and at a point that will only be going to pay interest on the national debt. It will not build another road that we have been talking about in capital budgeting. It will not add to the defense of this country that we have been talking about. It will not provide anything for education that we have been talking about. It will pay interest on the national debt. 
Now, if you and I were paying all of our taxes, and they are not nearly as high as what we are talking about those kids paying, if we were paying all of that and it was only paying interest on the national debt, what would we do? We would say we paid into that fund. How come we are not going to get it? Is anybody entitled to it? I am afraid there could be a revolutionary generation there. They may do it calmly and precisely by joining this body and the one down there and the Presidency and taking that away because they will be paying taxes that they have never see. That is what they already believe. 
If we move Social Security off budget, if we quit having to account for it as part of the deficit--we can add more stringent requirements to the balanced budget constitutional amendment that is before us, we can add more stringent requirements to that to recognize what has been said here, and it can be done through a normal statute, the enabling act, for instance. We can put the enabling legislation in it that will take care of recognizing the surplus spending we are having now and the huge deficits we are going to have in the future. 
I remember not too long ago sitting in on the President's State of the Union Message, and I was kind of surprised when he got to page 2, about halfway down the page, after he had said all the things about how we needed to be bipartisan and how we needed to balance the budget and we did not need a balanced budget constitutional amendment to do that; we just needed action, and then a couple of days later, making use of the extra time that he was given by this body and the one across the hall, he presented a budget. And was it balanced? No, it was not balanced. Did it do with Social Security what the Senator is talking about doing? No, it did not do it. 
Do we need other constraints to make sure that there is good accounting for Social Security? To make absolutely sure, as all of us want to do, that there is Social Security there? No, it did not recognize that surplus from Social Security in such a way as to preserve it as a surplus. 
I have said before that, individually, we all promise a balanced budget; collectively we just don't seem to be able to get there. We have to do that, for our kids and our grandkids. 
And we cannot ignore the seniors in 2019. On behalf of the seniors, we do need to recognize the debt, we do need to recognize what is happening now and into the future. And we are only going to do that by legislation forced on us by a balanced budget constitutional amendment and one that goes further than what is being done here. I join in protecting Social Security, as would all the other Senators, but not through one that only solves half the problem. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the reason that debt has to increase is a requirement that we be honest with those seniors. That is being honest. That is the utilization of those funds, which are a trust fund, which are an intergovernmental transfer that has to be recognized as a part of the Federal debt under the accounting system that we use. It is not an adequate accounting system to show where the money has gone.

Mr. ENZI. Madam President, in the short time that I have been here, and this is my first year in the Senate, which means I have been here about 6 weeks, this is not even the first time we have debated and voted on this particular issue. We have had it thrown out several different ways, talked about several different ways, but it is always the same thing that we are redoing. 
Of course, one of the reasons we do that and one of the reasons we exclude those other trust funds we talked about is that this is where the people are. It isn't this is where the dollars are, because we are talking about deficits in the year 2019, we are talking about people who rely on Social Security. There are people who need it badly, and they scare easily at the thought of losing it, and should. We are right there worrying about it with them, but we can't accept something that is half an answer. 
I mentioned that we have voted on this three separate times. I think we talked about it most of the ways that we can, but I want to try and answer some of the questions. 
Madam President, the balanced budget amendment does, indeed, require a balanced budget. Outlays must not exceed receipts under section 1 of this resolution. But it is also true that gross debt may still increase, even if the budget is balanced. That is because the Government's exchange of securities for Social Security taxes is counted as gross debt, and we had better count it somewhere. I don't think there is anybody out there who wants us to take those funds and not account for them somehow. 
We passed a law that says that those Social Security funds have to be invested in the Federal Government. That is where they are. The way that we account for them is to show them as Government debt. Should we loan them and not show them as Government debt? It is merely an accounting or bookkeeping notation of what one agency of the Government owes another agency. It is analogous to a corporation buying back stocks and debentures. Such stocks and bonds are considered retired obligations that, once paid, have no economic or fiscal significance. Thus, if we enact a balanced budget constitutional amendment, the debt the United States owes to everyone, but itself, will stop growing. It will not stop growing as long as we have the Social Security funds paid out as an investment in the Federal Government. 
This type of debt, termed `net debt' or debt held by the public, is legally enforceable, and it better be. But if we don't balance that budget, the funds will not be there to pay this legal debt when the time for the legal debt comes due. Those bonds that we have in that great storeroom called Social Security, the bonds that have already been loaned to the Federal Government, have to be paid off at the time they come due. We 
will not be able to do that without a balanced budget. 
If the debt zooms because of interest payments of debt, which last year amounted to $250 billion, budget deficits balloon with all the dire economic consequences, and we have been talking about those economic consequences and the advantages of a balanced budget. To assure that budgets will be balanced, unless extraordinary situations arise, debt held by the public cannot be increased unless there is a three-fifths of the whole number of each House concurring. 
That net debt is considered to be a far greater economic significance than the gross debt is a widely held truism among economists. Indeed, in the study `Analytical Perspectives: Budget of the United States Government Fiscal Year 1998,' the Clinton administration concludes that net debt, or borrowing from the public, whether by the Treasury or by some other Federal agency, has a significant impact on the economy. 
On the other hand, the study also maintains that gross debt, or debt issued to Government accounts, does not have any of the economic effects of borrowing from the public. It is merely an internal transaction between two accounts within the Government itself. We have to account for the debt. We have to account for it honestly, and we have to balance the budget more than past the year 2010. A balanced budget constitutional amendment is for all time until altered by us, and we don't do that on a regular basis. It is extremely tough. 
Our forefathers did provide a mechanism for doing it. That is the process we are going through now, and they made it an extremely tough one, with a two-thirds vote and then ratification by three-fourths of the States. 
If this balanced budget didn't have so much backing, would there be all of this opposition to having it? In checking, if just the Senators from the States that oppose the balanced budget did not ratify this, there would never be a balanced budget constitutional amendment. But I know from traveling out there that those States are saying we live under a balanced budget constitutional amendment. It works. We don't have to go through all of these other funny little accounting gimmicks to get there. The people know when it is balanced. You don't hear of lawsuits on a regular basis dealing with their balanced budget constitutional amendments. Consequently, they will ratify this if they can get Senators from those States to back a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
I think that in a number of years, if not right now--I do think it will happen right now. I think this is the most important debate we could possibly be having in our lifetime because of the consequences in our lifetime and for generations to come. This is the most important thing we can be discussing. I do think if the last election didn't make the difference, the next election will make the difference, 
because people have promised their people at home that they will vote for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. We have to move on those promises so we can meet the expectations of the people at home, the people who voted for us, the people who sent us here with a trust in the political process. It is up to us now to fulfill that trust. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I feel compelled to speak a little bit on debt. That seems to be what we are talking about here today. We have talked about the Social Security debt for quite a while. There does not seem to be a lot of willingness to agree on some of the basics on it. 
Again, I want to explain that if we are paying our Social Security in and that money is being invested in the U.S. Government, if we do not recognize it as debt, we are lying to the people right now. We have to admit what we have and what we are using. 
The solution that is suggested by this substitute amendment is one that wants to take the Social Security numbers and just recognize them while there is this surplus, but really only recognize them while there is a surplus, to scare people about Social Security. We really ought to be worrying about Social Security. 
Debt is really a difficult thing to explain unless it is your own. Then it is even scarier. We heard a little explanation of State debt here a moment ago. State debt is a whole lot different than this Federal debt we are talking about, because in every State that has a balanced budget, they are expected to pay the debt back. 
We have yet to talk about paying debt back. We have a national debt, but I do not recall us saying that we are going to start budgeting not only to balance it, but we are going to balance it and pay back some of the national debt. We put that kind of requirement on the States. The States put that kind of requirement on themselves. They agree that if they borrow money, they have to agree to pay it back by a time specific. 
They have covenants. They have to meet covenants on those bonds, which means they put a little extra away. Sometimes they have to fund things up front. So when they are talking about capital debts, they are talking about a whole different ballgame than we are talking about. They are talking about the same one that that mortgage lender is doing when he enters into a home loan. When you go out and buy a house, you do not just ask to pay the interest and expect to get a house loan. You do not expect to be able to buy two or three houses, if you feel like it, and just pay the interest. The banker expects you to pay the loan back. 
I talked about municipal governments this morning. They are expected to pay the loans back. They are forced to pay the loans back. Many of them are forced to have a balanced budget. It is kind of interesting how their balanced budget estimates work. Theirs are a little more conservative than ours. They say, unless you can show that the economy has declined and you will not get as much revenue as last year, you will use last year's revenue estimates. That is pretty conservative. 
If we had to say that in a growing economy we had to use last year's numbers, we would be able to pay back some of the national debt with what was left in a growing economy. We would be putting aside some in the good times to take care of the bad times. 
That is the kind of an accounting system that we have to get to. That is the kind of budgeting that we have to get to if we are going to be fair, not only with today's generation alone, but with the ones of the future. We cannot keep buying the things out of the Christmas book that we want to have and expect our kids and grandkids to pay for it. 
That is what we are doing at the moment. Any way we try and phrase Social Security so that we only want to recognize the money through the good times, not adjust for it in the bad times, we are not properly accounting for Social Security. We have to take care of it past 2010. The amendment before the Senate only takes care of it through 2010 and then allows us to lie about it, to ignore it, to not have to worry about it. 
That is when the bonds come due. That is when the debt comes due from raising the debt limits over these years. I want to protect my seniors. I want to be sure there is money there in the year 2019 as well. 
I yield the floor but retain the balance of my time.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for granting me this time. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that is sponsored by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. The amendment would strike the language from section 6 of the balanced budget constitutional amendment that permits Congress to rely on budget estimates when drafting the implementing language pursuant to the ratification of the amendment. 
As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I know that no budget can be predicted to the penny more than a year in advance. I would like to see that extended out to 2 years in advance. If we demand better estimates, we will get better estimates. If more is riding on the estimates, the estimates will be better. The estimators' performance and ours will be judged. The very heart of budgeting means making estimates before the money is spent. There is no way to do it after the money is spent. You have to do it in advance. Advance means estimates. Without the use of the estimates of future outlays and receipts, we will be unable to draft implementing legislation that keeps us within the boundaries of the balanced budget amendment. 
As an accountant, I am fascinated with the budget discussion because we are talking about numbers. We are talking about balancing budgets. We are talking about formats that will provide us with the most information possible. And we are doing it in the context of a real budget, dealing with real people. We are doing it in the context of a history where we have only had one balanced budget in 40 years. We have not balanced the budget in 28 years. 
Some very valid accounting concerns have been raised here in the debate by opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I have heard reference to the need for capital budgets. I have heard reference to a need for Social Security to be off budget. I have heard reference to the need to take care of accounting problems that happen during recessions. As an accountant, I applaud this insight into the need for new accounting methods. We need to have cash flow budgets so that as cash arrives the purchases can be made without extensive deficits. It is just good business. A balanced budget amendment will force us to have a better accounting system and to even have better estimates. 
I have heard debate about the concern with the Judiciary Committee's definitions for estimates. The committee stated that estimates, for example, `means good faith, responsible and reasonable estimates made with an honest intent to implement section 1.' I would add that generally accepted principles would also ask that they be conservative estimates. We all know that there is no way to be absolutely accurate about estimates. We have to do the best we can to estimate outlays and receipts and do it routinely at the same day each year. 
If we really want to talk about problems with definitions, `off budget' is a fascinating accounting term. In fact, in my accounting references I couldn't even find that term. I have to say from listening to discussions that there doesn't seem to be a lot of consensus on what that really means. 
It looks like we found another catchword that scares senior citizens and scares people and gives us a hook not to vote on this. As one who daily approaches being a senior I want to see us get that rhetoric out of that term. We give the impression that Social Security has enough money at the moment. We talk about the surpluses going into Social Security and being used in the budget. Without estimates of outlays and receipts, it would be impossible to gauge the problems that currently affect the very existence of the Social Security system. 
Let's talk a little bit more about definitions. I think that accountants frown on the Federal term `surplus' revenue. Surplus implies more than what is needed. That is definitely not the case with Social Security. Social Security is a trust fund. But we give the impression that that money is being set aside in a special account for seniors so that when they retire there will be money to be drawn out in their name. That is not even close to what actually happens. 
We don't have a crystal ball, only reasonable estimates from which to work. The President and Congress currently use estimates and budget planning. The Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget already give budget estimates each year. It has been pointed out how accurate they are. One is more conservative than the other. They correct the estimate twice during the year to ensure their accuracy. Congress ultimately decides how to balance the difference between the estimates. 
We need to have a system where we can see how far in debt we are. And we need to do that not just for Social Security but for every single trust fund that we have, and the budget. We either have to change the accounting system, account for funds honestly and show how much deficit there is, or rename them so that they are not called trust funds. Perhaps we should do both. 
We are not snake oil salesmen here. Meeting the requirements of the balanced budget constitutional amendment will require Congress to go about their business with a great level of accountability. Spending and borrowing decisions must be deliberate because every decision will impact the requirement of this balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
I think those people who are opposing the balanced budget constitutional amendment know in their hearts that this one will pass and will also have more swift ratification by the States than most of the other amendments to the Constitution. 
Why will that happen? First, most of the States already have a balanced budget constitutional amendment. They work under them, and they know that they work. And, incidentally, those work with estimates. They know their limitation and the type of problems that develop from it. The States understand that problems are not a detriment to the United States having a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
The concern of the inaccuracy of the estimates is overblown. 
The data that are often used are generated months to over a year in advance to the end of the fiscal year. In fact, the Federal Reserve uses its own estimates to help set its own policy. It also makes mistakes. For example, in the July 1996 Humphrey-Hawkins banking deregulation hearing, Chairman Alan Greenspan predicted the GDP would grow at about 2.5 to 2.75 percent. Instead, it grew by about 3.4 percent. Quite a difference; billions in difference. Is that to say that the Fed should not use estimates because they do no more than identify the economic trends and provide decisionmakers with useful information? Yes, an estimate is an educated guess. Where else would we start? Where else would the Fed start in determining its policy? 
I think that most people in this body realize that a constitutional amendment will pass and get ratified by the States. If we didn't believe that it would be ratified by the States, this would be a real easy debate. But we know that the people of the States want it and the States will respond. If just those States with one or more Senators opposing the balanced budget constitutional amendment did not ratify the constitutional amendment, it would never become a constitutional amendment. So if those Senators' States did not ratify it where one or more Senators were opposing it, we wouldn't have the constitutional amendment. If we did not have appropriate legislation, those people in those States would not have to raise the confusion that we are having raised right here today; that is, to get a hook so that they can explain a vote that is very difficult to explain back home. 
The people understand from their own experience that you can't spend more than you take in. Almost every school kid above third grade is able to explain that to me--that, if you spend more money than you take in, you go broke. By third grade they have already had enough experience to realize this fact of life. It has been said that we can learn much from children. Children focus on problems in more simple terms. There is a difference between being simplistic and being simple. 
If you went to your banker and said, `I want to borrow money to buy a house, and I don't want to have to pay anything but the interest for the rest of my life,' do you think you would get that loan? No, you wouldn't. But that is what we are doing right now with the national debt. By not balancing the budget, the Federal Government has not been good about limiting or disciplining itself in any way. 
How does this relate to the constitutional amendment? I am suggesting that, if we limit ourselves by a balanced budget constitutional amendment, we will concentrate more on what we really do well. We will have more people participating and less people expecting Government to do things for them, more caring concern for our elders, and more concentration on our children's and grandchildren's welfare, if we have a balanced budget amendment. 
Thank you.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we will have several more of my colleagues here to discuss how the balanced budget amendment benefits children. 
I will begin by saying that as a new Senator, I am in awe of these surroundings. Every day I reflect on the history that has taken place in this Chamber. I think of the people who have been here before me and hear them referred to in speeches on a daily basis. 
Much of the history of this great Nation has been shaped in this Chamber. Every day we are in session history is being made. Right now we are debating the balanced budget constitutional amendment. That may be the most important piece of legislation to be debated during my lifetime because of the implications it has for the future of our country. 
A new revolution may be taking place in this country. A few years ago, I was given a book by my pastor to read. It was a scholarly review of social cycles in the history of the United States. The baby boomers were one of those cycles. I am part of that. They were concerned primarily for themselves but also for others as long as there was something in it for them. It revealed how in the history of the United States there have been three recurring cycles. But following each period when we tried to be sure we took care of ourselves and instituted programs to make sure others were taken care of, provided we were included, that generation was followed by a reactionary generation, and the reactionary generation took away the `gifts' of the previous generation. 
In last week's balanced budget debate, we heard a lot of comments about Social Security. I am mentioning this reactionary generation because I want to make sure we protect Social Security not just today but for the time to come. All of us here are concerned about Social Security, and to say otherwise is just political hogwash. But the only way to protect Social Security is to include it in the balanced budget constitutional amendment. That is why the President's budget proposal and every budget prior to that included Social Security in the budget. We cannot continue to ignore the interests of our children and grandchildren--members of that reactionary agenda. 
What does the incredible debt that we have built up have to do with future generations? The Federal debt is $5.3 trillion. None of us understand how much $5.3 trillion is. But the reactionary generation that follows will learn, and they will learn all too soon. As they become saddled with tremendous debt, they will realize what the magnitude of how much $5.3 trillion really is. 
Already this reactionary generation says that they have a better chance of seeing an unidentified flying object than they have of seeing $1 of their Social Security money when they retire. They see no hope for the future, and they look forward to a lifetime of putting in 7.45 percent or more of their paycheck and having that matched by their employer with another 7.45 percent. That is 15 percent that could have been their earnings, that could have been money in their pockets or in their own retirement accounts. When they realize that they will not receive a dollar of that money, what do you suppose their reaction will be? Will they protect Social Security for those already in the program? Will they care? Will there be a legislative revolution? 
As an accountant, I am fascinated with the budget discussion because we are talking about numbers, and that is exciting. We are talking about balancing budgets. We are talking about formats that will provide us with the most information possible, and we are doing it in the context of a real budget dealing with real people. 
We are doing it in the context of a history where we have only balanced the budget once in 40 years--and that was 28 years ago. 
Some very valid accounting concerns have been raised here in debate by opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I have heard reference to the need for capital budgeting. I have heard reference to a need for Social Security to be off budget. I have heard reference to the need to take care of accounting problems that happen during recessions. As an accountant, I applaud this insight into the need for new accounting methods. 
Not only am I an accountant but I used to be the mayor of Gillette, WY, as it went through a boom and increased in population about two and a half times. I know from having been through both kinds of economic cycles that growth presents many of the same problems that recession causes. Under both situations a capital budget is required. We really do need Federal capital budgets and cash-flow management budgets. We need to list all of the capital purchases, vehicles, buildings, etc., that this Government needs to buy for the next 1 year, 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 50 years. I have found out that many agencies or departments have no idea how much capital they have. We need to have cash-flow budgets so that as the cash arrives the purchases can be made without extensive deficits. That is good business. 
When I heard the Democratic leader speaking about capital budgets last week, I got excited. That is the kind of accounting that we should have already had. But, this kind of accounting has nothing to do with passing the balanced budget constitutional amendment. It is just good business. Whether we have a capital budget or not, we need a balanced budget amendment. 
Last week I heard a lot of debate about the need to take Social Security off budget. Off budget is a fascinating accounting term. In fact in my accounting references I could not even find that term. And I have to say from listening to the discussions that there does not seem to be a lot of consensus as to what off budget really means. 
It looks like we found a catch word that scares senior citizens and makes everyone think this will save Social Security. As one who daily approaches being a senior, I want to see us get the rhetoric out of that term. We give the impression that Social Security has enough money at the moment. We talk about the surpluses going into Social Security and being used in the budget. 
Accountants frown at the word `surplus' revenue. Surplus implies more than what is needed. That is not the case with the Social Security trust fund. We give the impression that money is being put aside in a special account for our seniors so that when they retire there will be money to be drawn out in their names. That is not even close to what actually happens. 
In order for the money that people are paying into Social Security today to be available for them when they retire, the system must be actuarially sound. That means that the money going in now at the rate of investment allowed on that fund has to generate enough revenue so there will be a payout for the period of time promised. We have promised to pay out money for the remainder of a person's life at not only the rate that he or she is entitled to at the time they retire, but also with cost-of-living allowances. 
We have already passed laws in this country that force businesses doing pension funds to make their funds actuarially sound. They have to build a fund that at the time of retirement will have enough money in it that can pay the benefits for that person for the promised amount of time which is usually the balance of his lifetime. That is the law. Businesses are in the process of meeting that at an extreme cost to themselves. If we force businesses to keep their promises, then why do we not fulfill our promise to the same people and keep our accounts sound? 
At the present time Social Security is at least $9.3 trillion away from being actuarially sound. Do we have a way to generate that money? No. We have to perpetuate the current system. That is why we cannot privatize the system. We would bankrupt the system immediately if we allowed younger generations to take their money and put it in their own fund instead of putting it in to be paid out to our seniors immediately. 
We need to have a system where we can see how far in debt we are. And we need to do that not just for Social Security but for every single trust fund that we have. We either have to change the accounting system to account for the funds honestly and show how much of a deficit there is, or rename them so that they are not trust funds. Perhaps we should do both. 
OK, we agreed to do a system of pay in and pay out trying to build up some surpluses to take care of the coming influx of people going into retirement. But, when the baby boomers reach full retirement, the Social Security surplus will decline at a dramatic rate, eventually going broke by the year 2012. 
Yes, we need a new accounting system for Social Security. Yes, we need that system now. No, it is not a part of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. It is a part of a good government proposition and we need to grapple with it and get it under control. The issue of what accounting system to use should not determine if we vote for or against a balanced budget amendment. A new accounting system is needed, but the balanced budget amendment is essential. 
The only hope for Social Security is a balanced budget, then switch to an accounting system that will realistically deal with the actuarial needs of Social Security so that we can protect it for future generations. Otherwise we will have a revolution that will take away seniors' Social Security. 
Last week I also saw many copies of the pocket Constitution of the United States being held up and explained. I too, carry my own copy of the Constitution of the United States. It was given to me some years ago by a district judge when I was in the State legislature. 
When I was mayor, on Constitution Day, I used to give all members of the city council a copy of the Constitution and encourage them to read it. Sometimes we read it as a part of the proceedings of the city council meeting. This document is an astonishing document. The insight by our forefathers was incredible. But this debate has also raised some constitutional issues. 
I have heard discussion that some people in this body consider this to be a draft. It fascinates me, that, with the exception of one single provision, the Founders of this Constitution considered it to be a draft. In article 5, instructions are given on how a change in the Constitution can be made. They made it difficult, but possible to change. The balanced budget constitutional amendment has to pass by a two-thirds vote in each House and then it must be ratified by three-fourths of the States. 
I think those people who are opposing a balanced budget constitutional amendment know in their hearts that this time it will pass and will also have swift ratification by the States. If we did not believe it would be ratified by the States, this would be an easy debate. But we know the people of the States want it and the States will respond. If just those States with one or more Senators opposing the balanced budget constitutional amendment did not ratify the constitutional amendment, it would never become a constitutional amendment. 
Why will there be swift ratification? First, most of the States already have a balanced budget requirement in their Constitution. They work under the requirement and know the requirement works. They know their limitations and the types of challenges that develop from it. They understand that the challenges are not a detriment to the United States having a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
People understand from their own experience that you cannot spend more than you take in. Almost every school child above the third grade is able to explain to me that if you spend more money than you take in you go broke. It has been said that we can learn much from children. Children focus on problems in more simple terms. Congress has not yet learned what the children know. The voters want us to stop spending their money they have not even earned yet. Our children and grandchildren plead with us to balance the budget and quit cosigning on their behalf for this mountain of debt. 
Another argument that I have heard in this debate is the need to adjust changes or, using a new term, glitches in the economy. $5.3 trillion worth of debt has turned people into unbelievers about the paternal role of Government in our lives. We have already wrestled with the $5.3 trillion worth of experiments that wound up with these glitches in the economy. Where has it taken us? What do we have to show for it? The people know the Government has little control over the economy. 
I have heard the argument that families do not balance their budgets because they borrow for future such situations, and they do not pay the debt off each year. I agree, they do not. But I do hasten to point out that they at least pay off a little bit of the debt every year. Right now we should not only balance the budget, we should include in that balanced budget an enabling legislation provision to pay off the national debt. 
If you went to your banker and said, `I want to borrow money to buy a house, but I don't want to have to pay anything but the interest for the rest of my life,' would you get the loan? No, you would not. But that is what Government is doing. The Government is saying, we want you, the American people, to be our bankers, but all we want to do is pay the interest. I can foresee a time when the interest may amount to more than all of the other spending programs, so it will be tough to even pay the interest, and we still will not be paying a nickel on the national debt. Will the next generation be reactionary if they pay exorbitant taxes and cannot buy anything but interest? 
This does not begin to mention who finances our debts. We are fiscally controlled to a limited degree by foreign interests because of the large increase in their securities holdings. This weakens our economy and independence because the money is taken out of the United States. The interest on the Federal debt increased from 9 percent of total outlays in fiscal year 1980 to 15 percent in fiscal year 1995. 
The Federal Government has not been good about limiting or disciplining itself in any way. We understand how happy constituents get when we throw money at them and their wants. We also understand how disappointed and a little bit angry they sometimes get when they are not given things. 
I was in the Wyoming Legislature for 10 years. Halfway through that time, I moved from the house to the senate. At that time the State senate imposed a new rule on itself. We have a very limited time for meeting in Wyoming. We meet for 20 days in a budget session, which is every other year, and 40 days in a regular session. Now we save 2 of those days each time in case the Governor were to veto something, we could call ourselves back into session and override it. So we spend 18 days one year and 38 days the next, and we avoid all special sessions. 
In recent years one thing has happened that has helped, and that is a rule that we imposed on ourselves to limit the number of bills that any one Senator can introduce in a session. We said that in a budget year, a Senator could only introduce three bills, and in a regular session a Senator could only introduce seven bills. We spent a lot of hours talking about limiting our own right to submit bills. Those who spoke most vehemently against it were the ones who turned in the most bills. It was not unusual for anybody to turn in 30 bills in a regular session. We passed a rule in spite of the opposition. Today the biggest supporters of that rule are the ones who before the rule turned in the most bills. 
Why the change? The ones who turned in the most bills discovered two things. First, their constituents were more pleased with the bill that passed than one that was merely introduced. Introducing and working a few bills resulted in a higher percentage of bills that passed. Second, maybe most importantly, it was much easier to say no to a constituent for a new bill if there was a prohibition against the number of bills allowed to be introduced. 
How does that relate to a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget? I am suggesting that, if we limit ourselves by a balanced budget constitutional amendment, we will concentrate more on what we really do well, and the things that we choose to do we will do well. We can have the America of our dreams. We will have more people participating, we will have less people expecting Government to do things for them, we will have more care and concern for our elders, and we will have more concentration on our children's and our grandchildren's welfare. 
We have an opportunity now to show that we can care for our parents and our grandparents and will provide for our children and our grandchildren. We can move to an honest system of accounting so we can end the deficits and pay down the debt to show that we really believe that the future of America is upon us now. We can preserve this as a land of opportunity for future generations. The challenge is now. Do we have the courage or do we need a revolt from the reactionary generation? Please help me to pass the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I will urge all Americans to write and call your Representatives and Senators and tell them to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Passing it 5 years from now will not suffice. We need action now.  
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1. When we vote on Senator Durbin's amendment later today, I will urge my colleagues to oppose that measure. 
The amendment of the Senator from Illinois seeks to skirt the three-fifths majority vote required by Senate Joint Resolution 1 to approve the deficit. This gaping hole would give Congress the ability to knock the teeth out of the constitutional amendment with a simple majority vote. The three-fifths requirement was placed in the balanced budget amendment so that Congress could not run deficits except during times of war or serious threat. 
The Durbin amendment adds two additional situations and neglects to define them. In addition, it overrides the desire of a balanced budget by three-fourths of the States which would be necessary for the amendment's ratification. Senator Durbin's amendment gives Congress excuses for not balancing the budget. The American people are tired of excuses coming from Washington. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to comment on the attacks that have been continued and have increased in intensity against this commonsense amendment. 
Our opponents are conjuring up fatalistic and doomsday predictions about the future with their crystal balls. They are right to be concerned about a possible economic recession and the insolvency of our Social Security system. But they are wrong about the cause and the solution. If we fail to control our future, it will control us. We need to fear the future only if we fail to pass this amendment. 
If there were only one social injustice in America today, it would be the mountain of debt we are leaving to our kids, grandkids, and those not yet old enough to vote today. An inheritance of debt is a cruel legacy. They will be left to wonder if we failed to remember the Revolutionary battle cry, `No taxation without representation.' 
Congressman J.C. Watts stated in his recent speech: 
If things continue as they are, by the time [those people] are 25, the tax they could pay will be about 84 cents on the dollar. That's more than a shame. It's a scandal. 
I concur. Let us quit cosigning on our kids' behalf without their consent. 
The opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment say that some of us consider the Constitution to be a draft. I need to remind those opponents that the Constitution is being amended on a very regular basis without a majority vote each time it is amended by the judicial courts. 
Opponents of the amendment also use the argument that it would be unconstitutional. I have never heard anyone declare a provision in the Constitution as unconstitutional. How could that be possible? Think about it. 
Senate Joint Resolution 1 has wide bipartisan support. That is the only way we could get 62 original cosponsors to the amendment. The present administration has stated working together is the key to action. I wholeheartedly agree. We should not care who gets the credit for balancing the budget, Republicans or Democrats, Congress or the President, as long as it gets done. 
This is something that the administration pays lip service to, but then proclaimed an all-out war on the balanced budget amendment even though they submitted a proposal just a few days ago stuffed and overstuffed with new Government programs that we cannot afford. 
The President's budget purportedly brings the budget into balance by the year 2002. He has front-loaded his budget proposals with catchy, pretty little initiatives tied up in illusory little bows. 
Mr. President, you cannot fill a leaking bucket from a dry well. Americans must know that long after this President has left office, Congress will no longer be able to avoid the mess. Tax hikes loom large on the horizon for many Americans in 2002 under President Clinton's plan--the exact year that the budget amendment might take effect. 
The administration has declared war on the will of the American people as well. Let us take a look at some recent numbers from a CBS poll released February 4, 1997. When the American people were asked the question, `Do you favor a balanced budget amendment?' 76 percent of those polled said `yes.' But when they were asked if the Federal budget would be balanced by 2002, 84 percent said no. This tells me the American people do not believe that the political leaders of today have the will to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. This lack of will is what creates cynicism and apathy in the American people. 
Why don't we just give the individual States the opportunity to ratify the balanced budget amendment? Three-fourths of the States have to pass it before it becomes part of the Constitution. That is a tough test. We need to give the States this opportunity to force the Federal Government to come to grips with its finances just as the State governments are required to do. I found the best decisions are made closest to the people. The American people know best how a decision made here in Washington will affect them and their daily lives. Giving the States the opportunity to ratify the amendment would bring the budget closer to the people. 
The administration likes playing the underdog, hoping to get sympathy votes against the amendment. They are insisting this could do severe damage to some important Government programs and the economy. This is shown by the proposed budget for fiscal years 1998 through fiscal year 2002. 
The President's plan sets up Congress and future administrations to do the heavy lifting. If we are to balance the budget by 2002, drastic cuts in programs will have to be made in the 2 years after the President leaves office. The President's proposed budget acknowledges that the deficit will increase, from about $107 billion in 1996 to $121 billion in 1998. That is not responsible and courageous leadership for next year, let alone the next 50 years. Responsible leadership requires the tough decisions to be made now, instead of continuing to ignore the problem and forcing future leaders to balance the budget when a slower economy may make it more difficult to get it done. 
As the late Senator Paul Tsongas said, `There are a lot of votes in deficit spending. There are no votes in fiscal discipline.' Former Senator Paul Simon also said, `People in public office like to do popular things, and there is no popular way to balance the budget.' To these two highly esteemed former Democrat Senators, a balanced budget constitutional amendment is the only guarantee to fiscal discipline. It would require Congress and the President to make some unpopular, but desperately needed actions to control Federal spending. If we have the best economy in the post-World-War II era, why can't we balance the budget in fiscal year 1999, and make the necessary cuts now, instead of later when uncertainty of the future economic condition is greater. 
I challenge the Members of this body and the President of this great Nation to balance the budget now, while the economy is growing. This would cause the economy to flourish even more, reducing interest rates and guaranteeing investors that a balanced budget will occur. It is also Social Security's only hope. 
The Federal Government should be in the business of doing a few things well, instead of many things poorly. Our Federal budget is pockmarked with programs that do not work as intended, whose missions are obsolete, and have grown out of control. The balanced budget amendment would force the Government to prioritize programs, and then perform with better results. The American people have always been fearful of an overly intrusive and powerful Federal Government. 
There is still a certain amount of anti-federalism in each of us. The natural response to the constraints put on Government by this amendment would be a limited government. This leads me to point out the advantages of a biennial budget. A biennial budget would complement the balanced budget constitutional amendment by allowing Congress to spend more time ironing out the details of a budget. A biennial budget would also allow Congress more time for oversight, making sure the various agencies and departments are effectively, accurately, and honestly performing their mission. It would also allow longer range planning by the Federal agencies, and State and local governments. The current annual budget and budget reconciliation process causes shortsighted planning. A biennial budget would allow more time for Congress to prioritize the agencies' and departments' functions. 
American essayist, Artemus Ward said, `It ain't the things we don't know that hurt us--It's the things we do know that ain't so.' I am talking about capital budgeting. A few opponents of the amendment have called for capital budgeting. As the U.S. Senate's only accountant, I can tell you that you are not being told the whole story. 
It is misleading to speak about the need for a capital budget at the 
Federal level, as though it is an idea which has been championed for some time in this Chamber. It is being used solely as a means to confuse the issue on the appropriateness of the balanced budget amendment. The comparison has been made to the practice in State budgeting of separating capital and operating expenses, and paying for capital improvements through the method of issuing debt. The Federal budget has even been compared to the family budget and a home mortgage. 
There are some distinctions which need to be made with the practice of sound capital budgeting in our States and homes and what has occurred here. First, a plan must be in place to replace or expand facilities and equipment based on its reasonable economic life. I would question whether or not the Federal Government even has an inventory of our existing facilities and equipment, let alone a plan for its replacement or expansion. 
Second, both the States and our families borrow with a purpose, and with the full intent and capability of repayment of both the interest and the principal over a fixed period. The annual cost of this debt repayment is included within the annual budget. We not only lack a capital budget, we incur debt for day-to-day expenses. No State or family, if it hopes to remain solvent, incurs debt for the cost of operations or day-to-day living with the intent of only paying the interest. 
This is exactly what we have been doing since 1969. Given the affinity of the Federal Government to borrow for normal day-to-day living, I can only guess at the problems we could generate if we were to create additional debt to finance capital improvements. It is a reasonable premise of borrowing that you don't loan money to a person who has shown that they cannot be trusted to repay what they already owe. 
I will conclude with the famous words of Benjamin Franklin: `Work while it is called today, for you know not how much you may be hindered tomorrow. One today is worth two tomorrows; never leave that till tomorrow which you can do today.' Now is the time for hard work and seriousness. 
We must pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I urge all Americans to write or call your Representatives and Senators and tell them to pass the balanced budget amendment now. No more excuses--the future of our children and grandchildren and parents and grandparents is at stake. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the balanced budget constitutional amendment. Without that amendment, our children and grandchildren will be saddled with a mountain of debt. They will be left with no hope of fulfilling their hopes and dreams. 
I feel that it is time to correct the misleading reports that have been put forth by many of the opponents of Senate Joint Resolution 1 over the past few weeks. Their arguments are not new. They have been the same arguments for the past 20 years--actually, for almost three decades Congress has failed to balance the budget. I am standing almost in the shadow of the mountain of budgets that don't balance. That failure has led to the current fiscal mess that holds us hostage. 
But what has really kept us from a balanced budget amendment? The same old excuses and fear-mongering still prevail, scaring everyone from the children to the senior citizens of this country. 
The excuses take a little different form each year, but the same basic fears are still being played upon. The easy position to take is to continue spending the taxpayers money on feel-good programs instead of grappling with the tough issues. 
The debt we are incurring for our kids amounts to taxation without representation. We are forcing people who haven't even been born yet to cosign on a note. A balanced budget constitutional amendment would tie the hands of the spenders in DC. It doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water. In fact, it is the life cord that connects the budget to the baby. It would protect generations yet to come. 
A balanced budget will do away with the hidden taxes Americans pay in the form of higher interest rates. If we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment now, a middle-class family could easily save $1,500 a year. That is a nice raise. This is assuming a drop in mortgage rates from 7.7 to 5.7 percent, a drop in interest rates on a car loan from 9.2 to 7.2 percent, and decline in student loan rates from 8.5 to 6.5 percent. Interest rates should be 2 percent lower with a balanced budget. 
How would the financial markets view the balanced budget amendment? According to many financial market experts, such as David Malpass, the more restraint on Government spending, the better the markets will respond. Part of the reason for the bullish market is merely the suggestion of a balanced budget. Laws enforcing a balanced budget would perpetuate a bullish financial market. Currently, interest rates are low and the economy is healthy, due again in part by Congress and the President getting serious about balancing the budget. All of these positive trends are occurring as a result of just the possibility of balancing the budget. 
What about the claim that a balanced budget amendment would hobble our economy in a recession? First of all, there is a clause in the amendment that would allow Congress, by a three-fifths vote, to spend more than it takes. In an emergency situation of three-fifths vote would not be difficult to attain. Financial experts agree that recessions have occurred at times due to Federal mismanagement of monetary, tax, or regulatory policies. Mistakes are usually made when the Government intervenes too much in the private sector. The amendment has a built in method that allows the Federal Government to quickly react to these types of glitches. 
The economist John Keynes knew that Government should attempt to create a surplus in the good times and that Government must borrow during bad times. The problem with our situation is that Congress is borrowing during the bad and good, wartime and peacetime, national emergency or no emergency. Look at where we are now. We are supposed to be having the best economy in years--with a focus on reinventing and downsizing government, a huge reduction in military expenses, and a Congress and President that want to balance the budget. We lack the will and discipline, however, to ultimately balance the budget before the end of the 20th century. 
We have had commission after commission study this issue to sheer boredom. We all know that revenue is up right now for Social Security. We are also well aware that the program will start running a deficit in 2013. Let's not make political hay out of Social Security. Let's start dealing with reality. 
Opponents of the amendment want Social Security exempted or taken off budget. It is catchy wording that some senior citizens have bought hook, line and sinker. It has absolutely no consistent meaning to anyone and it provides a false sense of security. There is a vague feeling that `off budget' means that we don't want to cheat on Social Security and damage the ability to support our seniors. 
I say right now that nobody wants to damage Social Security. Nobody wants that to happen. Everyone, including me, wants to protect senior citizens. It is absurd to say otherwise. 
Right now Social Security is a partial pay-as-you-go system. The people paying Social Security taxes are paying for the people who are retired today. It is not a fully funded system. It doesn't build up a trust fund. It's a bunch of IOU's. There is no secret vault stacked full of Social Security funds. The revenue from Social Security is invested into Government-backed securities like Treasury bills. To disregard Social Security plays games with the budget. It would require an additional $80 billion match up front. Later, when baby boomers reach retirement, the fund will go broke without an enormous infusion of funds from our children and grandchildren. An amendment is not just for the next 8 years. 
It is for that time when there is an extra burden on Social Security. 
As the only accountant in the U.S. Senate, I believe that in order to ensure stability and longevity of Social Security, we need to go to a modified accrual system of accounting for each of the trust funds. 
We need to talk also about Medicare and the other trust funds, not just Social Security. It happens to be the only one that fits with the argument of the opponents. 
This accrued system would assure that the moneys coming in match up--at some point in the critical near future--to the time that the money has to go out. A modified accrual method would show that any surplus revenue for this year's budget is already committed further down the line. 
I believe we should pass a balanced budget amendment even though the growth rate of the deficit is falling without the amendment. The budget deficit is expected to rise from $107 billion in fiscal year 1996, to $124 billion in fiscal year 1997. This is not a reduction in the size of the deficit. Some are praising the progress in reducing the deficit. We aren't reducing the deficit or the national debt. I don't know where their numbers are coming from. They sure aren't coming from the Congressional Budget Office. But if we move toward a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002, a fiscal dividend of about $34 billion is in sight. 
The Clinton administration and a number of Members of this body 
have already begun a reign of terror on the American people regarding the balanced budget amendment. Members of the administration have criticized the amendment by claiming it is unenforceable. These attacks are not only unfounded, they represent a sad critique on the administration's view of fulfilling its constitutional obligations. 
On January 7, I swore a solemn oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. All of my colleagues in the Senate and the House have taken this same pledge. President Clinton took the same oath on January 20. This is one of the most serious pledges a person can take in his or her lifetime. It binds all Members of the Congress and the President to follow all the provisions in the Constitution. If the balanced budget amendment was added to the Constitution, we would be bound by our most solemn oath to pass a balanced budget in each and every fiscal year. 
For the administration to criticize this amendment as unenforceable is a very serious charge indeed. Does the President intend not to fulfill his constitutional duty to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution by delivering a balanced budget proposal to Congress before each fiscal year? Is the administration insinuating that Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives are willing to blatantly violate the clear language of our Constitution which they took an oath to uphold and defend? 
I do not share the Clinton administration's cynical view that our constitutional officers will openly and flagrantly flout their solemn duties. If we pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment, I have every confidence that Members of this noble Chamber as well as our friends in the House will take their oath to defend the Constitution very seriously. We will balance the budget because we have sworn to uphold the Constitution. We will balance the budget because we desire to leave our children and grandchildren a legacy of hope and prosperity instead of the horror of a $5.3 trillion debt. 
I want to stress that the enforcement of the balanced budget amendment will rest first and foremost with this Congress. Under section 6 of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, Congress must pass implementing legislation to enforce this amendment. This provision indicates that it will be primarily Congress--neither the President nor the Federal courts--which will provide the means of enforcement. Claims that this amendment will result in new powers of Presidential impoundment or judicial involvement in the budgetary process are unfounded. These are nothing more than further attempts by the amendment's detractors to sidestep the serious obligation we all have of safeguarding the financial future of our Nation, and our kids and grandkids. 
I urge my fellow Senators to join me in voting for Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget constitutional amendment. This will be a giant step in restoring responsibility to our Government, and it will demonstrate to future generations that we were willing to act responsibly in the most serious of our tasks. And if we do not balance the budget, we become the longest running game show with the lowest ratings in history. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concerns with the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed changes to air quality standards. The EPA kicked off the last Thanksgiving weekend by announcing its intention to move their air quality goalposts yet again. It seems they change the rules more frequently than the NFL and the NBA put together. I doubt there were many State or local governments that spent Thanksgiving giving thanks for that announcement. I was the mayor of Gillette, a coal producing town on the plains of Wyoming. I know firsthand how hard many of our Nation's cities and States have been working. They have been expending a huge amount of effort and dollars just to get into compliance with the standards established in 1990. 
And let there be no mistake. Compliance, for better or worse, has been costly. It has been costly to small businesses, businesses that operate on thin profit margins in the best of circumstances. It has been costly to major industries that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars retooling their plants and factories to comply with that law. It has been costly to State and local governments that have had to divert scarce dollars to mandated planning and enforcement duties. And most of all, it has been expensive for the citizens who lose jobs when industries relocate overseas or to other areas of the country that are already in compliance. This costly compliance has resulted in the higher taxes levied to compensate for a smaller tax base. And citizens notice higher costs for goods and services. 
I do recognize that the EPA excludes economic concerns from the formulation of their air quality standards. The 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act require that oversight. The air quality standards established in 1990 have been beneficial to our Nation's environment and, by extension, our public health. Of course, the more radical environmentalists point to the absence of an economic apocalypse over the past 7 years as proof that no environmental standard is too strict and nothing is impossible. You and I know that nothing is impossible. But arm in arm with successes has come a dangerous corollary. It is also easy to believe that nothing is too outrageous. 
In the name of species protection, logging in the Pacific Northwest has all but disappeared. Years of careful forest management had rendered these the most productive forest lands in the world. They are so productive that for every 100,000 acres of Pacific Northwest forest land taken out of production, we force a half-million acres of Siberian wilderness to be cut down to fill the void. Environmentalists may have saved a few spotted owls, but in the process they have probably signed the death warrant of the Siberian tiger. It is ridiculous to trade jobs for dubious environmental gain. It is ridiculous to think that we are saving the world by importing our natural resources. This is what Senator Hatfield used to refer to as `environmental imperialism'--imperialism inflicted on nations too desperate to ignore our resource markets yet too poor to enforce their own environmental standards. 
Can the word `ridiculous' apply to the proposed standards themselves? The current standard for particulate matter limits particles to 10 microns or larger. The proposed standard would change that to particles larger than 2.5 microns. For comparison, a human hair is about 28 microns in width. For ozone, the current standard of .12 parts per million averaged over 1 hour would be replaced by a new standard of .08 parts per million averaged over 8 hours. In light of the fact that there are many cities across the Nation that have yet to satisfy the current standard and the fact that no one yet has justified these new standards, I think it is safe to say that the proposed standards fail the credibility test. The Congressional Research Service has stated that `The new standards would substantially increase the number of areas not attaining the Clean Air Act's air quality standards and magnify the difficulties faced by present nonattainment areas in reaching attainment.' And the hardship to be imposed is without reasonable evidence of any additional benefit. 
Billions--billions--of dollars were sent by cities and industry 10 years ago to comply with the current standards. Yet, now the EPA intends to require billions more to comply with the new standards. The capital invested in current compliance has yet to be paid off, in many instances. Areas that are not yet in compliance with the current standards will have to strengthen their restrictions by several orders of magnitude. The possibility of mandatory car pooling and bans on backyard barbecues and lawn mowing are ridiculous, but probably will be the result. 
I can assure you they will not go over well in my State. Wyoming is populated with people gifted with a basic common sense. They are aggressively independent and free thinking. I can only imagine the head scratching that will ensue when they see county tanker trucks watering the dirt roads around there. After all, Wyoming has miles and miles of miles and miles, and many of those roads are gravel. 
Anyone familiar with the average Wyoming winter understands the axiom that sand is safety, yet sand applied to ice-bound roads results in a dust level, and that dust level already violates the proposed standards in many communities. The current clean air standards are already causing wrecks and injury to people. 
From an economic perspective, these standards will visit tremendous hardships upon my State and upon every State that depends on land-use industries. Wyoming is the largest coal producer in the Nation. Clean, low-sulfur coal, I might add. But mining does create some dust. Not really dust, it is smaller than that. That is why we are talking about the size of these particulates. I wish each of you would have an opportunity to visit a mine in Wyoming. Many of you would see a very clean industry. But now the particulates have to be even finer. And oil refining creates gases. 
The Nation simply cannot have job-producing factories or heat in their homes without those byproducts. We are led to believe these standards would eliminate billowing clouds of pollution, but the current laws already do that. These proposed standards would place enormous burdens on our mining and refining industries and would simply spell the end of many western refineries. 
The Environmental Protection Agency and its handmaiden, the environmental movement, are engaging in a form of execution attributed to the ancient Chinese. It is known as death by 10,000 slices, and its current victim is the American economy. Each swipe of the knife results in wounds that are individually minor but cumulatively disastrous. With every burdensome standard, the blade flashes and another small business goes under. With every new expensive regulation, a new slice drips red and another plant or factory moves overseas. With every additional surtax, the knife whistles by, and the American family has less money to place back into the economy. 
Mr. President, we must restore a semblance of balance and reason to our environmental laws. We must introduce cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment into the environmental equation. We must evaluate science above politics. We must honor the work of the last Congress in restricting unfunded Federal mandates. We must stop moving the goalposts on cities, towns, States, and businesses that are already working hard to comply. We must give business and industry incentives to work toward our spiraling environmental goals. It is a small planet. It is where you and I live. We can't keep shifting environmental problems to poorer countries who can't afford the level of clean air we enjoy. We must recognize that the worst thing in the world for the environment is not responsible logging or ranching or mining, but poverty. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important measure. By amending the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, this act would provide employees with flexible work schedules, and increase their choices and options for their time at work and quality time with their families. Ensuring that such opportunities are provided to our workers, better known as mothers and fathers, can only serve to strengthening our American families. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 63 percent of mother and father households now see both parents working outside of the home. Moreover, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children now work. That is why we must take action now to help employees balance the demands of work and family lives. I believe the Family Friendly Workplace Act is an important first step in helping our Nation's working parents do just that. 
In 1993, the President signed the Family and Medical Leave Act into law. While well intended, the Federal Government took a 13-page law and transformed it into 300 pages of regulations. It then became a true administrative nightmare. Instead of targeting employees with choices and options for their work schedules, the President decided instead to target employers with a mandated mound of paperwork. To make matters worse, the President announced during the 1996 campaign his intention to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act by forcing employers to provide school activity and community leave for their employees. Such misguided mandates resurrect the words of Abraham Lincoln who said, `You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer.' As lawmakers, we have the ability to prevent this Nation from traveling further down the road of federally mandated workplace conditions. By passing the Family Friendly Workplace Act, we will avoid the creation of an environment littered with friction and litigation and embrace mutual cooperation and respect. 
Wage payers are not heartless and cruel reincarnations of Ebenezer Scrooge. Having played the wage payer role for over 26 years, I take great offense when employers are characterized as being the bad guys. The majority of employers cherish their most valuable assets--their employees. It is truly misleading and deceptive for anyone to say otherwise. For without the employee, management will ultimately have no staff, no profits--and no business. Watching out for employees is just good business. 
As an alternative to employer mandates, this legislation would provide compensatory time off that would allow employers to offer and employees to choose to use compensatory time for school and family activities and a whole range of other personal reasons--without getting the Government involved in certifying and documenting these events. The President's expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act would require employees to get certification for taking time off to attend a child's soccer match, piano recital, or even a meeting with a school-teacher. Under this bill, employees have the right to choose compensatory time instead of cash wages at a rate not less than 1 1/2 hours of each hour of overtime worked. Employees would be able to accrue up to 240 hours annually and have the opportunity to cash-out their accrued hours at least once a year. That's a lot of time we should be spending with our children--an investment in our future. 
Federal employees have enjoyed flexible work schedules, chock full of choices and options, since 1978. Legislation that amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is long overdue. We appear to have no confidence in private sector employees' ability to make rational decisions on how to spend their time. 
I have been blessed with a wife and three wonderful children. Like many who place value in time shared with family, I believe that such moments are a priceless commodity that can never be replaced--or regained--once lost. At a time when our society clings to every fiber of family life, I can see no better way for Congress and the President to express our support for the American family than by passing and then urging the President to sign into law, S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in giving employees the opportunity to balance their work and family obligations. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I, too, join my new colleagues in cosponsoring this legislation. It is important that we act on this legislation before April 15 to correct a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service regarding the alternative minimum tax. It is a ruling that could dramatically and unfairly increase the tax burden on our farmers who use the cash method of accounting and who utilize installment sales on crops and livestock. 
It is interesting to me that this tax problem is one of the first issues needing legislative correction to present itself to the 105th Congress. It is interesting because the problem arises in the areas of small business and accounting, two areas in which I feel I have some particularly relevant insight. I am a small businessman and an accountant--the only accountant in the Senate, in fact. 
I have wondered for a long time why United States tax policymakers continue to subject small business owners to the onerous burden of calculating both corporate and alternative minimum tax liabilities. The fact is that fewer than 2 percent of the companies filing Federal income tax returns end up paying the alternative minimum tax. Still, all of these companies, many of them small businesses, have to maintain separate sets of records for tax purposes, and that is at a considerable cost. 
In 1993, a Joint Tax Committee analysis confirmed what I as a small business owner and corporate accountant already knew, that compliance with the alternative minimum tax requirements can add 15 to 20 percent to a company's accounting bills at tax time. The effect is that we bury 100 percent of our small businesses in paperwork in order to increase tax revenue for about 2 percent of corporate tax filers. If that is not an unnecessary burden, I do not know what is. 
The legislation that is introduced today will amend the 1986 Tax Reform Act to clarify confusion that was unintentionally created by the revenue act of 1987. I do not blame the IRS for the position it takes in the technical advice memorandum filed in 1995, which states that installment sales of farm property are not exempt from the alternative minimum tax liability in the year that it is expensed. It is the job of the IRS to maximize tax revenue within the confines of the congressionally approved statutes. The question then is, did Congress intend to subject cash receipts on forward commodity sales to a farmer's prior year alternative minimum tax? I do not believe that the 99th Congress intended to do that. For 10 years the IRS has not applied this rule in this way. To do so now is a retroactive tax increase on farmers. We, the 105th Congress, should make the necessary clarifications and pass this bill. 
I believe the bill will pass because reasonable people can recognize simple facts and should agree to correct the problem. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation, but I also hope that it will renew interest in reviewing the issue of alternative minimum tax reform in general. One of the issues I promised my constituents I would pursue if elected to the Senate is simplification of the U.S. Tax Code, and I believe that the phaseout of the alternative minimum tax is a necessary part of that promise. The alternative minimum tax inhibits capital investment, ties up resources and credits, and piles unnecessary compliance costs particularly on small business. It actually produces relatively small amounts of Federal revenue, not all of which would be foregone using regular tax computation. 
The problem this bill would correct typifies the difficulties small business owners in our country have complying with this onerous AMT law. I was pleased that the last Congress was able to achieve consensus on a very good AMT reform bill, a bill that unfortunately became entangled in the highly emotional web of election year politics and subsequently suffered a swift death at the hands of the President. 
I do believe we can and should move toward a more sensible corporate tax system, and I hope the administration is willing to work with us on that.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Madeleine Albright's nomination to take the helm of the U.S. Department of State. I believe she is well qualified and has displayed a unique steadiness and pragmatism during her tenure as our Ambassador to the United Nations. From her difficult beginnings and throughout her life, she has proudly embraced this country. She has served America with dignity and patriotism. In her new position, I hope she will continue to sensibly promote our Nation's best interests. 
All of these qualities are attested to by a very dear friend of mine, Edward Gnehm, our former Ambassador to Kuwait. He now serves as Deputy Assistant Ambassador under Madeleine Albright at the United Nations. I met Skip Gnehm in 1962, when we began 4 good years together at the George Washington University. I have always valued Skip's friendship and his insight--particularly in matters of foreign affairs. 
Skip and I have recently discussed the changing role of the United States in global politics. We agree that, as a nation, we live in a rapidly changing part of the 20th century. World politics is no longer dominated by the tense United States-Soviet detente that defined United States foreign policy for so many years. Gone is our old familiar enemy, the Russian bear, growling on the horizon. But we have also lost the political stability Soviet hegemony provided in the region. No one here would argue for the return of a Communist-controlled Soviet empire, but in the wake of glasnost, we are left with a political minefield that demands careful attention. 
Our foreign relations are more fragile than ever and demand increasing precision. The State Department, our eyes and ears abroad, is our country's first line of defense. Without an effective and supported foreign service, we will have little capability in combating today's imminent threats to American lives. Dangers such as international terrorism and nuclear proliferation among rogue nations truly pose a greater threat to our national security than Russia ever did. 
In light of these facts, I am discouraged by the increasing trend toward isolationism. We cannot turn our eyes inward and ignore the problems of our neighbors. Like it or not, our world is interconnected, interdependent, and international. Today, we send e-mail on the internet across the globe with the push of a button. A phone call can bridge thousands of miles between family and friends. Businesses move money electronically across borders in the blink of an eye. A drought in Kansas can raise the price of bread in Moscow. It is true that domestic peace and prosperity in America are important, but you can't sustain peace and prosperity on an island in a global sea of discord. 
So, I am using this opportunity to speak in support of Madeleine Albright's nomination, but also to voice my concern about the lack of direction and coordination in our foreign policy. We need to identify our goals and be very clear in our message. As the world's only superpower, we cannot stand around watching--simply reacting to random global events. 
I believe Ambassador Albright has demonstrated her exceptional abilities as a diplomat and in offering thoughtful counsel to our President. I would now encourage her to utilize her proven diplomatic skills and her new high-profile job to bring some change in the President's Cabinet room. We need to introduce strategic planning into our foreign policy and she is the person to do it. With well-defined goals, a properly managed administration and a little enthusiasm, our State Department and Foreign Service could again receive the respect they deserve--both at home and abroad.

Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. I specifically chose the balanced budget bmendment as the focus of my first statement in this hallowed Chamber. I chose it because the need for a balanced budget is the most important issue facing all of America today. Without a balanced budget, our children will be saddled with a mountain of debt. Our children and grandchildren will be left with no hope of fulfilling their dreams and aspirations. Our Nation will be weakened and vulnerable. 
I know how to balance a budget. I'm an accountant. I have balanced budgets as a family man, a shoe store owner, a mayor, and a legislator. You and I know how easy it is to spend money. We know it's easier to say `yes' to programs than `no.' There is a constituency for every single program. But I have had to say `no.' We have a duty and a responsibility to our communities, our families and our children to live within our means. Right now we are spending more money than we are taking in. Overspending is a prescription for disaster. Almost any school child understands that if you spend more than your take in--you go broke. 
Because of the Federal Government's ability to print money, we can easily feel there are no spending limits. How can we pay the bills of a nation when we reach the point where interest payments on our debt exceed all the revenue? That scenario is possible. We are now on that course. Without restraint, that could happen even at an impossible 100 percent tax rate on the citizens of this great Nation. Governments go broke when they cannot afford the interest. 
The Federal Government must learn to live within its means. If we were not saddled with such enormous debt, we would have additional revenues to invest in the people and we could reduce the tax burden for every working man and woman in this country. Many States have a constitutional provision to balance the budget. Those States balance their budgets. It is time for us to require ourselves to balance the budget just as they now require the States to do. 
History shows we cannot balance the budget with willpower alone. It is time to look at the hard, cold facts. We now have a $5.2 trillion dollar Federal debt. The deficit looms so large. Many Americans voted for candidates based on their stand on this single issue. A balanced budget amendment was the key to voter confidence. Failure to support this issue will diminish that confidence and could lead to the defeat of other candidates in 2 years. 
The balance budget amendment would help end the frustrating impasse between Congress and the President by requiring that we agree on a budget that is balanced. A constitutional requirement will remove from debate the variable of how long it will take to balance the budget. The argument about whether we should balance it at all will be removed from the discussion. All Americans know that we have to work within the parameters of fiscal sanity. The balanced budget amendment will focus our effort and our attention. 
We have not had a balanced Federal budget since 1969. This fact alone illustrates the difficulty of balancing a budget without an amendment. By failing to balance the budget, we are giving in to the whims of the moment. Without a balanced budget we abandon the ideals of self-control, discipline, and hard work. When we do not balance a budget, we lead by 
the example of selfishness, recklessness and folly. We condone living beyond our means. 
Those opposed to a balanced budget amendment fear it would result in drastic cuts to programs they deem necessary. That is a very shortsighted view of the world. Only by balancing the Federal budget, however, can we guarantee long-term security to any Federal program, including Social Security. By balancing the budget, we do a great service for all Americans. We especially serve those living on fixed income retirement programs. When we pass and the States ratify this amendment, everyone will benefit. Interest rates will decrease. Inflation will be held in check. Business will have true growth. Jobs will increase. 
We need to pass this amendment with no gimmickry, no smoke and no mirrors. Any proposal to exempt Social Security would rule out the possibility of a true balanced budget. Any exemption of Social Security plays games with the future. We need to deal with the facts. Making Social Security exempt from this process would simply allow unlimited spending. An exemption would give the false pretense that we have a balanced budget. 
Getting our entitlement programs in good working order is essential. Finger pointing about who wants to cut entitlements are simply diversions. Sleights of hand over who wants to save entitlement programs are all political ploys. Don't let politics confuse the issue and stall the passage of this amendment. 
The economic future of America's families depends on what we do now. My family is very important to me. I know your families are important to you as well. Every day that passes without a balanced budget hurts. The responsibility of the debt falls on the shoulders of our children and our grandchildren. Will we leave them a legacy of colossal debt totaling more than $5.2 trillion? That incredible debt will burden generations to come. Our kids and grandkids will have an enormous tax burden. They will inherit an economy so weak and a debt so large there will be no hope of them ever paying it off. 
When I was going to grade school, we spent a lot of time on the enormousness of a million dollars. I've always been fascinated with Carl Sagan's emphasis of the difference between a million and a billion. Now we roll a trillion off our tongues with great ease; $5.2 trillion. This is the cruelest of all legacies. 
That debt we are incurring for our kids amounts to taxation without representation. We mounted a revolution over that before. Our Founding Fathers would be embarrassed. We should imitate our forefathers in fulfilling our duty to our children and to our children's children. We must save them from the bondage of insurmountable taxes. If the balanced budget amendment fails, we lose. Future generations lose as well. 
It is time to heed the words of Thomas Jefferson, `I place economy among the first and important virtues, and public debt as the greatest of dangers to be feared.' President Jefferson knew the economic and moral importance of not owing anything to anyone. He also knew that a large public debt could make the United States a slave to other countries and foreign interests. 
Defeat is the real national danger on our horizon. The national security of the United States is threatened by the immense debt. We, as a nation, will be unable to protect ourselves against our enemies, foreign and domestic. And, we will be unable to protect Americans--their jobs and their families. We cannot leave ourselves exposed to economic collapse. A world relies on us to get our economic house in order. If we--you and I--continue the practice of overspending, history will harshly judge us. 
We will say, `We have met the enemy--and it is us.' America has the best form of government on Earth. Now it requires responsibility from its leaders and citizens. The time for leadership is now. The time for the balanced budget amendment is now. 
The American people demand an end to runaway spending. We need to show the American people that we are responsible. This bill will prove restraint by constitutionally limiting the ability to spend taxpayer dollars. Let us not fail them or ourselves. 
We have the longest continuous government on the face of the Earth. This bill is a critical link to the future. We must preserve and protect our Nation and do it for our children and our grandchildren. This is the turning point. What will history say about each of us? 
I urge my colleagues to support the balanced budget amendment.
