Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to the managers of the Interior title of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for including section 139, which ratifies payments made by small refiners under preexisting onshore and offshore royalty-in-kind programs. I was pleased to work with Senators Enzi, Domenici, Thomas, Johnson, and Landrieu on this issue. My office served as the point of contact between the Minerals Management Service and the small refiners in negotiating the final text of this section, which was then included by the managers in the bill, so I would like to make two observations in relation to it. The purpose of this section is to relieve small refiners of potential additional financial obligations that they are not in a position to bear, and to avoid the likelihood that a number of small refiners who participated in a federal program to increase their access to crude oil for refining would be forced into bankruptcy over a question as to whether the amount invoiced by government for that crude oil was correct or not. I do not believe that anything in this section should be construed as expressing congressional intent on any question other than the one of whether small refiners should be relieved of this potential problem. In my opinion, this section does not constitute a congressional view for or against the use of posted prices for the valuation of crude oil produced from federal leases.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Finance for their continuing work on the research and experimentation tax credit, which is extended through June of 1999 by this legislation. In my capacity as ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, I have taken a strong personal interest in the research credit and how it can be made into an effective permanent incentive. It is potentially the most important incentive in our tax code for stimulating long-term economic growth, and I believe that we need to make every effort in the upcoming session of Congress to establish a permanent credit for research and development. 
In the course of these efforts, we need to keep in mind the substantive issues that are intrinsic to the goal, shared by many of my colleagues, of a permanent effective R&D tax policy. Can we make the credit more equitable, to give all R&D-performing firms incentives to increase their R&D? Can it be made more effective for the industries that have historically invested heavily in research and development? Can it be made more accessible by small businesses, which are a growing sector of our nation's R&D and promise to be a leading source of high-wage job growth? And can it further encourage research partnerships--crossing the institutional boundaries of industry, universities, and public-benefit consortia--that lay the groundwork for our future technology and medicine through long-term R&D investments? 
In the negotiations of the past few weeks, Congress came alarmingly close to not extending the credit at all. I am concerned that until we address the substantive issues outlined above, the R&D credit is likely to continue to teeter along in its current state of uncertainty, and that under its current structure it will perform less and less effectively, as an incentive and as an economic stimulus. I am joined in these concerns by economists who have studied the credit and by senior leaders of R&D-intensive corporations. As the distinguished chairman and ranking member know, I and other Senators have introduced legislation to address these issues in this Congress. Obviously, time does not permit us to address these issues at this point, but I would ask them whether they would be willing to have the Committee on Finance consider these issues in the next Congress, in preparation for further legislative action on the credit?

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one of the finest public servants ever to have served the citizens of New Mexico, Mr. Frank Horan. Mr. Horan, who served a quarter of a century as the city attorney of Albuquerque, passed away last Saturday, October 3, 1998. His loss will be deeply felt by countless friends and family---two sons, a daughter, and seven grandchildren---who will always remember his dedication to public service, his deep affection for his community, his abiding love for his family, and his legendary sense of humor. 
Frank Horan was in a sense one of the founding fathers of modern Albuquerque, moving to the city during the early 1940s, and serving as city attorney during the first years of the city's mayor-council form of government. He played a key role in designing the city's governmental structure and establishing its relationship to other jurisdictions within the state. His early professional investment in city government serves as a foundation of today's Albuquerque, a model of good government under the current leadership of Mayor Jim Baca, a longtime schoolmate of Mr. Horan's son, Tom. Tom Horan, following in his father's footsteps, currently practices law in Albuquerque and works with the state legislature. 
Following his years in service to the citizens of Albuquerque, Frank Horan served in the House of Representatives in the State of New Mexico from which he retired in 1982. His dedication to public service, however, did not stop when he retired. In recent years, he devoted his life to volunteer causes, including Meals on Wheels and Encino House, a retirement center located in Albuquerque. Tom Horan reports that his father pursued those activities because, in Frank Horan's words, he was `building his resume.' I am certain that Frank's `resume' will abide favorably in the hereafter. I also know that his spirit and contributions will live on among the citizens of Albuquerque and New Mexico. The people of New Mexico will miss him very much. And so will I. Thank you Mr. President.

 Mr. Bingaman. Mr. President today I introduce with my friend and colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, the Childrens Dental Health Improvement Act of 1998. The bill is designed to increase access to dental services for our disadvantaged children. 
Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment or `EPSDT' program requires states to not only pay for a comprehensive set of child health services, including dental services, but to assure delivery of those services. Unfortunately, low income children do not get the dental service they need. Despite the design of the Medicaid program to reach children and ensure access to routine dental care, the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services reported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid received even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows that no state provides preventive services to more than 50% of eligible children. Dentist participation is too low to assure access. We are falling short of our obligation to these children. 
In the past few months, I have had the opportunity to speak to many of New Mexico's rural health providers and have learned that for New Mexico, the problem is of crisis proportions. Less than 1% of New Mexico's Medicaid dollars are used for children's oral health care needs. My state alone projects a shortage of 157 dentists and 229 dental hygienists. Children in New Mexico and elsewhere are showing up in emergency rooms for treatment of tooth abscesses instead of getting their cavities filled early on or having dental decay prevented in the first place. 
Some will say: `Why care about a few cavities in kids?' In reality, this is a complex children's health issue. Chronically poor oral health is associated with growth and development problems in toddlers and compromises children's nutritional status. These children suffer from pain and cannot play or learn. Their personal suffering is real. In reality, untreated dental problems get progressively worse and ultimately require more expensive interventions. Many of these children come to emergency rooms and ultimately must be treated in the operating room. 
Tooth decay remains the single most common chronic disease of childhood and according to the Children's Dental Health Project, it affects more than half of all children by second grade. Tooth decay in children six year olds is 5 to 8 more common than asthma which is often cited as the most common chronic disease of childhood. 
National data confirm that pediatric oral health in the U.S. is backsliding. Healthy People 2000 goals for dental needs of children will not be met. As this chart shows: 
52% of our 6 to 8 year olds have dental caries, or cavities compared to 54% in 1986. Our goal was to decrease this to 35% by the year 2000; we have only succeeded in a 2% change in this area. 
Additionally, we have slid backwards in some areas. The Healthy People 2000 oral health indicators show an increase in the percentage of children with untreated cavities. In 1986, 28% of our 6 to 8 year olds had untreated cavities compared to now where we find 31% of these children have untreated cavities. 
Tooth decay is increasingly a disease of low and modest income children. A substantial portion of decay in young children goes untreated. In fact, forty seven percent of decay in children aged 2 through 9 is untreated. 
The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act is designed to attack the problem from many fronts. First, our bill addresses the issue of provider shortage by expanding opportunities for training pediatric dental health care providers. Next, we will work toward increasing the actual care provided under the Medicaid program. Additionally, we have looked at the need for pediatric dental research to facilitate better approaches for care. Finally, we have put into place greater measures for surveillance of the problem and have looked at the need to increase accountability in the area of actual treatment once a problem is identified. 
I am committed to solving the problem of adequate access to dental care for our children and view this as a public health issue that has gone unnoticed for too long. I will welcome my colleagues to work with me to ensure that these children have healthy smiles vs. chronic pain from untreated problems.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'd like to join my colleagues in saluting the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senator Strom Thurmond, whose leadership, together with the ranking member, Senator Levin, has produced the fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization bill which is named in the chairman's honor. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your untiring efforts, both for putting together this bill and for your long and distinguished service to our nation. We are a grateful Senate and a grateful nation. 
Achieving this year's defense bill has been no easy task. Every defense budget represents the outcome of an annual debate concerning competing national security priorities. Everyone is familiar with the litany of our defense needs: procurement and modernization, quality of life for defense personnel, operations and maintenance, research and development, training, medical care, and so forth. This year is no different. 
Much has been said about the lack of funding for procurement and modernization of military equipment. Certainly, by historical standards we are far below cold war levels. But our defense needs have changed and will continue to do so. We need to look carefully at the capabilities and quantities of weapons that we will need in the future--particularly in areas where technology could provide lower cost alternatives of getting the job done. 
Nevertheless, in this year's conference report the Congress is taking a step towards meeting those procurement needs. Funding for procurement is up from $49.1 billion requested by the President to $49.9 billion authorized by the conference. 
The conference also took steps to increase funding for quality of life priorities. Funding for military construction and family housing was increased from $7.8 billion to about $8.5 billion. 
But those increases come at a cost. In balancing priorities while remaining within the budget agreement cap, this budget pays the bill by reducing funding in other categories. Funding for research and development, operations and maintenance, and Department of Energy defense activities, for example, were funded at lower levels than requested by the Administration. 
Are those tradeoffs the correct ones from the point of view of our national security? Or are they the outcome of partisan negotiations to meet parochial needs? 
I remain concerned that the teamwork that's needed between the Department of Defense, the Administration, and the Congress to produce a defense budget that meets our real military priorities is flawed. While the Congress took steps to increase procurement funding, many of those purchases do not 
reflect the priorities stated by the military services themselves. The cost of those purchases were bought by cuts to readiness accounts that must now be repaired through an emergency supplemental agreed to by the President. 
Similarly, we risk mortgaging our long term security future by cutting funding for research and development, particularly for basic research. I am pleased, however, that this bill includes a provision that sets successively higher goals for research and development funding during the next decade. I am hopeful that implementation of that provision can enable us to avoid having research and development remain the billpayer for future defense spending increases. 
I applaud this bill for its many specific provisions that serve the simultaneous interests of my New Mexico constituents and the nation's security. 
The bill contains $4.3 billion for weapons activities at the Department of Energy National Labs, approximately half of which will support work being done at Los Alamos and Sandia. 
That work will support the stockpile stewardship program that will enable us to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons stockpile without building new ones and without testing old ones. 
I am hopeful that continued funding for the stockpile stewardship program will enable us to move forward in the Senate with ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next year. 
The bill also includes essential funding for the Cooperative Threat Reduction and the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention programs intended to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and materials through cooperative efforts with Russian nuclear laboratories and scientists. Our laboratories in New Mexico are working closely with their Russian colleagues to benefit the security of both nations against the threat of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists or rogue governments. 
The bill also provides essential funding to remedy the disrepair of the nation's finest weapons testing facility, White Sands Missile Range, in southern New Mexico. Without those funds, we won't be able to assure the technologies and military capabilities to have the effective fighting forces we will need for the nation's future defense. 
The bill also includes key quality of life improvements for our military personnel at Cannon, Kirtland, and Holloman Air Force bases. Units from those bases have served honorably and effectively in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf. The personnel and their families assigned to those bases appreciate the support they are given in this year's defense bill. 
Mr. President, I support this conference report and urge my collegues to vote in favor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, both the House and the Senate are working on what is likely to be a final tax bill for this Congress. As we go about considering tax bills, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will be thinking about the long-term economic effects of the legislation. 
Let me start, of course, by making a distinction that should be obvious to all of us who work around here. That is the distinction between tax bills that are paid for and tax bills that are not paid for and that instead obtain the revenue for the tax cuts from the surplus that we anticipate. 
I agree with the President that if we do a tax bill this year--and I hope we are able to do a tax bill--that we will pay for the tax bill, that we take whatever revenue is required to make those cuts in taxes, and that we will find revenue in the current budget with which to do that. 
I do not think the American people want us to go ahead and begin to spend an anticipated surplus which we have not even realized as yet. Unfortunately, some of the tax proposals--particularly the one passed by the House on Saturday--have that very major defect. 
But let me get back to the primary subject of my comments, which is that if we pass tax legislation we need to be thinking about the long-term economic effects of such legislation. Will such bills enhance our economy by promoting sound investments and sustained future economic growth? Or, instead, will they threaten our projected budget surplus and Social Security without really doing anything for the future economic well-being of the country? 
I raise these questions because there is one crucial element of our Tax Code, more than any other provision in the code, that is directed at our future economic growth. In all the discussions of taxes that have occurred over the past few months, that provision appears to have been given very short shrift. I am referring to the research and experimentation tax credit, commonly called the R&D tax credit, which is slated for yet another minimal, temporary extension, the way tax bills seem to be evolving here today. 
As I am sure most of my colleagues are well aware, investment in research and development is the single largest contributing factor to our past, present and future economic growth. In an economy that is increasingly knowledge-based and increasingly globalized, it is also an important factor in the competitiveness of American industry. Research leads to improved productivity, economic growth, better jobs and new technologies--technologies that have spawned entire new industries and revolutionized the way people do business around the world. But our research tax policy has not been keeping pace with today's economic realities. 
Research investment is of greater and greater importance to American industry. But the on-again-off-again research credit is becoming less and less certain. It was allowed to expire for the ninth time this past June, and is slated for a renewal for less than 2 years. 
Research is being done by large and small businesses in a growing variety of different industries. The way that the credit is currently structured, some companies derive incentive value from it, but others, even though they may be making identical research investments, do not get value. 
Research is also being done increasingly in partnerships. Without partnerships between industry and Federal laboratories, we would never have created the Internet. Without collaborations between independent industry and universities, we would never have biotech. Without alliances among large and small firms, and in broad-based research consortia, we would not be seeing the efficiency gains in our manufacturing base that have been bridging the benefits of technological advances to every corner of our economy. But the research credit, as it is currently structured, does little, if anything, to encourage these partnerships. 
Research is changing. It is important to American business. Its importance to American business is growing. Yet, our policy is stuck in an outdated status quo. 
We have an R&D tax credit that is complicated and difficult for many companies--especially small companies--to use. We have an R&D tax credit that offers almost no incentive--less than three cents per additional dollar of research investment--for many of our, historically, most innovative research-intensive companies. We have an R&D tax credit that does nothing to encourage the interchange of ideas between industry and our great universities, Federal laboratories and other companies. We have an R&D tax credit that cannot even be relied upon as an incentive that will last for more than 1 or 2 years at a time. So the obvious question is: What kind of a commitment is this to America's economic future?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Some of my colleagues will undoubtedly be concerned about the cost of improving and making permanent the R&D tax credit, even though improvements like those in S. 2268 are long overdue. But I think there is an even more important cost to consider. What will it cost us if we don't improve the R&D tax credit? 
Limiting an extension of the R&D tax credit to 20 months, as has been proposed in some of the legislation working its way through Congress, just because of the budgetary scoring consequences, and with full knowledge that we will be back in 20 months with another temporary extension that will also be limited by scoring considerations, is a false economy. The long-term revenue cost to the Treasury of ten one-year extensions of the credit, or five two-year extensions, or one ten-year extension are all the same. We are kidding ourselves if we think we were really saving any money by continuing with these piecemeal, temporary extensions. In fact, this scoring-driven strategy of repeated short-term extensions is worse than a fiscal parlor-trick. It is irresponsible public policy. Why? Because the unpredictable, on-off nature of the short-term extensions keeps America from fully realizing the long-term investments that a R&D tax credit should produce. Thus, we are failing to maximize the public benefits of the tax credit, we are reducing the degree to which it can stimulate research and invigorate our economy, and we are losing future tax revenues that would come from R&D-driven economic growth. 
Our current policy, of piecemeal extension of an archaic, decreasingly effective tax structure, has gone on for 17 years now--a little longer than I have served in the Senate--and I am not the first to propose that we take a better approach. My colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico, has proposed similar improvements to the R&D tax credit. Improving and making permanent the R&D tax credit should be a bipartisan cause. When the Senate considers tax legislation, I look forward to working on this issue with all of my colleagues who care about our economic future, and I urge the members of this body to treat research and development as an urgent priority in our upcoming deliberations.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today marks the two-year anniversary of the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. On September 24, 1996, President Clinton was the first to the sign the CTBT at the United Nations in New York. A total of 150 nations have not signed the treaty, including all five declared nuclear weapons states, and 21 nations have ratified the CTBT. 
This week also marks one year since the President transmitted the CTBT to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. Unfortunately, one year later the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has yet to hold its first hearing on this historic treaty. 
Mr. President, this delay in considering the Treaty not only hinders the Senate from carrying out its constitutional duties; in light of the events in India and Pakistan, it is irresponsible for the Senate to continue to do nothing. It is irresponsible for the security of this nation and the world. 
The Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in May served as a wake up call for the world. We are confronted with the very risk of a nuclear arms race beginning in South Asia. India and Pakistan, as well as their neighbors, have emerged less secure as a result of these tests. I believe that these tests demonstrate the tragic significance of the Senate's failure to take action on the CTBT. We can no longer afford to ignore our responsibility to debate and vote on the treaty. 
Today's press reports that both India and Pakistan have stated their intention to sign the CTBT by September 1999. I want to welcome these announcements by India and Pakistan. The steps are in part the result of an intensive U.S. diplomatic effort, and I congratulate the Administration on this success. India's and Pakistan's commitment to halt nuclear testing is critical to reducing tensions and preventing a nuclear arms race in South Asia. 
The adherence of India and Pakistan to the CTBT will also enhance prospects for the treaty to enter into force sooner. According to its provisions the CTBT will enter into force when 44 countries have nuclear technology have ratified it. With India's and Pakistan's signatures, all 44 of these countries except one, North Korea, will have signed the CTBT. The addition of India and Pakistan as Treaty signatories marks a significant step toward making the CTBT a reality. 
Now more than ever, it is imperative that the Senate begin its consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Senate action on the CTBT would send a clear signal to India and Pakistan that nuclear testing must stop. It would strengthen U.S. diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions between these two countries and persuade them to give up their nuclear ambitions. But signature of the CTBT by India and Pakistan is only the first step in the process of bringing stability to South Asia. Senate action on the CTBT can help build momentum as additional measures are sought for defusing the violative situation. 
Ratification of the CTBT is also critical to U.S. leadership in strengthening the international nonproliferation regime. The risk of nuclear proliferation remains a clear and immediate security threat to the international community as a whole. 
Our efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation have produced significant successes this decade. Several countries, including South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina have abandoned nuclear weapons programs. Under the START Treaty nuclear weapons have been withdrawn from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. 
The United States must continue to lead international efforts to halt and reverse the spread of nuclear weapons. For the United States to be effective in strengthening international nonproliferation measures, we need to demonstrate our own commitment to a universal legal norm against nuclear testing. 
U.S. ratification of the CTBT is in our national security interest. The United States has observed a testing moratorium since 1992. The other declared nuclear weapons states, Britain, France, Russia, and China, have joined us in halting their nuclear testing programs. It is in our interest for these countries to continue to refrain from such testing, which might otherwise contribute to their designing more advanced weapons that are smaller and more threatening. 
The treaty would not prevent the United States from doing anything we otherwise would plan to do, There is no need for renewed U.S. nuclear testing. Nuclear weapons experts from my home State of New Mexico tell me that they have a high level of confidence in the reliability and safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. 
We are committed through the Stockpile Stewardship Program to ensuring the future safety and reliability of our stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. Our strong support for this program in the years ahead is critical for U.S. national security under a comprehensive test-ban regime. 
Mr. President, the American people recognize the grave danger that a new nuclear arms race in South Asia would pose, not only to U.S. national security but also to the security of the international community. They understand that further nuclear testing threatens to undermine international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That's why a recent nationwide poll conducted by the Mellman Group found that 73 percent of the American public believe that the Senate should approve the CTBT, while only 16 percent believe we should disapprove the treaty (11 percent responded `don't know'). This finding of overwhelming support for the treaty occurred after India conducted is nuclear tests. 
Therefore, I urge the Senate to begin debate on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I have sent a letter to the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee requesting that the Committee begin holding hearings on this historic treaty. We need to bring in the experts from the military, intelligence, and scientific communities so we can hear what they have to say. I believe that through such hearings Senators' concerns will be resolved in favor of a CTBT. 
For the sake of our security and that of future generations, we must not let this historic opportunity to achieve a global end to nuclear testing slipaway.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I make this statement today, it is doubtful that many in the press or the public are paying attention to the proceedings of the Senate. While many are watching every nuance and listening to every syllable of the President's videotaped testimony before the still-sitting grand jury, I want to talk about what I believe is a more important issue--the basic fairness of the process of which the videotape is a part. 
Since we Senators may be called on to consider various allegations in judging articles of impeachment, I will not speak here about the substance of what is alleged, or about whether the allegations constitute adequate grounds for impeachment. 
But I believe each of us has an immediate obligation to concern ourselves with the process that is being followed. My purpose today is to call for fairness in that process; fairness in the procedures Congress follows as it prepares to consider these allegations; fairness in the treatment afforded the President. Regardless of what disposition is finally made of the allegations leveled against the President by the Independent Counsel, it is in the interests of everyone--especially future Presidents--that basic fairness be maintained. And to my mind it is impossible to conclude that the process to date has been fair. 
What `unfairness' am I talking about? Frankly, the lack of basic fairness in these proceedings has been so pervasive that it is hard to know where to begin. But here are three significant ways in which the process has lacked basic fairness. 
The first is that the accused has been denied the secrecy of grand jury testimony. Second, the Independent Counsel's report was issued as a sensational narrative, not as a legal document. And third is the rush by both the Independent Counsel and the House to publish and publicize all the material unfavorable to the President before the House has reviewed it and before any determination that impeachment proceedings are warranted. 
First, the actions of the independent counsel have had the effect, and possibly the purpose, of denying this accused, the President, the basic right to secrecy concerning testimony given to a grand jury. 
While the grand jury was considering the matter, the pattern of leaking information about testimony was clear for all to see. Once the testimony was concluded, the Independent Counsel sought and gained authority to deliver to the House of Representatives his report and all materials he chose, regardless of their relevance to particular charges. I firmly believe the Independent Counsel did this with the expectation that the Republican leadership of the Congress would quickly make public any and all material in its possession that portrayed the President unfavorably. 
Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires prosecutors to keep secret the testimony given before grand juries. And with this grand jury, the Independent Counsel assured the President and all witnesses that the testimony they gave was subject to the secrecy requirements under the rule. 
The secrecy requirement recognizes the fact that grand jury proceedings are anything but fair and balanced legal proceedings. Witnesses before a grand jury are not entitled to legal counsel who can object when the rights of the witness are being violated. There is no opportunity for a person who is the target of a grand jury proceeding to cross-examine witnesses against him or to present testimony he considers favorable to his position. 
In the case of this prosecutor and this grand jury, there was no secrecy, at least as to evidence damaging to the President. The substance of every witness's testimony was eagerly made known to the press and, in turn, eagerly reported. 
As if to ensure that the full impact of the accumulated damaging testimony would be felt by the American public before any chance for rebuttal testimony could arise, the Independent Counsel then rushed to obtain court approval and to deliver to the House of Representatives the report and the accompanying documentation which he alone chose to include. The speedy delivery to the House of the report and materials the Independent Counsel selected, freed the grand jury testimony from the limitations of Rule 6(e), and gave the public the full brunt of the prosecution's case without any opportunity for the accused to question the testimony on which it was based.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 introduced by my colleague, Senator Leahy. I urge all my Senate colleagues to support it as well. 
Mr. President, there no doubt are many issues that are on the minds of Americans. Certainly, crime, particularly juvenile crime, delinquency and drug and alcohol abuse, are issues that I hear most about when I am in my home state of New Mexico. Although recent crime statistics shows a clear downward trend in crime on our nation's streets, crime reduction must remain a priority at the federal level. 
This bill comprehensively addresses the problem of juvenile crime, and it strikes a balance between the need to deal with serious juvenile offenders in a swift and meaningful way and the clear, practical necessity to prevent our youth from getting in trouble in the first place. 
I am delighted that the managers of this bill have included two separate bills which I previously introduced, and I thank Senator Leahy for his accommodation. The first, my Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act, deals with the problem of truancy, which long has been neglected as a root cause of juvenile crime. The second, my Safe Schools Security Act of 1998, addresses the problem of school violence and provides resources, such as technical expertise and security technology, to schools that are experiencing the most serious problems in their schools. 
I first want to discuss truancy, which not many people realize is the top-ranking characteristic of criminals. High rates of truancy directly are linked to high daytime crime rates, including violence, burglary and vandalism. As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes place during school hours, and as much as 75 percent of children ages 13 to 16 who are arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants. It is startling to know that some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily student absences are unexcused, and the number of absences in single city can reach 4,000 
Moreover, society pays a very heavy social and economic price due to truancy. Only 34 percent of inmates have completed high school education, and we all are well aware of the staggering costs associated with incarcerating an individual. Sadly, as many as 17 percent of youth under the age of 18 that enter adult prisons have not completed eighth grade, 75 percent have not completed 10th grade. 
Most studies indicate that when parents, schools, law enforcement and community leaders all work together to prevent truancy, to intervene at its early stages, and to create meaningful accountability, we can increase school attendance and reduce daytime crime rates. 
One such program is the Daytime Curfew Program in Roswell, New Mexico, and the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, administered by Judge Glenda Hatchett. Another successful program included in this Act is the Grade Court, which is Farmington, New Mexico, administered by Judge Paul Onuska. All of these programs integrate parental involvement with schools, law enforcement, judiciary, and other community stakeholders in a collaborative effort to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. These are the kinds of programs I believe we should be encouraging, but unfortunately we in the Congress have not yet met the challenge. 
This Act authorizes $25 million per year targeted at building upon integral partnerships between local government, schools, law enforcement, and the courts. Without a doubt, $25 million is a very small price to pay when you consider the dividends we expect when young people stay in school and out of trouble. 
The Youth Law Center, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Network for Youth, which has more than 500 community youth-serving organizations and personnel nationwide all agree with the importance of combating truancy and enthusiastically have voiced their support for this initiative. 
The second provision of this bill I would like to discuss deals with the safety of our public schools. We spend a great deal of time here talking about improving academic achievement of our nation's school children, and I believe we are making great progress. I also believe, however, that we cannot expect a child to perform up to his or her potential in an environment in which they cannot feel safe and secure. Obviously, a learning environment has to be a safe environment. However, recent tragedies in Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, for example, strongly suggest that we can and should do much more to keep our school safe. 
Recently, the Department of Education released the results of a comprehensive study called Violence and Discipline Problems in U.S. Public Schools: 1996-97. The study shows that 10 percent of schools surveyed had at least one serious violent crime during the 1996-97 school year. Also, during the 1996-97 school year, approximately 4,000 incidents of rape or other types of sexual battery were reported in public schools across the country. Additionally, there were approximately 11,000 incidents of physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used and approximately 7,000 robberies in schools that year. 
As grim as the statistics are, we also must recognize the emotional effect that school crime has on our children. According to a separate study, 29 percent of elementary, 34 percent of junior high, and 20 percent of high school students say they are worried about becoming victims of crime at school. Seventy-one percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry they might get shot or stabbed at school. I cannot imagine how a child can be expected to achieve up to his or her potential if they are worried about their physical safety. Clearly, we must respond, and I believe this is an area in which we can make a significant difference, and we should take advantage of the resources we presently have to address this problem. 
Many people are familiar with the fine work of our National Laboratories, which for decades have been leaders in energy and defense research and development. These Labs have many years of experience supporting and helping to protect high-risk facilities and assets for the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and many other federal agencies in some capacity, through the use of security technology. The result of this capability is that our nation's government facilities enjoy some of the finest security and safety programs in the world. This expertise should be fully utilized to improve the safety of our schools. 
Alreacy Sandia Laboratories has taken the initiative. Two years ago Sandia began a pilot project at Belen High School in New Mexico, whereby Sandia security experts implemented a security regimen and installed a variety of security technology. Sandia is 
the first to admit that they do not know the first thing about running a public school, and Belen readily will admit to a lack of expertise in security. Nevertheless, the match was perfect. Working together, Sandia and Belen high school officials changed the school by utilizing a comprehensive security design and technology, including cameras, metal detectors, and sensors. 
The results are very impressive. Since the pilot project was implemented at the school, on-campus violence is down 75 percent, truancy is down 30 percent, theft from vehicles parked in the school parking lot is down 80 percent, vandalism is down 75 percent. These statistics are compelling, and with this level of success already demonstrated, the effort should be expanded to allow more schools to access the expertise and technology. 
This technology is not cheap, and schools already are challenged to purchase basic educational materials and equipment. However, I believe that with the right technical assistance and technology, not only will this help schools become safe for the children, but schools will save money. Incredibly, the Belen school principal, Ron Marquez, reported to me that before the pilot went into effect, Belen high school had approximately $50,000 per year in losses due to stolen school property. One year after the pilot, Belen has had only $5,000 in insurance claims. The savings translates into, for example, less cost to repair vandalized property, or property that has been defaced by graffiti. 
We must take advantage of this success and put this expertise to use where it certainly will have very positive results. 
One other provision in this bill that I believe will make a tremendous difference to communities that are struggling to reduce juvenile crime is the provision that allows communities to replicate proven juvenile crime reduction strategies. Specifically, this bill provides resources to communities that collaborate with local, state, and federal agencies to address the juvenile crime problem. In my state of New Mexico, we are helping bring together community leaders, schools, judges, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and grass-roots community organizations in order to develop and implement the Boston Strategy to Reduce Juvenile Violence. As anyone would agree, when community leaders work and communicate with one another on a common problem, usually good things. The City of Boston has had great success in reducing its violent crime rate. For example, after being at or near the top of the list among cities in terms of homicide, Boston's juvenile homicide rate dropped to zero, and its overall homicide rate dropped by sixty percent between 1995 and 1997. 
There is clear value to helping communities do the same kinds of things, and this bill helps in a substantial way. 
I thank Senator Leahy for his hard work to craft this important legislation and Senator Daschle for his leadership, and I am very pleased to support it.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this debate about the campaign finance bill is really about a single question, and that is what should determine the outcome of our Federal elections? Should money determine the outcome of our Federal elections or should instead we have those elections determined by a balanced discussion, a complete and a balanced discussion about the differences between the candidates and the different positions they are taking? Should it be money or should it be helpful information for voters? Should it be money or should it be a robust debate on issues? 
The question that I just posed has been obscured because opponents of campaign finance reform are hiding behind what I believe are mistaken Supreme Court decisions, and in doing so they have tried to equate money and speech. They argue that money is speech, and therefore to limit money is to limit speech. They say that money means more robust debate. They say that more money means more helpful information for voters. They say that even more money means more complete and balanced discussion about the differences between the candidates. 
In my view, this argument does not pass the laugh test. Any reasoned observer of our Federal campaigns knows that the argument is without merit. Ask any challenger to an incumbent Senator the following question: Have not the millions more in dollars that the incumbent has been spending on his or her reelection meant more robust debate? Have not the millions of dollars that the incumbent has been spending meant more helpful information to the voters and more complete and balanced discussion about the differences between the candidates? The challenger, I am sure, would laugh out loud at that notion. 
Ask any voter who has been deluged with negative television advertisements funded by very large campaign war chests whether those TV ads have produced more robust debate and more helpful information for the voters and more complete and balanced discussion of the differences between the candidates. Again, those voters will think that you are crazy to even suggest that idea. The vast increase in money spent on political campaigns has not produced more robust debate. It has not produced more helpful information for voters and more complete and balanced discussion about the differences between candidates. 
More money has produced just exactly the opposite. Voters themselves will tell you that money does not equal speech. In fact, they will tell you that money is not speech and that money too often results in an undermining of our ability to meaningfully discuss issues in a campaign. They are very specific about this. Voters were surveyed by Princeton Survey Associates recently and those voters said that campaign money leads elected officials to spend too much time fundraising--63 percent of the public believes that; that money not speech determines the outcome of elections under the current system--52 percent of voters believe that. 
Even more importantly, voters believe that campaign money gives one group more influence by keeping other groups from having their say in policy outcomes. They believe that campaign money keeps important legislation from being passed. They think campaign money leads elected officials to support policies that even those elected officials do not think are in the best interests of the country. And finally, the public believes that campaign money leads elected officials to vote against the interests of their own constituents, the people who have sent them to Congress to represent them. 
Let me add parenthetically that in this very Senate session the killing of the tobacco bill in June, Congress' refusal now to even consider serious HMO reform in the Senate, these are recent vindications of the people's beliefs about the effects of money on our policymaking efforts. 
So the argument by opponents of campaign finance reform that money is speech and that it should in no way be limited simply does not pass the laugh test with the American people. 
People are right that we desperately need to reform our campaign finance system. We need to reduce the amount of money raised and spent in our campaigns. We need to increase the amount of robust debate and helpful information that we provide to voters. We need to increase the discussion, the complete discussion about differences between candidates on issues of importance to the people. 
The modified McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill offered to the Senate today is a big step in that direction. It does at least two very important things. First, it will reduce the amount of big, unregulated donations from corporations and unions and wealthy individuals in our campaigns. Second, it will regulate the huge amounts of money spent by so-called `independent' special interest groups on advertising, which is disguised as `issue ads' but in fact is designed to advocate the defeat of a particular candidate. 
The original McCain-Feingold bill did even more, but the bill had to be scaled back to reduce the objections from some of the opponents to campaign finance reform. I stand ready to support the motion to allow a vote on the modified version of McCain-Feingold. I hope today that minority of Senators who have repeatedly denied the people an up-or-down vote on this bill will change their minds. I hope that with the historic passage of the bill by the House--representing a majority of the voters of the United States--this minority of Senators will see that they should not again thwart the clearly expressed will of the people. 
I hope this minority of Senators will not want to be the single force responsible for continuing the undermining of our national political system that is accomplished each day by the millions and millions of dollars of unregulated campaign money when today they have a unique and historic opportunity to change all of that. 
So, I hope those who have, in recent months, opposed the will of the people on this vote, on this issue, will vote for cloture, will give the people the up-or-down vote they very much want and very much deserve.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as most of know, Angela Raish retired at the end of July from her position as Personal Secretary to our colleague, Senator Pete Domenici. This is an event viewed with mixed emotions by all of us New Mexicans who have had the pleasure of working with Angela over the years. On the one hand, we are glad that she and her husband Bob are taking some much-deserved time for themselves. On the other hand, and there's always another hand, all of us who have come to know and admire her will miss our day to day dealings with her. 
Twenty-one years of service to one Senator, one Senate office and one state--our own New Mexico--represent a remarkable career of attention and devotion. Ever gracious and thoughtful, she has been a wonderful friend to my staff and me. I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of Senate Resolution 272 which Senator Domenici introduced on Tuesday of this week. It expresses what we all feel for this lovely person and the work she has done for the Senate. We are fortunate to know her.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding me time. I want to join my colleagues in resisting S. 1873, this proposal. In my view, what this proposal would do is to put our Defense Department in an untenable position. It essentially says that, in this case, in the case of national missile defense, as distinguished from all other cases, they should ignore the criteria that they use for deciding which programs to go ahead and deploy. Those criteria are that they maintain a sensible balance among cost, schedule, and performance considerations, given affordability constraints. 
Now, that is the criteria the Department of Defense has set up. This proposal by my colleague from Mississippi would have them ignore those provisions and rush ahead to develop this as soon as it is technologically feasible. We have some experience with efforts by Congress to turn up the political pressure on the Department of Defense and to urge them to rush ahead with development of programs before they can be safely deployed. The most recent example is one that many of us are familiar with; it is the THAAD Program, Theater High Altitude Area Defense Program. In that case, again, we were anxious to get this program fielded. The Congress put increased pressure on the Department of Defense to move ahead. Accordingly, we have had disaster. In that case, the program is 4 years behind schedule. There have been five consecutive flight test failures of the THAAD interceptor. The cost of the program has risen from $10 billion to $14 billion today. 
General Larry Welch, who reviewed this missile defense program and other programs indicated that one reason is that there was a very high level of risk, that we were, in fact, engaged in what he called a `rush to failure' in the THAAD Program. We do not need a rush to failure in the national missile defense program to follow onto the rush to failure in the THAAD Program. We need a program that the Department of Defense can develop on an urgent basis, but on a reasonable basis. I believe they are on that course. I believe when General Shelton asks us to refrain from this kind of a legislative proposal, I think we should take his advice. I hope we will defeat the proposal by the Senator from Mississippi.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Treasury appropriations subcommittee for accepting the amendment which includes $1,500,000 additional funding for the Southwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area to combat the methamphetamine problem. I know the Senators are aware of the growing national problem of methamphetamines. New Mexico is no exception and has been experiencing a growing problem with methamphetamine production, transshipment, and cleanup of seized methamphetamine labs. It is fast becoming the drug of choice because it is easy to manufacture, it is highly addictive, and it is cheap to buy on the street. The costs associated with combating the methamphetamine problem is straining New Mexico's ability to combat other illegal drugs. New Mexico's proximity to the US/Mexico border exasperates the problem because of increased international travel.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a provision in the FY 1999 Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriation bill regarding military assistance for the Baltic nations that, according to the Committee report, is intended to accelerate the integration of the Baltic States into NATO. Although the Administration has assured the Congress that consideration of the Baltic nations for membership in NATO would proceed in a deliberate fashion in consultation with our NATO allies subject to the procedures already established, designating military assistance to the Baltic nations in accordance with the language contained in the Committee report would circumvent those assurances. I wish to advise my colleagues that the allocation of any military assistance provided in this bill to the Baltic nations will not assure their admission into NATO. 
Mr. President, I recall that during the recent debate on enlarging NATO last April, many senators expressed their concern about extending our military commitments beyond the limits which are already straining our ability to meet worldwide contingencies. I believe that providing military assistance to the Baltic nations in order to accelerate their membership into NATO could lead us into a de facto security commitment to that region that might strain our resources even further, and therefore, be harmful to our national security interests as well as those of our NATO allies. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate as well as the distinguished Dr. Henry Kissinger who testified last spring before the Armed Services Committee question our ability to respond effectively to military contingencies in the Baltic region. 
In addition, Mr. President, I am very concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Russia at this vulnerable time in international relations. Providing military assistance to the Baltic nations for the express reason of accelerating their membership in NATO is likely to exacerbate the uneasy state of our relations with the current Russian government as well as many influential Russian leaders who oppose that nation's current leadership. I do not believe it is in our interest to create unnecessarily greater difficulties with Russia than we already have. I believe this provision of the bill as discussed in the Committee report could cause significant problems with Russia and unfounded expectations among the Baltic nations for whom there is no assured membership in NATO. 
I have spoken with Senators Leahy, Hutchison, and Roberts about my concerns and they share these sentiments.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in enthusiastic support of the statement made by Senator Roth concerning the U.S.-Japan relationship and, furthermore, to ask our colleagues to support this resolution. 
As you are aware, I have been integrally involved over the years with many of my colleagues in ascertaining the obstacles and opportunities that exist between the United States and Japan. I have offered ongoing support for a cooperative, forward-looking bilateral relationship that is defined by transparency, access, equity and reciprocity. Given the current environment in East Asia and the potential for political economic instability, I believe the U.S.-Japan relationship to be one of our country's most important in that region, and worthy of constant and precise attention. 
In the future, much as in the past, Japan will be both partner and competitor, and we must ensure that we maintain our support for this relationship while we recognize both its possibilities and its limitations. 
The resolution submitted by Senator Roth and I identifies the level of science and technology interaction that has developed between the United States and Japan over the last decade, and gives a number of suggestions as to where we should go in the future. Specific reference is made to the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement, which is now being re-negotiated by our two governments. Let me describe in concise terms what I see as important in this regard. 
Significantly, the United States and Japan are, at present, cooperating in a range of projects as diverse as Global Change, Earthquake Disaster Mitigation, Emerging Infectious Diseases, Global Information Infrastructure, Space Cooperation, Thermonuclear Experimentation, Deep Sea Drilling, and Sustainable Development. Individually, these projects include the participation of nearly every department and agency in the U.S. government, and all have been initiated and have prospered as a result of the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement. All of these projects will grow even more substantially with the renewal of the agreement. Clearly this is something to be encouraged. 
Significantly, all of these projects mentioned above will benefit not only the United States and Japan, but also the developed and developing countries in the world--many of which are eager for the knowledge and technology that derive from our two countries' cooperative activities. This interaction has already provided innumerable advantages to the international community, and can only provide even more in the future. With certain conditions, it deserves our wholehearted support. 
The current resolution outlines some, but not all of these conditions. As specific examples, we need to ensure that the cooperative interaction between the United States and Japan results in balanced and easily accessible flows of information between the United States and Japan, and that all data from this interaction be easily available to other scientists and engineers in the international community. International access to private sector laboratories in Japan needs to be improved. Divisions that exist between ministries in Japan--fragmentation that creates serious obstacles for research projects that include national universities and government research laboratories--must be made less evident. Effective mechanisms that allow the U.S. and other countries to participate in Japanese research projects need to be identified and obstacles that preclude this interaction eliminated. A more complete development of common regulations and standards should be pursued, and dual use and export control policies clarified. Questions relating to intellectual property rights have existed far too long and should be rectified. Finally, the obvious relationship that exists between science, technology and trade relations should be recognized, and understandings reached between the two governments on important, cross-cutting issues. 
While these aforementioned problems should not prevent the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement from being renewed, our concerns should be made apparent during negotiations. 
I would argue that any new agreement must satisfy three criteria: 
First, it must recognize that serious structural and procedural 
assymetries still exist between the two countries and that they must be resolved; 
Second, it must provide freedom for scientists and engineers to interact and complete their research as free as possible from government interference; 
Finally, it must recognize that the results that derive from U.S.-Japan science and technology cooperation has the potential to alleviate many of the problems we face in the world today and, as such, should be easily diffused into the international community. 
Much of our current science and technology cooperation with Japan rests on a single but extremely important premise: the U.S. economic and national security interest depends upon its ability to complete fundamental research in critical areas, and then encourage innovation that will result in competitive advantage. Where this research might once have been done in isolation and without data input from other countries, it now requires the capacity to access information and technologies being developed elsewhere. While the United States has been inattentive to the importance of increased expenditures on science and technology, Japan has not. While we still lead in many technologies, we will not do so in perpetuity. 
Science and engineering are the archetypical endeavors of the current international society: individuals and ideas come together in an effort to improve the collective welfare of the global community at large. We must recognize this dynamic, and encourage it every way we can. 
Let me emphasize that the results of research in laboratories across the world are not abstractions. As America's productivity, competitiveness, and economic performance--indeed, its very economic security--depends upon cooperative research and development with Japan and other countries, these results provide tangible advantages for families in New Mexico and every other state in the union. The car you drive, the home you live in, the appliances you use, the food you eat, the air you breathe--all of these derive from research and development programs that were undertaken yesterday. These programs should be a national priority. 
To this end, it is essential that we further solidify the cooperative linkages that exist between our two countries, to find ways to leverage increasingly scarce funds, to combine diverse and complementary streams of ideas and technologies, and to provide mutual advantages to our respective societies and the international community as a whole. 
Although some would deny the obvious synergies that exist between the United States and Japan at this time, it is not in our national interest to do so. The question is no longer whether these synergies will exist, but under what conditions they will exist. Interaction between our two countries exists on a scale far beyond what many once considered possible, and it will only grow as scientific and technological interaction between the two countries increases. We should take real pride in this development, just as we must, at the same time, carefully consider the path we will follow in the future. 
While the current resolution is non-binding, it does reflect our desire to engage Japan in an ongoing, cooperative, and reciprocal relationship. Senator Roth and I consider the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement to be an interactive arrangements of the highest importance, and we hope other colleagues will join us in our support for its renewal.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk about a critical energy issue facing the country today that calls for urgent action. 
That is the price collapse that we have seen for crude oil. We are near historically low prices for crude oil in the world, in real terms, due in part to the economic turmoil in Asia. This is leading to several serious problems. 
First, we are threatened with the loss of a major domestic industry. When the wellhead price of crude oil is in the vicinity of $10 a barrel, as it has been recently in the Permian basin and elsewhere in the country), we drive producers of oil from marginal wells out of the business. There are about a half million marginal wells in this country. The employment from operating those wells puts food on the table for a lot of families all over the country, and we need to be concerned about their economic future. 
Second, low prices mean we lose royalty and tax revenues that fund public education. Since October 1997, the drop in crude oil prices has triggered a revenue shortfall in the States totaling $819 million. That's close to a billion dollar loss for public education in less than one year. In New Mexico, counties and towns are canceling planned school construction and renovation projects. 
Third, our national energy security is threatened. During the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, we imported 30 percent of our oil. Today, it's 56 percent. Even before the current price decline, the Energy Information Administration was predicting that imports would go to 68 percent by 2015. With lower prices, though, EIA's projection rises to 75 percent oil import dependence. 
Finally, international stability is put at risk by current oil prices. Earlier this month, the IMF approved $11.2 billion in aid for Russia. $2.9 billion of that amount was to make up for shortfalls in Russia's export earnings. Over half of Russia's oil is exported, but the benchmark price for that oil has declined by 25 percent in this year alone. Continued low world oil prices could undo whatever gains in stability are accomplished in Russia by IMF funding. The same is true of other major oil-producing countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. 
The Senate has recently focused on the problems confronting farmers growing out of collapsing world commodity prices. When it considered the agriculture appropriations bill, the Senate agreed to help address this urgent farm crisis by providing the Secretary of Agriculture with $500 million, under an emergency appropriation, to help agricultural producers, including family farmers, to stay in business. We need to do the same thing for the domestic oil industry. 
The amendment that I have sent to the desk does just that. It is an emergency appropriation to allow the Administration to buy back all the oil the government has sold out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for budgetary purposes since the Gulf War. That amount comes to 28 million barrels. 
We sold this oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay for other unrelated spending on appropriations bills. In effect, we were using one of the country's prime energy security tools as a giant ATM machine. The Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee and I led an effort last year and this to put a stop to such sales. 
I am gratified that the Committee on Appropriations is not proposing any further sales this year. But the energy security concerns that I have mentioned, particularly our continuing and growing reliance on foreign oil imports, make repurchase of the oil for the SPR a good idea. Also, at current world oil prices, the oil we put back will cost less than what we sold it for. At an estimated cost of $15 per barrel delivered to the SPR, this amendment would require a $420 million emergency appropriation. 
The use of an emergency appropriation in this case is well justified. It is somewhat less than what the Senate has done for farmers who are facing similar financial losses from the same sort of world economic forces and collapsing prices. And there can be no doubt that the economic implosion that threatens the oil-producing regions of the Southwest, if we allow current trends to continue, qualifies as an emergency. 
This amendment gives the kind of help that does the most good here in the United States and internationally. It gets excess oil off the market. This would have a significant beneficial impact on wellhead prices, but not enough to trigger a price spike for refined oil products. 
I think this is a good amendment. I think it is consistent with our concern for our long-term energy security. I think it is a very good investment. This is the time when we should, as a country, be thinking about replenishing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I hope very much the managers of the bill will be able to accept this amendment and that we will be able to add it to this piece of legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1998. In doing so, I would like to discuss the importance of this measure and how I believe the issue of truancy, as it relates to juvenile crime, has long been neglected. 
More people are realizing that truancy often is the first sign of trouble in the life of a young person. It is the first indication that a young person may be on a sad track to a life of crime, drugs, and other serious problems. 
Of course, in most every case, it is an early indication that a young person has no interest in school and inevitably will drop out. This is especially sad because many truants and eventual drop-outs are two and a half times more likely than high school graduates to be on welfare and twice as likely to be unemployed or to be paid at the lower end of the wage scale. 
Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of criminals--more common than such factors as coming from a single-parent family and being abused as a child. High rates of truancy directly are linked to high daytime crime rates, including violence, burglary and vandalism. As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes place during school hours, and as much as 75 percent of children ages 13 to 16 who are arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants. It is startling to know that some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily student absences are unexcused, and the total number of absences in a single city can reach 4,000. 
Moreover, society pays a very heavy social and economic price due to truancy. Only 34 percent of inmates have completed high school education, and we all are well aware of the staggering costs associated 
with incarcerating an individual. Sadly, as many as 17 percent of youth under the age of 18 that enter adult prisons have not completed eighth grade, 75 percent have not completed 10th grade. 
Put in graphic economic terms, it is estimated that truants and high school drop outs cost the nation $240 billion in lost earnings and foregoing taxes over their lifetimes, and the cost of associated crime control is staggering and perhaps immeasurable. 
In most cases the parents may not be aware their child is truant, and we have to do a better job of notifying them when a child is not in school. Most studies indicate that when parents, schools, law enforcement and community leaders all work together to prevent truancy, to intervene at its early stages, and to create meaningful accountability, we can increase school attendance and reduce daytime crime rates. 
Because truancy is usually an indicator of later delinquency and criminal behavior, we have one of the best opportunities to identify the kids that are on track to later problems and to intervene before the problems get too serious. The unfortunate truth, however, is that is addressing juvenile crime, we have not focused enough attention on this specific issue, and although prevention programs can work, there is a lack of targeted federal funding for effective truancy prevention. 
The Departments of Justice and Education both have recognized truancy prevention as a key reducing juvenile crime. The Departments jointly have issued a series of reports called `Youth out of the Education Mainstream,' that shine a positive spotlight on various proven comprehensive, collaborative truancy models from around the country. 
Once such program is the Daytime Curfew Program in Roswell, New Mexico, and the Truancy Intervention Project in Fulton County, Georgia, administered by Judge Glenda Hatchett. Another successful program included in this Act is the Grade Court, which is Farmington, New Mexico, administered by Judge Paul Onuska. All of these programs integrate parental involvements with schools, law enforcement, judiciary, and other community stakeholders in a collaborative effort to reduce truancy and juvenile crime. 
This Act authorizes $25 million per year targeted at building upon integral partnerships between local 
government, schools, law enforcement, and the courts. Without a doubt, $25 million is a very small price to pay when you consider the dividends we expect when young people stay in school and out of trouble. 
In general, this Act provides incentives for partnerships between schools and local government, including local law enforcement to build parental involvement in situations where they may be useful and parental responsibility when necessary. The Act also provides incentives for these partnerships to develop meaningful penalties for young people and even their parents when truancy has become a chronic problem, and to allow schools the means to develop in-school alternatives to suspension and expulsion for chronic truants. This Act also will give schools the resources to acquire the technological tools to notify parents automatically in the event of an unexcused absence. 
The Act is endorsed by the Youth Law Center, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Network for Youth, which has more than 500 community youth-serving organizations and personnel nationwide all committed to helping keep our young people on track and keeping our communities peaceful. I thank these organizations for their assistance and know this Act will be enthusiastically received by many more important organizations. I urge my Senate colleagues to support the bill for passage this year.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just state my understanding of this. When I was in private practice--and I don't pretend to know the details of all the circumstances the Senator from Oklahoma is talking about, but when I was court appointed to handle a case, I was expected, through that hourly fee that was granted to me, to cover all of my costs, which meant the costs of my office, costs of my assistants, the costs of everything. 
Frankly, the hourly fee I got for court-appointed work was substantially less than the hourly fee I got for any other work. And I assume that is still the case. So I think to make the comparison he is making and say the U.S. attorney gets $118,000 and the court-appointed attorney gets $125 per hour, and that we should try to make a comparison there, I think it is really very much apples to tangerines because, in fact, the U.S. attorney has a tremendous office arrangement, with support of all kinds, in addition to his salary, whereas the court-appointed attorney gets none of that.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me just clarify. When you are talking about the take-home pay for the court-appointed counsel, you are talking about the amount of funds they take with which to pay for their law firm's ability to participate in the case. I think that is clearly a figure that bears very little resemblance to what the U.S. attorney gets in salary and the paycheck that he takes home at the end of each month. I think you are trying to put an artificial limit on what the court-appointed counsel can get, which I think is a real disservice to the criminal justice system. If we are going to continue with the notion that we are going to have court-appointed counsel for people who are accused of crimes and who can't afford their own counsel, we have to have some reasonable way of compensating them and not expect that court-appointed counsel to work for nothing half of the time, or more, during each month. 
Mr. President, based on my understanding of the amendment, I oppose the amendment. I understand that Senator Leahy is opposed to the amendment, but he is not able to be here right now to make a statement. I think this will artificially limit the amount of work that court-appointed counsel are able to do on behalf of criminal defendants. To that extent, I think it subverts the criminal justice system. I oppose it.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment is a simple amendment to correct a longstanding error in what is known as the Lanham Act, the statute that controls what can and what cannot be trademarked. 
In doing so, let me indicate my appreciation to Senator Leahy and Senator Inouye for their support and, of course, my colleague Senator Domenici. 
Mr. President, the Lanham Act of 1946, the primary statute governing what can and cannot be trademarked, protects flags, coats of arms, and official insignia of the United States, States, municipalities, and foreign nations. 
It essentially says those cannot be trademarked. However, the act neglects to protect the insignias which belong to American Indian tribes. I believe strongly that this was an oversight. It is time we corrected the oversight. 
Significantly, I want to be clear that in offering this amendment, I do not intend to affect existing trademark rights that may already have been conferred under this act. This amendment also does not have any affect on any current existing, non-trademarked usage of these tribal insignia but only sets out to prohibit the trademarking of tribal insignia in the same way a State's, municipality's, foreign nation's, and the United States' insignia currently is protected. 
A key point that must be made here is that tribal governments are recognized as forms of government listed under the Act and should be treated in the same way that State, municipal, county, and of course the United States governments are considered. The Lanham Act originally was passed in 1946, and at that time, there was not as much recognition of the governmental status that federally-recognized Indian tribes hold. Today, however, we understand more than ever that tribal governments are sovereign and should be respected as such. Thus, it is an appropriate time to include federally recognized tribes for protection under the Lanham Act. 
Significantly, tribal insignia often are considered sacred by a respective Indian tribe, and for that reason they should be prohibited from trademark. The Lanham Act protects from trademark anything that would disparage a belief. For example, if someone wanted to trademark a crucifix, Star of David, or Madonna and Child, in such a way that would disparage any one of those significant symbols, the trademark office is directed by law to deny that application for trademark. 
However, there are is no similar protections for the many symbols that American Indian people hold very sacred. For example, the Zia pueblo, which is located in New Mexico, holds very sacred a symbol they refer to as the `sun symbol.' This symbol is probably familiar to many people because it appears on the flag of the State of New Mexico. It is a very popular symbol among businesses and artisans. The Pueblo of Zia generally does not take particular issue with the use of the symbol unless there is an attempt to have the symbol trademarked, the use of which would disparage their religious beliefs. 
Clearly they have a real interest in seeing that someone else does not come along and trademark the insignia that the tribe has always claimed as its own. 
Unless you are a tribal member, you could not appreciate the significance of the symbol. In fact, Zia Pueblo holds the symbol so sacred that it would be against their religious beliefs to disclose to anyone outside of the tribe how they use the symbol in their sacred rituals. 
Indeed, applications have been submitted to the Office of Patent and Trademarks, and each time an application is submitted, the Pueblo must contest the application. 
This involves substantial legal costs to the Pueblo, and the Pueblo Tribe is not in a financial circumstance where it can take on those legal costs in an indefinite future. 
The Pueblo is located in a very isolated, desolate area of the state and has very high unemployment. I admire the Pueblo because they hold fast the centuries-old traditions and beliefs in spite of that great economic hardship. They are a non-gaming tribe and have few resources for water treatment facilities, schools or other vital services. Nonetheless, they are willing to contest the trademarking of a symbol that they hold very sacred. The problem is pervasive among all twenty-two tribes in New Mexico and among all American Indian tribes nationwide. 
Yet we have a statute in place that protects every form of government, even foreign nations, but it does not protect American Indian governments. 
By simply inserting `federally recognized Indian tribes' in a list that already includes `United States,' `States,' `municipality,' and `foreign nation,' my amendment finally will offer protection from trademark to tribes the same protection that already is conferred upon any other form of government. My amendment does not affect any existing trademark rights that may already have been conferred under the Lanham Act. 
What we are saying here is that we should take the Lanham Act where it provides for exceptions and says that you cannot trademark the insignia of the United States, States, municipalities, and foreign nations. We are saying we should assert federally recognized Indian tribes as another one of the categories that enjoys this same protection. 
To me, it is a very straightforward amendment. I see no real basis for anyone opposing the amendment. I hope that it will be agreed to. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding a bill I am introducing today, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act. 
Mr. President, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act or RECA was originally enacted as a means of compensating thousands of individuals who suffered from exposure to radiation as a result of the federal government's nuclear testing program and federal uranium mining activities. While the government can never fully compensate for the loss of a life or the reduction in the quality of life, RECA serves as a cornerstone for the national apology Congress extended in 1990 to the victims of the radiation tragedies. In keeping with the spirit of that apology, the legislation I introduce today will further correct existing injustices and provide compensation for those whose lives and health were sacrificed as part of our nation's effort to win the Cold War. 
In 1990, I was pleased to have been a sponsor of the RECA legislation here in the Senate. I was very optimistic that after years of waiting, some degree of redress would be given to the thousands of miners in my state of New Mexico. I chaired the Senate oversight hearing on this issue in Shiprock, N.M. for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1993 and began to hear of changes that were necessary. To that end, I worked to facilitate changes in the regulatory and administrative areas. 
Unfortunately, I have heard from many of my constituents that the program still does not work as intended. I have received compelling letters of need from constituents telling me how RECA needs to be amended. The letters come from widows unable to access the current compensation. Miners and millers tied to oxygen tanks, in respiratory distress or dying from cancer write to tell me how they have been denied compensation under the current act. Family members write of the pain of fathers who worked in the mills. They recount how their fathers came home covered in the `yellow cake' of uranium oxide that was floating in the air of the mills. The story of their father's cancers and painful breathing are vivid in these letters and yet the current act does not address their needs. 
Mr. President, the bill I introduce today will address the issues they raise in their sometimes angry and often tear stained letters. Their points are backed by others as well. In fact, the bill incorporates findings by the prestigious Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) which has, since 1990, enlarged scientific evidence about radiogenic cancers and the health effects of radiation exposures. In other words, because of their good work, we 
know more now than we did in 1990 and we need to make sure the compensation we provide keeps pace with our medical knowledge. 
Other amendments will, in essence, adopt and incorporate into RECA the recommendations made in October 1995 by the President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments. This blue-ribbon committee determined that U.S. uranium miners were used as subjects of an experiment which had tragic results. It used this language to condemn the ethical outcome of this study:  
The grave injustice that the government did to the uranium miners, by failing to take action to control the hazard and by failing to warn the miners of the hazard, should not be compounded by unreasonable barriers to receiving the compensation the miners deserve for the wrongs and harms inflicted upon them as they served their country. 
Mr. President, I would like to cite several of the key provisions in the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act. Currently RECA covers those exposed to radiation released in underground uranium mines that were providing uranium for the primary use and benefit of the nuclear weapons program of the U.S. government. The bill would make all uranium workers eligible for compensation including above ground miners, millers, and transport workers. 
RECA currently covers individual termed `downwinders' who were in the areas of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona affected by atmospheric nuclear testing in the 1950's. This bill expands the geographical area eligible for compensation to include the Navajo Reservation. In addition, the bill expands the compensable diseases for the downwind population by adding salivary gland, urinary bladder, brain, colon, and ovarian cancers. 
Currently, the law has disproportionately high levels of radiation exposure requirements for miners to qualify for compensation as compared to the `downwinders.' My legislation would set a standard of proof for uranium workers that is more realistic given the availability of mining and mill data. The bill also removes the provision that only permits a claim for respiratory disease if the uranium mining occurred on a reservation. Thus, the bill will allow for further filing of a claim by those miners, millers, and transport workers who did not have a work history on a reservation. In addition, the bill would change the current law so that requirements for written medical documentation is updated to allow for use of high resolution CAT scans and allow for written diagnoses by physician in either the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service to be considered conclusive. 
In 1990, we joined together in a bipartisan, bicameral effort and assured passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Now, either years later, I put forward this comprehensive amendment to RECA to correct some omissions, make RECA consistent with current medical knowledge, and to address what have become administrative horror stories for the claimants. I look forward to the debate in the Senate on this issue and hope that we can move to amend the current statue to ensure our original intent . . . fair and rapid compensation to those who served so well.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have spoken here many times in the past expressing strong support on the issues of pension reform and pension portability, and I would like to do so again today. 
I believe that the accumulation and availability of retirement savings is one of the most significant issues we face in our new economy. Yet while much of the current debate is focused on the viability of the Social Security system--and rightly so--we must not forget that this is only part of the administrative mechanisms we have in place that allow people to move from job to job and take care of their families. As my good friend and colleague from Vermont has already outlined in detail the specifics involved in our Retirement Portability Account bill, I will limit my own comments at this time to some issues I consider to be of special importance. 
Currently, employers and employees face three specific problems as individuals attempt to take their retirement funds with them as they change jobs over their career. 
The first problem is the specialized rules that have been established for the various kinds of accounts now available to employees. 401(k) plans for the private sector, 403(b) plans for non-profit organizations, 457 plans for state and local government employees, and so on all possess unique characteristics that are beneficial to individual employers and employees, but also make administrative compatibility between the plans problematic. 
The second problem concerns control of the funds accumulated by the employee, that is who is responsible for the paperwork as employees change jobs. This has been one of the foremost concerns of small business owners as they create accounts for a highly-mobile workforce. 
The third problem involves the ability of employees to `park' their accumulated funds somewhere until they have a new retirement plan. Here, the key has been to find a convenient way to use so-called `conduit IRA's' as a transfer mechanism into which funds can be transferred on their way to a different retirement savings plan. 
The Retirement Account Portability bill offered by Senator Jeffords and I has been developed to remedy these problems and more. This bill--a companion bill to the bipartisan bill introduced by our House colleagues, 
Representatives Earl Pomeroy and Jim Kolbe--is designed to accomplish two very specific and very important goals. 
First, the bill will begin the removal of the all too numerous and overly complex barriers that prevent employees from taking their retirement savings with them as they switch jobs. By both eliminating the redtape in the IRS Tax Code that unduly compartmentalizes various plan options and enhancing the effectiveness of conduit IRA's, it will allow individuals to roll their accumulated funds over into accounts at their current place of employment. 
This offers two tangible outcomes. First, it allows employees to keep track of their savings in an efficient manner. Second, it alleviates the burden placed on employers in terms of tracking and managing accounts of individuals that have moved on to other jobs. Based on discussions with my constituents, these represent dramatic improvements to current law, and, most significantly, allows individuals the opportunity to take advantage of the best investment options available to them. 
The second goal of the bill is, in my view, equally important. As you know, I believe that an internationally competitive economy entails first and foremost an effective diffusion of knowledge between firms and within regions. In the most dynamic regions in our country--Silicon Valley, Route 128, the Research Triangle--this is accomplished primarily by the movement of individuals from firm to firm and the iterative and cumulative interaction that results. This activity should be encouraged in every way possible, and the elimination of restrictions that prevent pension portability will assist in this effort. 
In conclusion, let me say that I consider this bill to be an initial but very important step to where we want to go in this country in terms of our savings policy. Our overarching goal is to increase the financial security of all Americans and create an economic environment where each and every individual can prosper. 
I would like to thank Senator Jeffords on the effort he has expended in crafting this bill, and I look forward to working with him in the future on ever more effective legislation.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senators Bond and Mikulski for their hard work in bringing this appropriations bill to floor. I realize it is a difficult task to accommodate so many members' requests, and I appreciate their efforts. I do want to bring to their attention, however, a project I believe is very worthy of funding. It is a multi-purpose in Shiprock, New Mexico, which is on the Navajo Indian Reservation. The center would primarily be for Navajo youth. I know the Senator from Maryland is well aware that juvenile crime, drug abuse, alcohol abuse and unemployment are very serious problems on the Navajo reservation. There is a desperate need to get these problems under control and give youth a meaningful alternative. This multi-purpose Center will do exactly that.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this Higher Education Act that we are engaged in discussing and debating here is a very important act. We only get around to it every 6 years, so this is not a subject like a lot of subjects around here that come up every year and we go through a dog and pony show here on the Senate floor. This issue comes up once every 6 years. The last time we reauthorized the Higher Education Act was in 1992. The next time we are expected to reauthorize the Higher Education Act will be 2004. So it is important that we get it right and do it right this year. 
I join with others who have spoken in congratulating Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for the leadership they have provided. We have a bipartisan bill. There are a number of incentives in this bill to streamline and strengthen the ways in which we deal with the issue of higher education in the country and the ways that we license and place teachers, including several provisions that I have recommended. 
But there is some unfinished business, Mr. President, and that is what my amendment tries to address. Let me go on and describe a little of the background before I describe the amendment itself. 
Teaching, of course, is our largest profession. We have close to 3 million people employed in teaching. To maintain and even increase the supply of teachers, the teacher preparation programs need to generate thousands of teaching candidates every year as we move ahead. The Federal Government is a major support for the students who go through these training programs. We provide $1.8 billion in student loans. Yet, we all know that the quality of these programs, in many cases, is inadequate, and we need to question this large Federal investment when we look at the quality of some of the teaching programs we are supporting. 
How is it that some universities can condone a rate of only 40 percent of their teacher education students passing licensing exams? How do I, as a Senator, explain to my constituents the investment of Federal tax dollars going to these institutions when they fail to prepare students to meet the exams that the States themselves are providing for people who want to teach? 
For this reason, I propose an amendment to the Higher Education Act to require accountability on the part of education schools and the universities that house those education schools. The amendment requires that States develop criteria to identify low-performing teacher preparation programs, including a State-determined pass rate on State licensing exams. 
It also proposes that States make a public list of the teacher preparation programs that meet the criteria for being labeled low performing; that States develop a list of suggested ways in which local teacher preparation programs can improve; and, finally, after a 4-year period--4 years into this 6-year reauthorization bill--if the State removed its approval from a teacher preparation program that the State itself felt had not made adequate improvement, then the Federal Government would support the State by withholding Federal funds from that program as well. 
That is what I have proposed. The education school accountability amendment was designed to ensure that teaching candidates have the baseline knowledge that they need before they go into the classroom. The amendment included a section on reporting. States and institutions would collect and publish the information needed by potential students to make informed decisions about enrollment in teacher preparation programs. 
I must say, Mr. President, that we have been able to work out a provision on accountability of schools of education, which is being included in the managers' amendment, which I think is a substantial step forward. It does not include many of the provisions I had urged, unfortunately. And I must say that I have been baffled by the response of the higher education community to this effort to impose a little more accountability for low-performing teacher preparation institutions--those institutions existing nearly in every State. 
In all the literature that has been distributed by that community in response to this amendment and the amendment Congressman Miller offered on the House side, I have not seen any attempt by the higher education community to take any responsibility or come up with any suggestions for how to deal with the problem, which we know is a real one. The entire substance of their argument was one that they opposed interference by the Government; they certainly didn't want the Federal Government involving itself in the role of the States, and they didn't want the States involving themselves in higher education programs any more than they presently do. Basically, they were saying that the higher education programs need to be left as they are, in spite of the problems that clearly exist. 
Most troubling to me was the lack of willingness even to report pass rates of teacher preparation programs. In a letter dated June 9, the American Council on Education indicated that reporting is too burdensome--the reporting that we were urging be accomplished. I don't really understand why it is possible for law schools and medical schools to publish their student pass rates, but not schools of education. Obviously, the question needs to be raised and answered: Is there something to hide? Is there some information they don't want out? I fear that that may be the case.  
Together we can help the colleges and universities to raise the status of teacher education to ensure that students enrolling in teacher education programs get the return on their investment that they expect and deserve. But we can't forget that the most important constituency for us to be concerned about is the children who are going to be served by the graduates of these education schools. I think we can make real progress if we impose some accountability there. 
Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered and sent to the desk is in addition to what has been agreed to in the managers' amendment. I commend the managers of the bill for agreeing to what I have already described. 
But the amendment that I am proposing says if you are training people to teach at the high school level--just at the high school level, not the elementary school level--if you are training people to teach at the high school level, give those people an academic major. Give them any education courses you want. Certainly courses in methods and courses in technique are fine, but don't turn out people to teach in our high schools who have only taken education courses. We are not saying that you have to have a major in the academic subject in which you wind up teaching. We are not putting in any kind of requirement like that in the law, only that you have to have some kind of academic major. 
This is not, let me make it very clear, Mr. President, an amendment which intends to bash teachers. It is just the opposite. The amendment is intended to support the good teachers we have in our education system today, to give them more good teachers to work with them in improving education. 
In my State we have many extremely well-qualified and committed teachers who do a wonderful job for very little pay. In my own family, both my parents devoted their careers to teaching. My sister is a teacher. I am a great believer in the value of good teachers. 
I believe the amendment I have offered will strengthen our ability to turn out good teachers and have those teachers in the classroom. We give a lot of speeches here about accountability. We need to make people more accountable. We need to make government more accountable. We need to make the institutions of government more accountable. I agree with all of that. The amendment I sent to the desk tries to do that very thing. It says to the schools that are training our teachers--give the new teachers that are coming out a good academic background. 
The problem has been discussed extensively. There has been a great deal of publicity about the recent testing that has occurred in Massachusetts, of course, and the inadequate percentage of people there who are able to pass the exam, the people who are getting ready to go into teaching. Similar problems exist in other States. The simple fact is you cannot teach something if you do not understand it. You have to have more than technique in order to be a good teacher. You have to also know the subject matter. You have to have good academic skills provided to the teachers or else the students cannot be expected to have good academic skills themselves. 
According to a recently completed analysis of State level student achievement data, students in States with more teachers holding certification plus a major in their field do significantly better on the national assessment of educational progress on reading and math exams than in States where this requirement is not available. Students of teachers who completed undergraduate activity majors and appropriate professional course- work achieve better than peers their own age whose teachers completed education majors. That is true no matter how poor the students are, no matter what their ethnicity, no matter whether English is their first language or their second language. 
Mr. President, let me start with two charts that I want to call to people's attention. This first chart makes the obvious point that there are 32 States that require teachers to complete an academic major for high school teaching, 30 that explicitly require that you have an academic major if you go into high school teaching, two others that require the equivalent of that. 
If any Senator wants to know whether his or her State already has this requirement in State law, they need to look at this chart. We have tried to provide copies of it. I am told we are not able to put copies on the Republican side of the aisle because there is some kind of a breakdown in our efforts to be bipartisan around here and we are only able to give them to the Democrats. But the chart is here. If anyone is willing to walk across the aisle, I would like to show them the chart. It is the same on both sides of the aisle. It makes the point, very clearly, that 32 States are now requiring the exact thing that we are trying to get done through this amendment. 
I have been asked to break the discussion so that the Senator from Iowa may speak.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make another point--that requiring an academic major saves money. Let me show this second chart which makes this point, I think, very graphically. 
This chart makes the point that entry and retention rates of teachers of teacher preparation programs that allow beginning teachers to complete a major in their subject and require a firm grounding in teaching skills is substantially higher than those programs, the traditional programs, that only have education courses in them. For every 100 candidates who are just in teacher education, 3 years after they complete their education only 28 of the 100 are still in teaching. We are training 72 of the people out of those 100 candidates in teacher education who don't stay in teaching more than 3 years. Those are the programs where they don't have an academic major. In the case where they do have an academic major, if you start with 100 candidates, after 3 years 75 of those candidates are still in teaching. 
Mr. President, it is clear to me that this is a good deal for the taxpayer to give these people an academic background, keep them in teaching, and don't wind up spending a lot of money to train people who are going to drop out of the teaching profession very quickly. So I think it is very important that we try to do this. 
Teachers with academic majors feel significantly better, are better prepared for their work, and they are significantly more likely to enter teaching following their preparation. Over 90 percent do enter teaching following their preparation, and they are much more likely to remain in the profession for more years. 
The Higher Education Act, which we are considering on the floor, encourages State and higher education institutions to implement an academic major requirement. But it does not make it a priority for deciding who gets funding. 
Given the evidence that directly links the acquisition of a major with student achievement, we are arguing with this amendment that the language of the bill should provide that those States that do not require a major for high school teachers would be required to develop a plan for implementation of that kind of requirement over the next 3 years. Requiring a major will help raise standards for entrance into the teaching profession. 
According to a recent study by the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, in the field of math, only 35 percent of women attending a major in education scored in the top two of the five proficiency levels in the subject. Male education majors are almost three times as likely to be below the lowest level of reading proficiency as their peers going into other majors. 
Professional organizations are weighing in on this issue in favor of what we are proposing in this amendment. The October 1997 Conference of the National Council of History Education conferees recommended that the colleges' education faculty be given the authority to reduce the number of generic methods courses in order to present team-taught courses with subject matter of scholars and seasoned teachers from the field. 
The National Science Teachers Association supports all efforts that encourage science teachers to major in the subject that they plan to teach and at the same time receive a teaching credential. 
If we expect higher standards of our students, as we all do, we need to provide them with teachers who have the content area preparation to help them meet those standards. 
That is an impossible task when 39.5 percent of science teachers do not even hold a minor in the subject that they are teaching. Thirty-four percent of math teachers and 25 percent of English teachers were similarly teaching outside their field. In many high-poverty schools, the percentage of out-of-field teachers can rise above 50 percent. Increasing the number of teachers with an academic major is one way to alleviate the problem. We owe our children a quality education, a quality teacher in every classroom, and this higher education amendment is a place to start in that effort. 
This bill, as I indicated earlier, only comes up once every 6 years. It is important, I believe, that we take this action tonight before we complete action on the bill. It is not enough to say we are going to study this for another 6 years. Either we believe that upgrading the quality of teaching is important or we do not. Let's not put off action until we are well into the next century. This is a chance to quit cursing the dark and to light a single candle. I do not think people who decide they should vote against this amendment should spend the next 6 years complaining about the poor quality of teaching in our schools. This is a chance to deal with that poor quality of teaching in a concrete way, and I hope people will support the amendment. 
Let me defer. I see my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Cochran from Mississippi, has risen to speak. Let me yield the floor so he can do so, Mr. President.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Connecticut, I would have to learn more of the detail precisely of what is done in Connecticut before I could answer the question. The source of the information that is reflected on this chart and that he has referred to as to which States already require this was Education Week magazine. They did interviews with the departments of education this last year, in September of 1997, and published this list. 
Our amendment does not say that you have to have a major in the subject you wind up teaching. It says you should have a major in a subject you intend to teach. Maybe there should be an exception in there for foreign language. I would be glad to entertain that modification, if the Senator thinks that is a problem. But the notion that you should go into high school teaching without ever having majored in anything, any academic subject, is the concern I have. We have schools around the country--and they are not the schools the Senator is thinking of generally, and that I generally think of when I think of teacher preparation--but there are schools around the country that are not requiring people to take academic course work before they turn them out to teach in our high schools. So you have people going through, with very good intentions, who want to become teachers, want to become high school teachers, who take a whole raft of education courses and then are turned out to teach, and they do not have the academic training that they need in order to properly prepare students.

Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to that question, I would say the amendment by its own language says the requirement doesn't take effect for 3 years. 
There is a period of time in which to adjust the language if we were to adopt the amendment. There is plenty of time to adjust it if it is onerous on a particular State. Of course, I would not want to withdraw the amendment because, quite frankly, I think we have a tendency--every 6 years when we get to this thing, the education schools around the country lobby heavily against any change in the law or in the requirements imposed on them. We will be here in the year 2004--at least some of you will be here in the year 2004--once again trying to decide whether it is appropriate to require anything of these schools. I do not want to withdraw the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just respond to the various points that have been made, and then I will yield the floor and we can get on to other business. I gather that it is not possible, because of the arrangements that have been previously made with some Senators, to go ahead with the vote. So it is going to be stacked for later. 
Let me just respond to a couple points that have been made. The notion that we are trying to micromanage by putting this requirement in Federal law, I do not think is accurate. We are saying, look, we give the States $1.8 billion to support these education training programs. Is it too much to ask that the education training programs that are being supported with this $1.8 billion provide academic instruction to the people who they are going to turn out to teach in our high schools? Is that too much to ask? 
I mean, we are not asking that that be done for the elementary schools. Fine, you can continue to turn out people for the elementary schools who take nothing but education courses. We are not trying to interfere with that. But if you are going to teach at the high school level, you ought to take some kind of academic training. That is what this amendment provides. 
The notion that this is overreaching by the Federal Government, the Senator from Indiana saying this violates the spirit or the policy that established the Department of Education, we have done the same thing with student loan default rates. We set it up with standards that need to be met. We have substantially reduced student loan default rates because of what we have done in that area. 
We say here, fine, if you do not want the $1.8 billion, then do anything you want. If you want the $1.8 billion, then we will give you 3 years in which to figure out how to begin providing academic instruction to the people who are going to teach in the high schools. 
I am in an awkward position here. Most of the people who have spoken against this amendment are from States that already require what the amendment is intended to require. 
I am from a State that does not require what the amendment is intended to require, and I think we should. I think the State of New Mexico ought to require that anyone who is going into high school teaching have a major in some academic subject, not necessarily the one they wind up teaching in but in some academic subject. 
I appreciate the concern of the Senator from Massachusetts and everyone else. They are genuinely concerned about what will happen to the 18 States. I represent one of the 18 States. I tell you what I think will happen to the 18 States. I think they will propose a little stiffer requirements. They will do a better job of teaching the teachers who are going into our schools. And I think the students of the country will benefit from that. 
I think this is a responsible thing to do. I hope very much Members will support the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to improve the academic preparation of our teachers. This is an area of great concern all around the country. The amendment says to States: You should require an academic major for the people you are training to teach in high schools--that in addition to the education course they take, they should have an academic major. Mr. President, 32 States already have in place this requirement. 
What we are saying is that over the next 3 years each State should be able to adopt a plan to get to this same point. It will substantially improve the preparation of teachers at the high school level. It has been shown to do that in the States that have adopted it. I believe this would be a very good policy for us to adopt as part of this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity. It will be 6 years, again, before we pass a reauthorization of the Higher Ed Act and we need to get on with the business of improving teaching in this country. This amendment will help to do that.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I introduce a private relief bill on behalf of a constituent from Sante Fe, New Mexico, Mr. Richard Barlow. It appears to me that his case represents a misuse of authority within the government in response to a public servant's concern that the Congress receive accurate information about important matters of national security. In recent years, the Congress has adopted measures to protect `whistle blowers' who step forward to identify grievous errors or abuses that occur within the government. Mr. Barlow's case involves government reprisal against a man who never actually blew the whistle, but indicated to his superiors that he might do so if they failed to correct misinformation that they had supplied to the Congress. Let me provide you with a brief outline of the case that I believe justifies filing this bill on his behalf. 
In the summer of 1989 officials from the Department of Defense provided information to the Congress on the sale of F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. Mr. Barlow concluded that the information provided was incorrect and misleading and indicated to his supervisor that he intended to correct that information. What followed is a history of reprisal leading to the loss of career, family, and income. The Department of Defense (DoD) suspended Mr. Barlow's high level security clearances and transferred him to other duties, while conducting its own investigation into the matter. When that investigation led to DoD's decision to terminate his employment, Mr. Barlow resigned. Because of that experience, Mr. Barlow has had significant personal problems including the dissolution of his marriage and long periods of under- and unemployment. 
As a constituent, Mr. Barlow asked for our help. In 1993, I asked the Inspector General of the DoD to review this case to see if it had been handled fairly. Because of the nature of the issue, Inspectors General (IG) from DoD, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the State Department reviewed the matter. The former two concluded that DoD had handled the matter fairly; the IG from the State Department disagreed. 
Mr. Barlow again appealed for my assistance to enlist the support of the Senate Armed Services Committee in investigating the case. Senators Thurmond and Nunn requested the General Accounting Office (GAO) to review the findings of the IG offices. Last summer, the GAO concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the findings of the DoD and CIA Inspectors General that Mr. Barlow's case had been handled fairly. 
Given those findings, I requested the Secretary of Defense to review the case to determine if Mr. Barlow should be compensated for the losses he incurred. The Secretary replied that, after a careful review, no compensation was warranted. 
Mr. President, I continue to believe that from the evidence I have reviewed, Mr. Barlow has been unfairly treated and is worthy of compensation for the price he has paid. 
Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today not only because I believe a constituent has been wronged, but because this case involves an issue that's virtually important to the effective functioning of the government. In my view, private relief bills are not undertaken lightly. They are appropriate in cases of individuals who have been wronged, who have exhausted all possible remedies for resolution, and whose case represents matters of important legal or policy matters. In Mr. Barlow's case, in order for the Congress to do its job, it must rely on timely and accurate information from all the agencies of the government, particularly when it involves matters of national security. In 1989 Mr. Barlow was very concerned about efforts in Pakistan to initiate a nuclear weapons program and that the Congress needed to know the full implications of selling nuclear capable F-16 aircraft to Pakistan. Recent history indicates how important those concerns were. 
Mr. President, although I believe compensation may be due to Mr. Barlow, I believe that such judgments require careful review by those experienced in such matters such as the Court of Claims. The Court will report its findings back to the Senate to guide our deliberations before determining the outcome of this bill. I hope that the Court will perform its review quickly and report their findings to the Senate in order for us to resolve this matter before the end of this session of the Congress.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last Tuesday, June 30, 1998, the research and experimentation tax credit expired, once again. Once again, U.S. industry was left in a state of uncertainty as to how to value its investments in research and development, which are really investments in the economic future of our country. Today, I am introducing a bill to extend permanently and improve the research and experimentation tax credit. It is the fruit of analysis from the staff of the Joint Economic Committee, of which I am the ranking member. It is also the product of consultations with a spectrum of groups who share my concern for our Nation's future scientific and technological strength. The bill would, briefly, make the existing R&E tax credit permanent, improve the economic efficiency and practicality of the alternative incremental credit, convert the existing basic research credit into a flat credit, and accompany the basic research credit (which is aimed mostly at research in universities) with a new credit for nonprofit research consortia. The bill also makes a number of technical and clarifying adjustments to the basic research credit, so that it will be easier to use. 
I am not the first Member of this body to propose to make the R&E tax credit permanent, or to propose improvements in its functioning. I plan to work with other similarly-minded Senators in the days to come to see if we can construct an even broader coalition to make these permanent improvements in the R&E tax credit a reality this year.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this amendment. I cosponsored the bill on which it is based, S. 1874, with Senator Domenici and our offices have worked closely together with the Administration and with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to get this amendment cleared. I believe that the amendment accomplishes several important objectives. It clarifies the ability of the Department to engage in mutually beneficial research and development interactions with external partners. It reduces red tape associated with these interactions. It encourages DOE facilities to cooperate with small businesses. These are all steps that strengthen DOE's research capabilities at all its facilities and increase the contribution that the Department can make to our national research and innovation system. I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will oppose the Coverdell education IRA bill. In my view, it provides precious little help to parents and even less help to schools. The IRA provisions of the bill do not provide any real opportunity for schools to improve themselves. In the debate we had here in the Senate, it was clear that most of the efforts to improve the bill and get to what I would refer to as core educational issues were rejected. And one key provision that was accepted has, of course, now been stripped out of the bill by the conference committee; that is, a provision that tries to address the very serious dropout crisis that we have in our schools. 
I believe that a failure to give attention to this crisis is perhaps the best example of the limitations of this bill. Each day that there is school in this country, we have an average of 3,000 students between grades 7 and 12 who leave school and leave permanently before graduating. In many schools, the graduating class is half the size of the entering freshman class of 4 years before. 
Unfortunately, a disproportionate number of the students who are dropping out are Hispanic. We see that problem in real terms in my home State where our Hispanic population is large. Those students often attend the most overcrowded and least well-equipped schools in the Nation. The vast majority of our dropouts are not Hispanic, though, and they are Anglo students--students from all ethnic and racial backgrounds who are bothered with watered-down classes. They are alienated from large schools where nobody seems to care about the work they do. 
To address this problem, I proposed an amendment, along with Senator Reed, which was the dropout prevention provision of the bill. The Senate adopted this proposal to provide $150 million in dropout prevention funds to authorize that funding by a vote of 74-26. So, clearly, there was strong support here in the Senate for this initiative. 
With this $150 million, we could have provided funding to help schools that have the highest dropout rates, to reduce those dropout rates and transform their educational programs so that students would stay. With the $150 million, we could have taken the first concrete steps toward meeting the bipartisan goal that President Bush and the 50 Governors agreed to back in 1989 when they met in Charlottesville. The goal was that at least 90 percent of our students would complete high school. Despite the obvious need for this dropout prevention effort and the overwhelming support that we had here in the Senate for this amendment, the provision has been dropped from the bill that is before us today. 
I believe that the House and Senate need to address these core educational issues. I hope very much that there is an opportunity in the appropriations bills that we consider to have a serious debate and hopefully do better to get the Federal Government on the side of addressing core educational issues. 
This conference report that we are going to vote on does little, but it promises much. In that regard, I think the people of the country are being misled about the extent of the effort and extent of the accomplishment that we are talking about today. I was very proud to be with Senator Reed, Congressman Hinojosa, and well-known actress/entertainer Rita Moreno yesterday at a press conference where we talked about the importance of the dropout problem and the importance of getting Federal support to deal with that. I am disappointed that the conference report on this Coverdell bill does not include any provision to help address the crisis. 
I intend to vote against the bill.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will make some comments on the defense bill that we are considering. 
This defense authorization bill, as reported by the Armed Services Committee, contains essential elements to ensure that our military men and women and the equipment that we have are prepared to respond when and if needed for our national security. Funds are included in the bill that continue to modernize the force and continue to improve the quality of life for our military personnel and families. 
The bill remains within the limits of last year's budget agreement. It cuts spending by about 1 percent in real terms from last year. The committee approved a budget of $270.6 billion in budget authority. 
The bill represents a number of very difficult choices--choices that we had to make when we proposed increases in funding for the programs that the committee wanted to increase. For every dollar of increase, of course, we had to find funds elsewhere and, accordingly, there are some cuts in the budget that came from the administration. There are a few significant departures from funding levels in programs that were in the budget last year. In my view, it is a more `responsible' budget than we have had here on the Senate floor in several years with regard to our defense spending. 
That said, the relative stability in the bill can be a good thing. It can also prevent us from moving swiftly in important directions that require a timely response. I want to speak to some of those in a moment. 
At its best, the bill takes good care of the military personnel and their families. It contains a 3.1 percent pay raise, effective January 1, and three health care demonstration projects for retired military personnel, who are over 65, and for their families. These projects are designed to meet the concerns voiced by retirees who have served their country and seek equitable and quality health care services. There is a provision to enhance cooperation between the Veterans' Administration and the Department of Defense in providing health care to dual-eligible beneficiaries. There is a continuation of pilot and nuclear personnel bonuses and increased limits on certain bonuses to enhance recruitment and retention. There is increased funding for construction and upgrades of family housing. There are provisions to make it easier for military families to move when they are required to move. 
For my home State of New Mexico, the bill includes significant funding for our military bases and our National Laboratories that will benefit not only my State but the Nation. It includes funds for the High Energy Laser Test Facility and the Tactical High Energy Laser Program at White Sands Missile Range. It includes funding for the high-tech research being conducted at Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque. It includes substantial funding for the defense programs at Los Alamos and Sandia to support their work in the stockpile stewardship program, nonproliferation research and development, and nuclear security assistance programs. It includes funds for military construction projects that we have been seeking--a new support facility for National Guard in Taos, NM, refurbishment of facilities and new family housing at Kirtland Air Force Base, a new war readiness facility at Holloman Air Force Base, and a badly needed runway repair project at Cannon Air Force Base. 
Mr. President, for all the good things that this bill provides for our military personnel and to the facilities in my State and to the Nation, there are still some aspects of the bill that I find troubling. 
The bill continues to place relatively greater emphasis on programs that address potential, rather than actual, long-term threats for which there is no current deployment requirement. Increased spending in those areas has come at the expense of programs designed to meet near-term threats which are actual and for which validated requirements exist. 
For example, the bill contains $1.1 billion for strategic missile defense programs, including national missile defense and space-based laser programs; that is an increase of $100 million over the President's request. That $1.1 billion is compared to $675 million for programs designed to reduce the threat of 
proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The committee approved cuts in funding to proliferation prevention programs at a time when India's actions, and now Pakistan's actions, remind us of the immediacy of such threats. 
Information provided to the committee indicates that the intercontinental ballistic missile threat for which the national missile defense is intended is limited. The Intelligence people told our committee that such threats from rogue nations are not likely to occur for many years in the future. 
The tradeoff seems clear to me. The committee prefers to allocate the lion's share of resources to meet a poorly defined threat that lies somewhere in the distant future, rather than allocating resources to meet the near-term, real world threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
Particularly, the bill does not fully fund programs intended to meet the threat of proliferation of weapons grade fissile materials, highly enriched uranium, and plutonium. A small amount of any of these materials in knowledgeable hands could wreak havoc upon our cities. 
It is extremely important that we continue to work cooperatively with Russia and with other former Soviet States to account for and secure former Soviet nuclear weapons and related nuclear materials. 
Despite the clear and present danger of that threat, the committee chose to reduce funding for the DOD's cooperative threat reduction program, also known as the Nunn-Lugar program, by $2 million after considering much deeper cuts. 
The committee cut similar programs managed by the Department of Energy by $20 million. Those programs are designed to improve the security of Russian nuclear weapons and materials and to provide protection against their theft, unauthorized use, or accidental misuse. 
The Department of Energy's materials protection control and accounting program provides those security measures to a small portion of Russia's nuclear arsenal. With more funding, that program could provide greater security against the threat of smuggling dangerous materials to terrorists or rogue nations. 
Instead, if the bill is passed as it stands, funding for this program--an essential program for our Nation's security now and in the future--is going to be cut. Efforts to secure hundreds of tons of nuclear materials at 53 sites will be delayed. 
Mr. President, I spoke of India and Pakistan a moment ago. I would like to take a few more minutes to relate that problem to this defense bill. Shocking as India and Pakistan's nuclear tests have been, they should serve as a wakeup call to this country and to the Senate. The proliferation clock ticks on, while the Senate defers debate and consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Other nonnuclear States could be reconsidering their positions on nuclear weapons in light of events in south Asia. 
China, who is a signatory to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, may now choose not to ratify. The U.S: the first to sign the treaty--should have led the effort to implement a comprehensive testing ban before now. Perhaps our leadership in that area could have forestalled the tests in south Asia. Instead, the Senate has chosen not to step forward. Now we see ourselves more as a follower than as a leader in this area. 
One element that could support a leadership role in ratifying a comprehensive test ban is an effective nuclear stockpile stewardship program. That program is an essential element for ensuring the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons in the absence of testing. The directors of our National Laboratories at Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia have testified about the effectiveness of that program in the absence of nuclear testing. In spite of that testimony, this bill reduces funding by $145 million in prior year balances that, according to the DOE, no longer exist. 
Without sufficient funding for the stockpile stewardship program, this bill threatens the likelihood of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Failure to ratify that treaty plays into the hands of the Indian and Pakistani Governments and could encourage other nonnuclear nations to follow their lead. The result will be a far more dangerous world than the one we live in today. 
Mr. President, I am concerned that while many of my colleagues are focused on the long-term future security issues, they may have their focus in the wrong place. Funding for basic research and development and building, the building blocks for future technological advances, continues to receive low priority in this defense budget. 
It is not anticipated to increase for the foreseeable future under current Department of Defense plans. 
My colleagues acknowledged when considering this bill that funding for basic research and development has often been and remains a bill payer for other programs. 
Efforts to identify this problem and establish long-term spending goals for basic research were rejected during the deliberations in the committee on this bill. 
I believe that the high-tech future so many of us in the Senate consider an axiom of America's future security is unlikely to become a reality in the defense area unless we make the investment that is needed in the future today. 
In addition, funding for the Nation's test and evaluation facilities and their operations lags behind efforts to modernize our weapons. 
I have seen this with personnel cuts, neglect of infrastructure, and aging instrumentation at White Sands Missile Range in my State. These cuts reflect a low priority that has been given to the testing activities across the Department of Defense in this budget. 
These cuts suggest that even if our technical genius continues to provide new technological opportunities, we may not be able to adequately evaluate whether they will actually work as intended. 
Mr. President, I am concerned about the inertia contained in this bill. I believe that in many ways it fails to meet our most immediate high priority security concerns. It may also fail to lay a sound scientific foundation for the long-term security needs of our country. 
I urge my colleagues to consider these large issues as we consider the bill this week. We have an opportunity to fix some of these problems. I hope we are able to do so. I intend to have one or more amendments to offer later in the week which will help us to accomplish that. 
Mr. President, let me yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum at this point.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since we do have a lull in the proceedings, I have filed two amendments that together would incorporate in this year's defense bill the key provisions of S. 2081, which is the National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998. Consistent with the strong bipartisan support for defense research, I am very pleased to say that we have Senator Santorum, Senator Lieberman, Senator Lott, Senator Frist, all as original cosponsors of this bill and also as sponsors of these complementary amendments. 
I will not, of course, try to get a vote on these at this point because it would require unanimous consent to do so, but I would like to just briefly describe what the amendments do so when the opportunity comes to have a vote, people will be informed. 
These amendments lay the fiscal framework for the defense research that is needed to achieve, early in the next century, what the Department of Defense calls full spectrum dominance, that is the ability of our Armed Forces to dominate potential adversaries across the entire spectrum of military operations, from humanitarian operations through the highest intensity conflicted. 
One of the two amendments sets goals that would result in the Defense Science and Technology Program budget reaching the equivalent of at least $9 billion in today's dollars by the year 2008; that would be an increase of 16 percent above today's level. The other amendment sets similar increased goals for the nonproliferation research at the Department of Energy. 
It is worth focusing on why defense research is so important. Much of the technology that gave the United States a quick victory with so very few casualties in Desert Storm came 
out of defense-related research in the 1960s and 1970s. Those kinds of results, plus the fact that our military remains the most technologically sophisticated in the world, have fostered a broad agreement that defense research is one of the best investments that our country makes, one providing enormous long-term returns to our military. Even with the cold war over, there are a number of reasons why now is the time to vigorously invest in defense research. 
First, as the Department of Defense has noted, the two keys to this full spectrum dominance, which is the cornerstone of our strategy as we move forward--the two keys will be information superiority and, second, technological innovation. 
The Department of Defense has been the preeminent Federal agency funding the disciplines that undergird these two key enablers, for example, supporting roughly 80 percent of the federally sponsored research in electrical engineering, 50 percent of that in computer science and mathematics. No other organizations, public or private, can substitute for the unique role and focus of the Department of Defense in these research areas. We simply will not be able to achieve this so-called full spectrum dominance without a vigorous program of defense research. 
A second important point is that the global spread of advanced technology and a nascent revolution in military affairs are creating new threats to the United States which will challenge our ability to achieve full spectrum dominance. Those are threats requiring new responses and requiring new technology. They include information warfare; cheap, precise cruise missiles and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
Recent events in India and Pakistan, which I alluded to earlier, may have concentrated our thinking on this last problem, this threat of the spread of weapons of mass destruction. In the words of the National Defense Panel, `We must lead the coming technological revolution or be vulnerable to it.' That said, right now we are in a relatively secure interlude in our international relations. We are in a time where we can afford to work on transforming our military forces. While the world is still a dangerous place, it will be even more dangerous in the future. So now is the time for the defense research to be accomplished, which is needed to achieve this full spectrum dominance. 
When you look, though, at DOD's current science and technology budget plans, they do not reflect these realities. The out-year budgets are basically flat in real terms, out to the year 2003, at a level of around $200 million lower than the 1998 level. This is the money that pays for the research and concept experimentation needed to invent and try out new military capabilities. Worse yet, the budget of the Department of Energy for nonproliferation research is slated to decline by about 20 percent in real terms by the year 2003. 
These budget plans are not consistent with the vision of full spectrum dominance. They are not consistent with the threats on the horizon or with the opportunity that we have today. These two amendments that I filed would promote budget plans that are consistent with the vision, threats and opportunity. What they do is this: From fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year 2008, the first amendment would give the Secretary of Defense a goal--not a requirement, but a goal--to increase the defense science and technology budget request by at least 2 percent a year over inflation greater than the previous year's budget request. The other amendment gives the same 2 percent goal, 2 percent increased goal to the Secretary of Energy for nonproliferation research. 
The end result will be a defense science and technology budget that reaches at least $9 billion in today's dollars by 2008, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 16 percent over the 1998 level. The budget for nonproliferation research would increase it around 23 percent over today's level. 
These budget increases are significant for research, yet they are modest and achievable when you look at our overall defense budget. If you look at a graph of the projected Science and Technology Program budget under this agreement, you can see that the increases will be, No. 1, gradual; that is, the total increase by 2008 will be less than some year-to-year changes in the past. Also, the increase will be smooth in that they will not be a huge change from the Defense Department's current plans at the start. They will also be reasonable; the $9 billion endpoint is comparable with previous levels of science after technology funding. 
Achieving these increases will require some shifting the funds within the DOD budget. The total amount shifted will be only around half a percent of the total DOD budget over 10 years. 
I am extremely confident the Secretary of Defense will be able to make this kind of gradual shift without damaging other priorities. I am also quite sure that this is a priority need for our country. 
Technological supremacy has been a keystone of our security strategy since World War II. Supporting that supremacy has been this defense research. The coming decade is the time to start increasing the investment in our national security. These amendments are a modest bipartisan, sensible and achievable approach to make that investment. I am sure that these modest increases will yield substantial returns to our military. 
I hope that when we get an opportunity to vote on these amendments that my colleagues will join me and Senators Santorum, Lieberman, Lott and Frist in supporting both of these important amendments. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the energy and water development appropriations bill and to take a few moments to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee on one of the many important programs being funded in the bill. That would be the technology transfer and education programs funded under Atomic Energy Defense Activities. These programs are an important investment in the future of the country, by leveraging the facilities, expertise, and R&D results funded by the Department's defense missions to the benefit of broader national science, technology, and education objectives. We have seen some important spin-offs over the years from DOE defense-related research, and this funding will ensure that we continue to see both spin-off and the flow of technology, ideas, and trained personnel into the labs, to the benefit of the Department's important statutory missions. 
One example of a technology partnership area of importance, and which I hope the Department will fully fund in fiscal year 1999, is the Advanced Computational Technology Initiative, or ACTI. The ACTI program makes available to smaller oil and gas producers the computational and simulation resources of the national laboratories. One component of the ACTI program over the years, the Advanced Reservoir Management program, has funded advances in complex computational database management and electronic information systems that have been of benefit both to the oil and gas industry and DOE's defense programs. 
I know that my colleague from New Mexico, the chairman of the subcommittee, is a strong supporter of our oil and gas industry. I would urge him to maintain funding of the ACTI program at the level of the President's request as this bill moves forward to conference.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my very enthusiastic support for the micro-enterprise bill being introduced by Senator Kennedy. Programs of this type provide technical support and funding to thousands of potentially productive Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and are looking for a way out of their current precarious economic situation. 
I have visited microenterprise businesses in my state and know they work. These individuals possess energy, ingenuity, desire, and vision but currently lack access to three important ingredients that will allow them to be successful in their entrepreneurial efforts: business management training, knowledge of the market, and affordable capital. This bill will provide all three ingredients, and will do so in areas of the country that need economic assistance. 
Microenterprise is not charity and it does not foster dependence. Instead, it encourages individuals to use their specific strengths and creativity to support themselves and their community. It is a market-based approach to economic empowerment and self-reliance that has proven to be successful both here and overseas, and it deserves to be expanded. It offers an alternative to poverty and provides the means by 
which individuals and communities can be saved from cycles of isolation, violence, and despair. 
In New Mexico, I have seen the tangible results of microenterprise programs. One organization we have interacted with, ACCION, provided funds for Michael and Jamie Ford to begin a very successful business selling flies for fly-fishing in their community and over the Internet. They were recently named the Small Business Administration's Welfare-to-Work Entrepreneur of the Year in New Mexico. Another organization, the New Mexico Business Resource Center, recommended that funds be provided through New Mexico Community Development Loan Fund to Kevin Bellinger, who created a unique art and dance program for disadvantaged youths called Harambe. Here, low-income individuals are taught to interact in non-violent and constructive ways and give back to the community in which they live. Mr. Bellinger was recently selected by New Mexico Newspaper as one of the top ten people in Santa Fe making a real difference in their community. 
In Taos, the Taos County Economic Development Corporation providing funding for the Taos Food Center, a commercial kitchen that acts as an incubator for small-scale food producers and farmers in the region. 
Previously, these individuals could not afford to rent space, buy commercial and office equipment, or market their products. With the assistance of microenterprise funds, the Taos Food Center provides the space and the equipment and provides on-site technical and business assistance. This allows individuals to rent the facility by the hour, and convert their crops into marketable products. 
Other microenterprise organizations in New Mexico--the Rio Grande Community Development Corporation, La Jicarita Enterprise Community, WESST Corp., and so on--have had similarly stellar results. They play essential roles in their communities, and they should be commended for their efforts. 
In April, I organized a roundtable discussion of all the microenterprise organizations operating in New Mexico. This was the first time representatives from these organizations met in the same location to discuss their respective philosophies, objectives, and strategies concerning microenterprise, and it was very beneficial to all of us. The dialogue with the organizations that began that day has continued to the present, and has only reinforced by commitment to these programs. The simple fact is: the work, and they work well. 
The bill we are introducing today would accomplish several important tasks: 
First, it will provide training, technical assistance, and start-up funds to potential entrepreneurs who are currently disadvantaged but eager to change their economic condition; 
Second, it will provide training and capacity building services to microenterprise development organizations, an activity that will lead directly to the expansion of microenterprise funding and an increased number of clients being served; 
Third, it will identify best practices in microenterprise technical and lending services, an activity that will further enhance efforts to provide funds to individuals in an efficient and effective manner; 
Finally, it will ensure that microenterprise lending occurs in all areas that require assistance--meaning both rural and urban communities. 
Let me conclude by thanking my colleague from Massachusetts and his staff for their work on this bill. I have been pleased to work with Senator Kennedy on the development of the components contained within the bill, in particular those related to rural communities and Indian reservations. I believe that this bill will have a profound effect on the ability of low-income individuals to establish businesses, develop new products and services, and create new jobs. All of these activities can only help individuals and communities in the United States in a positive way.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say a few words about the tobacco bill which we have been on here for a couple, 3 weeks now in the Senate. 
In my opinion, this tobacco bill is a historic piece of legislation. And I have complimented personally the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, for his leadership in the Commerce Committee and here on the Senate floor in bringing this bill here and pushing for its enactment. I believe very strongly that when historians look back on the 105th Congress and ask, What did the 105th Congress accomplish? if we are able to pass tobacco legislation, significant tobacco legislation, that will be the single item they will point to as a substantial and major accomplishment by this Congress. So the time we are spending on this tobacco bill is time well spent. 
I firmly believe that since I have been here in the Senate--and I have been here now nearly 16 years--during that time there has been a dramatic change in public opinion on the issue of smoking and tobacco use in this country, particularly on the issue of young people beginning to smoke. 
What I see this legislation as is an effort to bring our public policy into line with our public opinion, because public opinion has changed dramatically. Our public policy has not changed to the same extent, and we need to get on with the business of changing public policy to mirror and reflect what the American people want to see done. That is why the legislation is so important. 
We have spent many hours discussing this legislation. We have had several amendments offered and debated, and several adopted. I think all of that is to the good. And I think anyone who has watched the Senate operate for any period of time would have to acknowledge that, although we have spent substantial time on the tobacco bill, so far we have not seen a concerted effort by the leadership to bring this issue to a close, to bring the debate to a close, to get a defined list of amendments that need to be concluded before we can finish the bill and move on to another item. 
So, clearly, that is our agenda for this week. I believe very strongly we can finish this bill this week, or certainly if not this week, we can finish it next week. We owe it to the American people to do that. 
I know there are others in the Senate who have different opinions on that. We have heard a lot of public statements over the recent weeks and months about how this bill is dead and how the bill is dead on arrival. And I have thought, if I had a dollar for every statement that has been uttered about how this bill is dead, I would be a rich man today. Mark Twain was famous for his statement that the news reports of his demise were exaggerated. And I think that the news reports about this bill being dead are exaggerated as well. 
I think there is ample support here in the Senate to pass this bill. There is ample support in this Senate to pass a strong bill, to send it to conference, and I hope that there is support in the House of Representatives to do the same thing. Time will tell whether that turns out to be the case. 
So I believe very strongly we need to go ahead and get a cloture motion filed again. I hope Senator McCain, the lead sponsor of the bill, will take that initiative. 
I think we need to get a defined list of amendments that still need consideration once that cloture motion is completed, and then we need to go ahead and conclude action on the bill. 
I believe the best thing we can do for the American people before the Fourth of July break--and the Fourth of July break will begin the Friday after this Friday--the most important thing we can do for the American people is, prior to that date, going ahead and passing this historic legislation and sending it to conference. 
I urge the majority leader to use the power of his position, which is substantial, to move the bill forward. I compliment all my colleagues who have voted for cloture in the previous efforts to bring closure to the debate and to get a limited list of amendments for further consideration. But I urge everyone, this week, to vote for cloture. I hope we can get that done. I hope we can pass a bill with a strong bipartisan vote and send it to conference. I think the American people will thank us for that action, and we owe that to them.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I respond to the question by just saying I believe we have this week and we have next week. There is no more important activity we can commit that time to than completing action on this bill. I think the momentum for moving ahead on the bill will be lost if we don't get it done before we break for the Fourth of July recess. 
Clearly, the notion of giving up on this and moving to another piece of legislation--I don't know of any other piece of legislation that is so urgent or so important that it would justify going off of this bill. I am not aware of anything on the Senate's schedule that would justify that action.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think that is clearly the case. 
I think although there have been some far-reaching amendments added to the bill, the central core of the bill remains the same. It remains an effort to deal with the problem of young people beginning to smoke. And, of course, it is a public health issue. 
That is the reason I believe this legislation is historic, because it goes directly at dealing with the major public health issue that is before this country today and that can be dealt with. So, I think it is extremely important we move ahead. 
I understand there are particular provisions of the bill and particular provisions of some of the amendments that various Members don't like, but it is almost ironic because you hear people come to the floor and support amendments to the bill and then use the fact that those amendments have been adopted as a reason for claiming that the bill is now so loaded down that we can't support the bill. To my mind, the right course is for us to go ahead and pass the bill, consider remaining amendments, adopt those that have the votes there to adopt, pass the bill in that form, get it to conference, and hopefully the House will do the same. 
I believe that the same people who are urging me as a Senator to take action on this important public health issue are urging Congressmen from my State to take action on this important public health issue as well. I hope that if we do the right thing before the Fourth of July break, the House will come back in July and do the right thing by passing a responsible bill and then we will be able to get a conference and get something that we can send to the President before we adjourn this fall. That is what is important. We have a historic opportunity here. I hope very much we will rise to the occasion. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce a bill to resolve a long standing controversy between many citizens of my State of New Mexico, and their government. 
In 1848, the United States entered into a treaty with Mexico to end the Mexican/American War called the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. In that treaty, Mexico ceded an enormous tract of land that was to become the American Southwest including the State of New Mexico. In return the Treaty stipulated that the property rights of the Mexican citizens who lived in the area, and who were to become new citizens of the United States, would be protected. 
We must recall that these new citizens had had a long, and sometimes ancient, connection to the land. The Native American tribal peoples who had lived there for thousands of years, had become citizens of Spain and then Mexico. Also many of those new citizens of Spanish descent had a family heritage of living on the this land dating back 250 years to 1598, when the Spanish colonial capital in New Mexico was established at San Juan Pueblo. They had built towns and cities, churches, and vast irrigation systems for their farms. 
Unfortunately, the treaty provisions protecting title to land were not well and evenly implemented. It has been fairly well documented by scholars such as Professor Malcolm Ebright at the University of New Mexico, and Professor Emeritus Michael Meyer from the University of Northern Arizona, that many people lost title to their land who should have been protected by the treaty. In some cases this was due to faulty surveying by the Surveyor General, in some cases it was due to a lack of knowledge by American Territorial Courts about how title was acquired under Spanish and Mexican law, and most egregiously people sometimes lost their land through outright fraud by government officials and land speculators. 
As I said earlier, the implementation of the treaty was not uniform. In some areas property rights were fairly well adhered to, but in others legitimate titles were wiped out wholesale. A group of people that were particularly hurt in this process were the relatively poor subsistence farmers and ranchers living in northern New Mexico. These new American citizens were easy prey for land speculators. Not only were they learning a new language and legal system, but usually they did not have the financial resources to defend their property rights in the courts. In some cases, people were told that if they signed a given document that they would be assured the continued use of their land forever. However in reality, what they were signing were quit claim deeds, giving title to their land to some nefarious speculator. 
The ramifications of this history have caused bitter disputes and economic hardship in northern New Mexico for generations. The issue is still relevant for many New Mexicans feel their government has an obligation to compensate them for their loss of land. In many cases they may be right. 
Mr. President, after 150 years it may not be possible or practicable to revisit the thousands of title claims originally made in 1848. So much time has passed, and so many title transfers have taken place since then that the legal review could be a never ending legal maze. However, Spanish and Mexican law recognized community as well as individual land titles. Under a grant from the King of Spain or the Mexican government, whole communities had a claim on certain lands. These community land grants form a distinct, and often better documented, subset of the claims made under the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Given that this is a smaller, more defined group of claims, and because of they affect whole communities, it may be possible to settle these long standing claims and provide a sense of justice to people in northern New Mexico. 
Last year former Representative Richardson introduced a bill, H.R. 260, to create a commission to study and recommend settlement of these claims. His successor in office, Representative Redmond has carried on this issue in his own bill, H.R. 2538. These bills have been useful in bringing the issue to national attention and I commend both of my colleagues for introducing them. 
Mr. President, my bill, which I call the Fair Deal for Northern New Mexico Act, builds upon the efforts in the other body. For example, the House bill is focused on an exhaustive legal review of the various community land grant claims and whether land should be transferred back to the claimants. My bill also has a review of these claims, but acknowledges that after 150 years, that we may never be able to reach legal certainty in some cases. We may find that a claim is colorable, that it has a legal basis, but not exactly what is owed. Also, we may find that the other people in the community currently either own the land in question, or if it's federal land, they may have long standing leases on which they depend. For that reason, my bill creates a package of options for settlement of these claims with the involvement and support of the whole community that would be affected. 
I won't dwell on the differences between this bill and the one in the House because I see this bill as a broadening and strengthening of that effort. Let me just run briefly what my bill would do, and my hope is that as this works its way through committee and on the floor that we'll reach an agreement with the House sponsors on legislation that will resolve this long standing legal dispute in New Mexico. 
My bill has three key components: the creation of county-wide settlement committees, the reasonable but expedited time-frame, and a broad range of settlement options. First, it would create seven member settlement committees, one for each county in New Mexico in which their are these community land grant claims. To get the federal agencies actively involved in a solution to the issue, the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior would each have a representative on these committees. The State Lands Commissioner would represent the interests of the State's educational trust fund. Finally, each county commission would appoint four representatives, at least one of which must be a Tribal member if there is an Indian Pueblo within that county, and at least one of which is a non-Indian heir to a Spanish or Mexican Land Grant. 
Second, the bill tries to keep the issue on the front burner by limiting the settlement committees to a set schedule. The settlement committees would have ninety days to publish a set of guidelines on to how to document a land claim, and then people would have one year to file their claims. These committees would then have three years in which to review the claims and develop a proposed settlement to be submitted to Congress. 
The whole process from creation of these committees to proposals to Congress would take about five years. I think this very important. It should be long enough to develop some solid settlement proposals, but it is a short enough time-frame that the people in New Mexico will see action before they just become frustrated. 
Finally, the settlement committees would have a number of options to choose from to create a settlement that will satisfy the claims and the communities in which they are made. As with the House bill, one options would be to transfer land directly back to a particular community land grant. However, the committee might propose that federal lands be set aside for under special designations for community use, or that lands should be transferred to local municipalities to benefit everyone in the community. Further, a settlement committee could recommend that a package of economic develop grants or tuition scholarships would better meet the current needs of claimants and the community than a transfer of whatever land might be available. All of these options would be tools available to a county settlement committee to use in crafting a settlement that the people of that county would find to be fair and just. 
Mr. President, it is time for the United States to respond to its citizens on this issue, to bring this controversy to closure, and to give the citizens of northern New Mexico a sense that justice has been done so that they can move forward both socially and economically without this cloud from the past hanging over them. I think this bill will move us forward towards those goals. I would like to call on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to hold hearings on this bill at the earliest possible time. I hope to work with the rest of the New Mexico delegation and the other members of Congress to pass good legislation regarding the issue.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak in support of this important legislation being introduced today by my friend Senator Domenici. The bill designates the old Highway 66 as `America's Main Street' and authorizes the National Park Service to help state, tribal and local governments in their efforts to preserve this unique piece of our national heritage. 
Mr. President, Route 66 is more than a 2400-mile highway from Chicago to Los Angeles. In many ways it represents the American dream, the open road, and our unending search for opportunity and adventure. This is the `Mother Road' of John Steinbeck's classic 1939 novel `The Grapes of Wrath.' This is the road immortalized by Cole Porter and Jack Kerouac. In the 1950s, this is the road that gave us the popular television series `Route 66.' 
In my state of New Mexico, Route 66 ran nearly 400 miles from Glenrio in Quay County on the east to Manuelito in McKinley County on the West. Before 1937, the road looped north through Santa Fe and Bernalillo and south through Isleta and Los Lunas. Many of us believe the state of New Mexico has some of the most compelling scenery along the highway. 
Mr. President, from the beginning Route 66 was intended to link America's rural and urban areas. Much of the original roadway remains along with those old classic filling stations, cafes, motels, and, of course, those unforgettable neon signs. Indeed, the old highway remains the `main street' in many New Mexico cities, including Albuquerque, Tucumcari, Santa Rosa, Bernalillo, Gallup, and Grants. 
I think it is unfortunate that many drivers on our modern Interstate 40 cross New Mexico without pausing to enjoy the nostalgia of the old highway. That's why I am pleased that New Mexico is already working aggressively to preserve and memorialize the old highway. The route in New Mexico is now designated a scenic byway. Our state has worked hard to provide appropriate signage, and the familiar brown and white shield signs are now prominent along the old route. A number of New Mexico towns and pueblos have permanent exhibits on the history of Route 66 in their areas. The city of Tucumcari has a whimsical monument to Route 66 modeled after a Cadillac tail fin. Soon there will be a Route 66 interpretative center at the Pueblo of Acoma that will showcase the historic and cultural attractions of the region. A similar center is planned for the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque. 
Mr. President, Route 66 received its original designation in 1926 as a result of the first national highway plan. Now, over seventy years later, Congress has just passed a new highway bill that clearly recognizes through the Enhancements and Scenic Byways Programs the importance of preserving and protecting our national heritage. With the automobile firmly entrenched in our culture today, highways such as Route 66 are a genuine part of our heritage. This bill will help assure that heritage is preserved. I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill with Senator Domenici, and I thank him for his efforts.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, in introducing the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act of 1998. 
I want to begin by commending the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for bringing this issue before the Senate. As my colleagues know, in the short time he has been in the Senate, Senator Enzi has become one of the leading experts on the Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970. I have found him to be extremely willing to listen to all sides of what are complex issues, to work in a bipartisan manner and to engage all interested parties in a constructive dialogue on OSHA related issues. I also commend him for recognizing the need which this legislation will address and for working with all interested parties over the past few weeks to draft a bill that will address that need. 
Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is really rather simple. It will make the Occupational Health and Safety Act applicable to the United States Postal Service as it would be to any other private sector employer. The reasons for doing this, and the need to do so, are very obvious to anyone who looks at this issue. A comparison of all of the worker's compensation costs charged to federal employing agencies from July 1, 1993 to July 30, 1994 showed the Postal Service had a significantly higher rate of employment based injury claims than any federal agency. There are numerous reports of safety and health problems that have gone unaddressed by the P.O., some of which have been laid out by Senator Enzi this morning. Unfortunately, unlike every other private sector employee in America, Postal Service workers do not have the benefit, or the protections of the OSHA Act. While the Postal Service has some internal mechanisms for addressing employee injuries most would find these to be inadequate to protect employees and to help the Postal Service provide a safer workplace. This legislation should be welcomed by all who care about worker safety and health and I believe the Postal Service does care. 
As my colleagues know, the Postal Service is one of the largest U.S. employers. Over the past several years it has gone through a series of reorganizations and restructuring to improve the quality of the service it provides. I commend the Postal Service for many of these initiatives and appreciate the service it provides to the people of my state. Like Senator Enzi, I do not mean to single out the Postal Service with this legislation. However, because the Postal Service operates in essence like any other private business, I think it is appropriate to expect that it complies with the same safety and health standards as other businesses. Likewise I think Postal workers deserve the same protections afforded all other private sector workers, under the Act. 
Mr. President, I hope the Senate will work quickly to adopt this legislation this year. I see no reason why this bill should not pass quickly and overwhelmingly. 
Again Mr. President, I commend Senator Enzi for bringing this important worker safety measure before the Senate and look forward to working with him to ensure its swift passage.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I speak about the other part of this bill. The Senator from Delaware just made the point that this bill we are intending to vote on today contains two very different pieces of legislation in it. Title I is of the Iran missile proliferation sanctions. That goes on for twelve pages. Title II is the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act. That goes on for 82 pages. 
I will speak about the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act for just a few minutes. Much of what I want to say is good news. Implementation of the treaty is making important and significant progress. It has been just over a year since the treaty entered into force. As of May 14, 1998, 168 nations signed this historic treaty; 108 nations have ratified the treaty. 
This is a landmark treaty that provides us with the means to rid the planet of an entire type of lethal weapon that could threaten every one of our nations. 
The threat has already been effective in identifying nations with chemical weapons capabilities. Among the Chemical Weapons Convention states possessing chemical weapons capabilities are some of the countries we have been talking about extensively here in the rest of this debate: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Iran. I point out that China and India were among the states that previously denied having chemical weapons. So by opening their facilities to inspections required by this convention, those states were forced to demonstrate their ability to provide chemical weapons. 
There is a lot of good news that I want to allude to here, but let me point out three concerns that I have that people need to be aware of as we go forward with this debate and the vote that is intended here. 
The first of these concerns relates to the fact that the treaty requires an initial declaration of capabilities of both government and commercial entities for all states that are party to the treaty. So far, there are 28 countries, including Iran, that have failed to submit their initial declarations. The Technical Secretariat for this convention must ensure that those declarations are forthcoming, and other states' parties should take measures to ensure their compliance. 
One of the unfortunate facts I want to point out is that the United States is one of the states that is not in compliance. The U.S. Government has declared government-owned facilities related to its chemical weapons program, but we have yet to declare commercial industrial facilities required for the treaty. This is an important matter to which I hope the administration is devoting priority attention. If the treaty is to be an effective vehicle as we intend it to be, our leadership in implementation efforts will be critical to its ultimate success. 
There are two other matters I want to mention here. The first concerns section 234(f) of this treaty, of this implementing language in H.R. 2709 regarding the analysis of chemical samples that may be taken during an inspection. The provision contained in the legislation before the Senate, though perhaps desirable for our purposes, our limited purposes, could result in a circumstance that we would not want to see happen. 
Let me explain. Provisions in the treaty regarding permissible equipment to be brought in by an inspector restrict their qualitative analytical capabilities. These restrictions could quite feasibly lead to ambiguities in analysis. It could require that a sample receive additional examination. Under the treaty's provisions, the analysis should be conducted at three laboratories designated by the Technical Secretariat. Only one of those laboratories is located in the United States and the other 
two lie outside our borders. 
Section 234(f) in this implementing legislation would require that no sample taken in the United States is allowed to be examined out of our borders. So clearly we are putting in law here a provision which contravenes the terms of the treaty. It is evident to me this is a problem that needs to be addressed at some stage in some way. 
The second matter that I want to bring to people's attention is the right to refuse challenge inspections. During the early days of negotiating the Chemical Weapons Convention, members of President Reagan's team insisted that all countries must allow challenge inspections to occur at any time in any place. They did so in order to ensure that this very difficult treaty could have some real teeth in it. Unfortunately, the legislation that we have before the Senate today would give the President the power to deny a request for a challenge inspection if he determines that the inspection could pose a threat to national security interests of the United States. 
The problem with this provision is that assigning ourselves the right to refuse a challenge inspection obviously raises the prospect that others may also choose to refuse a challenge inspection, and that guts a key provision of the treaty that we intended to see enforced. 
I hope that these are matters that can be corrected. I think it is unfortunate that this legislation has come to us on the floor with these particular two provisions in it. I hope very much that we can find some solution to this either in future legislation or in some action by the administration. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is a very important treaty that we have entered into. We have every reason to want to see it be effective. These two provisions that I have pointed to undermine the effectiveness of it and also undermine our credibility in trying to urge other states to comply with the treaty. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this weekend, Americans from all walks of life turn their thoughts to those men and women who died in the service of our nation. From the early heroes of the Revolutionary War through those who fought and died in the Persian Gulf, about 1.1 million Americans have sacrificed their lives to preserve our precious freedom and to meet our commitments to allies around the globe. We are privileged to enjoy the benefits of the ultimate sacrifice that those men and women in our Armed Forces made on our behalf. We take this day to honor their memory and offer our deepest gratitude. 
I remember when I was a young man, hearing those stirring words of President John Kennedy when he said, `Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.' Those words rang loud and clear in the hearts and minds of my generation. They captured our spirit and renewed our commitment to serve America. 
Perhaps the noblest heroes of my generation were those who, in the midst of the great debate over Vietnam, stepped forward to serve their country and paid the ultimate sacrifice. Those sacrifices were borne from the same spirit that John Kennedy urged upon all of us in 1961. Regardless of political persuasions, none could argue that those who died in Southeast Asia were not among America's finest men and women. We salute them today, and will always remember and be grateful for their patriotism and sacrifice. 
Those brave men and women who died in Vietnam, however, were not unique in American history. The legacy of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism has a long history in this country. During this century some 33,651 Americans lost their lives in Korea, 417,316 died during World War II, and 117,708 perished during the First World War. Almost 500,000 Americans--both North and South--lost their lives fighting for the America they believed in during the Civil War. We owe each and every one of those veterans and their families a debt of gratitude. 
I hope that every New Mexican and every American will take time this Memorial Day to find a quiet moment to consider the enormity of what our fallen friends and families have bequeathed us. This nation is blessed beyond all others---providing us with a political system that guarantees each of us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are free to speak our minds. We are free to practice our faiths. We are free to travel this great land and be with whomever we choose. These precious gifts of freedom have not come free. They have endured through the blood of American heroes and heroines. We pause this day to say `thank you.' We won't forget.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I joined the majority of my Senate colleagues in voting overwhelmingly in favor of the resolution approving the accession to NATO of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I believe that these three countries have made remarkable progress in establishing democratic institutions and undertaking fundamental economic reforms. In addition, for the United States to refuse their admission into NATO at this stage would undermine U.S. leadership both in the Atlantic Alliance and globally. 
However, my support for the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO should not be interpreted as a green light for further rounds of NATO enlargement. I believe that there is no mandate for further rounds of NATO enlargement. As the forty-one votes in support of the Warner Amendment indicate, more than enough Senators are concerned about moving too fast on NATO enlargement to block approval of the accession of any additional states to NATO in the near-term. In addition, provisions of the NATO resolution makes clear that the Senate expects to be closely consulted prior to any future negotiations on inviting other countries to join NATO. 
We must get answers to critical questions before we even begin to consider whether additional countries should be invited to join NATO. Before any further enlargement is contemplated, the United States needs to know the costs of the first several years of integrating Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO, and the burden sharing arrangements for meeting those costs. In addition, the Alliance must first complete revising and updating its Strategic Concept, the statement of NATO's fundamental military mission. This will allow NATO members, and countries potentially seeking membership, to judge for themselves whether further expansion strengthens--or undermines--the Alliance's ability to carry out its strategic mission. 
I continue to have serious doubts about the wisdom of any further enlargement of NATO. In rushing to bring the states of the former Warsaw Pact and the former Soviet Union into the NATO military fold, we risk undermining our ability to work with Russia to reduce the most immediate threats to our security. In particular, I am concerned about the adverse impact that the consideration of the Baltic states for NATO membership might have on on-going U.S.-Russian cooperative initiatives. These initiatives address some of our highest security concerns, including the containment of the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological technology and materials, and achieving mutual reductions in strategic nuclear forces. With regard to the Baltics, I draw the attention of my colleagues to a colloquy between Sen. Biden and myself recorded in the Congressional Record of April 30th, on page S3888. This colloquy clarifies that the United States has not pre-committed, either in the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership or elsewhere, to support NATO membership for the Baltic states. 
I hope now we can put the distraction of NATO enlargement behind us. It has yet to be explained how the expansion of a military alliance, formed during the height of the Cold War to defend its members' territory from external attack, serves our needs in today's changed security environment. The threats we face today require careful consideration of a full range of options--whether NATO, the Partnership for Peace initiative between NATO and 28 countries of Europe and the former Soviet Union, or other collective security arrangements--to increase the security and stability of all democratic states. 
The Senate, as well, needs to turn its attention to efforts that mutually enhance the security of the United States, its NATO allies, and the states of Eastern Europe, including Russia. These include laying the groundwork for Senate approval of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, supporting the elimination of Russian strategic arms under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, and encouraging acceleration of the START process to further reduce Russian nuclear weapons. In the long-run these initiatives offer valuable alternatives to NATO enlargement for addressing the highest security concerns in today's post-Cold War security environment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998. In line with the clear bipartisan support for Defense research I am very pleased to be joined by Senator Santorum and Lieberman in introducing this important bill. 
The National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 will lay the fiscal framework for the Defense research needed to achieve, early in the next century, what the Department of Defense call `Full Spectrum Dominance'--the ability of our armed forces to dominate potential adversaries in any conceivable military operation, from humanitarian operations through the highest intensity conflict. The bill creates a plan that would achieve the equivalent of at least a $9 billion Defense Science and Technology Program budget in today's dollars within the next 10 years--an increase of 16% over today. The bill also sets similar increases for the non-proliferation research of the Department of Energy. 
Much of the technology that gave the United States a quick victory with so few casualties in Desert Storm came from DoD's research of the 1960s and 1970s. More Defense research is needed today to prepare for the next century for a number of reasons. 
First, as the DoD has noted, the two key enablers of `Full Spectrum Dominance' will be information superiority and technological innovation. The DoD has been the preeminent federal agency funding the disciplines undergirding these enablers, for example, supporting roughly 80% of the federally sponsored research in electrical engineering, and 50% of that in computer science and mathematics. No other organizations, public or private, can be expected to substitute for the unique role of the DoD in these research areas. Second, the global spread of advanced technology and a nascent revolution in military affairs are creating new threats to the United States which will challenge our ability to achieve Full Spectrum Dominance. These include: information warfare; cheap precise cruise missiles; and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Finally, we are now in a relatively secure interlude in our international relations, a time when we can afford to work on transforming our military forces. While the world is still a dangerous place, it will be even more dangerous in the future. So now is the time to undertake the Defense research needed to secure our future. 
Yet, the DoD's current Science and Technology budget plans do not reflect these realities. The outyear budgets are basically flat in real terms out to 2003, at a level $200 million lower than 1998's level. This money pays for the research and concept experimentation needed to invent and experiment with new military capabilities. Worse yet, the Department of Energy's budget for non-proliferation research will decline by around 20% in real terms by 2003. Simply put, Mr. President, these budget plans are just not consistent with the vision of Full Spectrum Dominance, the threats on the horizon, and the opportunity we have today. 
National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act creates budget plans that are consistent with the vision, threats, and opportunity. Starting with fiscal year 2000, the Act calls on the Secretary of Defense to increase the Defense Science and Technology budget request by at least 2% a year over inflation until fiscal year 2008. The end result will be a Defense Science and Technology budget that reaches at least $9 billion in today's dollars by 2008, an increase of $1.2 billion or 16% over today's level. The Department of Energy's non-proliferation research would also increase the same 2% over inflation yearly. 
These budget increases are significant for research, yet modest and achievable; they will be an excellent investment. While they may require some shifting of funds within DoD's budget, the total amount shifted will be around half a percent of that total budget over ten years. I am extremely confident that the Secretary of Defense will be able to make this gradual shift in the budget without damaging other priorities. I am also quite sure its something we need to do. 
Imagine, if you will, a large company in the most ferociously competitive high tech business in the world--a company that has done very well over the years, but faces downstream a series of new, highly aggressive, innovative and unpredictable competitors. Would we, as shareholders, say that shifting half a percent of its revenue into research over ten years would be something it couldn't afford to do? No. It would be clear that is something it couldn't afford not to do. I suggest the DoD is in a similar position. 
Technological supremacy has been a keystone of America's security strategy since World War II. Supporting that supremacy has been Defense research, one of the highest return investments this nation makes. This coming decade is the time to start increasing this investment in our national security. The National Defense Science and Technology Investment Act of 1998 is a modest approach to making this investment, but one, I am sure, which will yield immodest returns to our military. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Santorum, Lieberman, and myself in support of this important bill. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Levin in expressing my opposition to Senate bill 1873, the American Missile Protection Act. The policy expressed in this bill of putting the United States in a position where we are required to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it is technologically possible I think is a major mistake and undermines our long-term security. We are rushing prematurely--if this legislation becomes law, we will be rushing prematurely to deploy a national missile defense system where that is not necessary and where it could undermine our real security interests. 
Why do I say it is not necessary? I say it is not necessary to pass this legislation because we already have in place a program to develop a national missile defense for this country. The administration is committed to the development of a national missile defense over 3 years, so that by the year 2000 the United States will be positioned to deploy an initial capability within 3 years after that, if it is warranted by the threat. We need to continue to assess this threat as we move ahead. 
The Cochran bill, which we are considering here, seeks to commit our country to deploy the first available missile defense technology, national missile defense technology, regardless of a whole variety of issues. Let me just discuss those briefly. 
The first set of issues that this bill would sidestep entirely is the issues that we have required the Pentagon to take into account in all weapons systems that we develop. We have had a long history, even in the time I have been here in the Senate, of developing weapons systems when we had not adequately considered the cost and we find out they are costing substantially more than we committed to, where we had not adequately considered the performance capability of the system and we find out the system doesn't work as we earlier hoped it would. 
And we have put in place, and we have required the Department of Defense to put in place, procedures to assure that they keep a sensible balance in the development of their weapons programs. There is a Defense Department directive, which is No. 5000.1. It sets out the Department's basic guidance on weapons system acquisition. It spells out the regulations governing procurement and states: `All programs need to strike a sensible balance among cost, schedule, and performance considerations given affordability constraints.' What we would be saying in this legislation is that none of that is required with regard to this program. That would be shortsighted and would undermine our real long-term security needs. 
The bill threatens to exacerbate the scheduling and technical risks already present in this national missile defense program. The Armed Services Committee, about a month ago, heard testimony from General Larry Welch, who is the former Chief of Staff of the Air Force. He led a panel of experts to review U.S. missile defense programs at the request of the Pentagon. That panel found that pressures to deploy systems as quickly as possible have led to very high levels of risk in the test programs of THAAD, the theater high-altitude air defense system. It is a theater missile defense system, not a national missile defense system. They pointed out the high levels of risk and failure in that program and in other missile defense systems. This confirmed similar findings in a GAO study that Senator Levin and I requested earlier. 
This Senate bill we are considering today, S. 1873, would generate the same pressures to hastily field a national missile defense system that have resulted in what General Welch referred to as the `rush to failure' in the THAAD program. That program is now 4 years behind schedule. It is still waiting for the first intercept, as was proposed when the program was designed. They have had five unsuccessful intercept tests. The most recent was yesterday in my home State of New Mexico, at White Sands Missile Range. Despite the delay in the THAAD development program of over a year since the previous test flights, they still have not been able to have a successful test. Now, national missile defense involves even more complex and technological challenges that will risk failure if we rush to deploy that system as well. What we need to do is to take the lessons General Welch is trying to teach us, by pointing to the problems in the THAAD program, and use those lessons to do better in the development of a national missile defense program. 
Secretary Cohen's letter has been referred to by Senator Levin and, of course, the position of the Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is one of these cases where the Pentagon clearly is opposed to the legislation we are considering. Yet, we, in our ultimate wisdom on the Senate floor, believe that we know better what is in the national security interests of the country than do the people in charge of implementing that national security policy. I think it is shortsighted on our part. 
Senator Levin also pointed out that not only does this legislation put us in a position where we are mandating pursuit of this program, regardless of the various factors we believe are important in developing of any system, but we are also pursuing it without adequate consideration of the arms control implications. There is no question that in this world we need to have the cooperation of the Russians in order to effectively limit proliferation of nuclear and other types of weapons of 
mass destruction. If we take action in this Congress and in this country to abrogate the ABM Treaty at this point, it is almost a certainty that the START II Treaty will not be ratified by the Duma and that our ability to continue to build down the nuclear weapons arsenals of the two countries will be substantially impeded. 
I believe it is clearly in our best interest to defeat this bill, to vote against cloture, and not to even proceed to full debate of this bill. The administration has indicated its strong opposition to the legislation, as have the Pentagon and various former members of our national security policy team. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that when the final vote comes here--I gather it will be in about 45 minutes or an hour--Senators will join in resisting the effort to move ahead with this legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today and ask my colleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family and loved ones of one of New Mexico's most outstanding citizens, L.F. `Tow' Diehm, who died last week. Mr. Diehm leaves a proud and indelible legacy for his family, profession, and community. He spent his professional life dedicated to athletics in New Mexico, and while he will be missed, his reputation will live on. 
Tow came to the University of New Mexico in 1957 and held the job of athletic trainer for 31 years. As friends and family will attest, Tow was a man who never forgot that the young student athletes in his charge were people. Throughout his 31 years, not a day went by when Tow did not touch the lives of the people around him. As a gesture to Tow of respect and affection, the University of New Mexico named its new athletic complex after him when it was completed in 1997. Indeed, the honors that were bestowed on Tow throughout his life were numerous: he is a member of the University of New Mexico Athletic Hall of Honor, the Helms Trainers Hall of fame, and in 1980, he became the first person, who was not an athlete or a coach, ever inducted into the Albuquerque Hall of Fame. 
Whether generating funding for the athletic department or acting as a confidante to the many student athletes he helped every day, Mr. Diehm did everything in his life, personal and professional, with honor and integrity. His influence on athletes, his colleagues and friends, to say nothing of his family, is immeasurable. The standard of excellence that he embodied will live on in each life that he touched.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail. This legislation is important to New Mexico and contributes to the national dialogue on the history of this country and who we are as a people. 
In history classes across the country, children learn about the establishment of European settlements on the East Coast, and the east to west migration which occurred under the banner of Manifest Destiny. We in New Mexico, however, also know the story of the northward exploration and settlement of this country by the Spanish, a little known but important piece of America's history. 
My legislation recognizes a proud chapter in American history; the northward exploration and settlement of the Southwest by the Spanish. Building upon a network of trade routes used by the indigenous Pueblos along the Rio Grande, Spanish explorers established a migration route into the interior of the continent which they called `El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro,' the Royal Road of the Interior. My bill will amend the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail, and give the National Park Service a mandate to develop interpretive displays explaining the importance of the trail during the Spanish settlement of the southwest United States. 
This legislation is especially appropriate in this year of the Cuartocentenario, which commemorates the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the first Spanish capital at San Juan Pueblo, the first terminus of the El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. 
In 1598, almost a decade before the first English colonists landed at Jamestown, Virginia, Don Juan de OnAE6ate led a Spanish expedition which established the northern portion of El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. The road was the main route for communication and trade between the colonial Spanish capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial capitals at San Juan de Los Caballeros, San Gabriel and then Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
From 1598 to 1821 El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro facilitated the exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, religious conversion, and military occupation of the borderlands. The Spanish influence from that period can still be seen today in the ethnic and cultural traditions of the southwestern United States. 
In the 17th century, caravans of wagons and livestock struggled for months to cross the desert and bring supplies up El Camino Real to missions, mining towns and settlements in New Mexico. On one section known as the Jornada del Muerto, or Journey of Death, they traveled for 90 miles without water, shelter, or firewood. Wagons heading south carried the products of New Mexico to markets in Mexico. 
El Camino Real became an integral part of an international network of commerce between Europe, the United States, New Mexico and other provinces of the Mexican republic. The route is a symbol of the commercial exchange and cultural interaction between nations and diverse ethnic groups that led to the development of the southwestern United States. It is also a proud symbol of the contributions of Hispanic people to the development of this great country. 
As we enter the 21st century, it's essential that we embrace the diversity of people and cultures that make up our country. It is the source of our dynamism and strength. I look forward to helping to advance our understanding of our rich cultural history through this initiative.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota and compliment him on his leadership in proposing this amendment. 
Mr. President, I have expressed grave concern about this whole proposal to expand NATO. One concern that I have expressed is that it diverts our attention from our real national security threats as I see them today. This amendment by the Senator from North Dakota tries to bring us back to those real national security threats by talking about the threat that is posed by these tactical nuclear weapons. For that reason I think it is a very good amendment and one that I am very honored to cosponsor. 
Let me point out that we have had various hearings on this issue in the Armed Services Committee. There is no question but what the lack of agreement, the lack of progress, on dealing with tactical nuclear weapons is a serious concern for our military and a serious concern for our planners generally. 
This amendment is extremely modest in its language. Let me just call people's attention to specific provisions of it. 
First of all, it is a sense of the Senate. It does not have binding language in it. It essentially puts the Senate on record as favoring a certain position. 
It says: 
It is the sense of the Senate that . . . Prior to the deposit of instruments of ratification, the Administration shall certify to the Senate that with regard to non-strategic nuclear weapons

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment relates to what is called the NATO strategic concept. We have had quite a bit of discussion over the last couple of days about the NATO strategic concept and the fact that NATO countries, NATO members, including ourselves, have been engaged in serious discussions over the last year or two in an effort to revise the NATO strategic concept. 
I think we are all aware that the current strategic concept for NATO is one that was arrived at back in 1991. It predates the disillusion of the Soviet Union, and the resulting emergence of new independent states. It does not account for the Civil War in Bosnia or NATO's peacekeeping operations there. It does not allow or contemplate the current nuclear or strategic concept, does not contemplate the denuclearization of Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and it does not contemplate the special relationships that NATO has established with Russia and separately with the Ukraine. So there is clearly a need to revise and update this strategic concept. 
What my amendment says very simply is that the United States will withhold consent to inviting any additional countries other than the three we are talking about here today--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. We will not go forward with inviting any additional countries to join NATO until after NATO has approved this revised strategic concept. 
This is simply a matter of understanding what NATO is doing before we agree to take in more members in addition to these three. NATO members need to decide on the alliance's mission before any new candidates or states are asked to join in the future. 
I have great difficulty seeing why anyone would object to this. The reality is that the revised concept is expected to be completed even as soon as this summer. At the very latest it would be complete, as I understand it based on the statements by the NATO officials, before their meeting in 1999. So there is no attempt here to delay the invitation to other members in the future. 
It simply says let's figure out what NATO is intended to do in this new post-cold-war world before we start inviting more people to join. Now, this doesn't strike me as a radical proposal. It is not radical from our point of view. It is certainly not radical from the point of view of potential new members. If I were representing a country that was considering admission to NATO I would be interested in what NATO's mission is, its new revised strategic concept is, before I would want to sign up. I think that is a reasonable thing for new members to want to know, and it is certainly reasonable for current members to want to settle on before we begin deciding which nations are appropriate new members and which are not. I think the amendment is very straightforward. 
Let me make it crystal clear once more. It does not in any way relate to the enlargement of NATO to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. That is not part of my amendment. My amendment assumes we will go ahead with the enlargement of NATO that is presently proposed by the administration in this treaty. But it says we will not go beyond that. We will not invite others until we settle on what this revised strategic concept is. 
I have difficulty understanding, as I said, why this is objectionable. It seems to me imminently reasonable that this would be our position. 
Let me make it crystal clear what I am doing. Let me read the one paragraph of the amendment into the record so it is clear what we are saying. 
Prior to the date of deposit of the United States instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to the Senate that, until such time as the North Atlantic Council agrees on a revised strategic concept of NATO, it is the policy of the United States not to support the accession to the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the invitation to begin accession talks with any European state, other than Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
Basically, what we would be saying is the President needs to tell us that it is our policy, the U.S. Government policy, not to invite others to join until we get the strategic concept settled. 
I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment. To me, it is an imminently reasonable, common-sense approach and I hope we can add it to the treaty. 
I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just make clear what I intend by this amendment and what I think the language of it says. As much as I like to think that the U.S. Senate is all powerful, we are, in NATO, only one of the members. NATO is an entire organization. The United States and the other members have set about to develop this revised strategic concept. 
As I understand the history of this, in July of last year, in Madrid, there was agreed upon--NATO Ministers agreed at that time to develop a revised strategic concept, which would be presented to them in their planned summit of April of 1999. 
What my amendment says is that until such time as the North Atlantic Council agrees on a revised strategic concept, whatever it is, for NATO, then we will not go ahead. At least the U.S. position is that we should not go ahead and participate in inviting new members. So I am talking about a very formal procedure here which is well underway. It was agreed to in July of last year in Madrid. 
As I understand it, it is a three-stage process for conducting the review of the strategic concept. That three-stage process is well underway. There is no indication that I have seen that these deadlines will not be met. In fact, I have heard from people in the administration that they expect the revised strategic concept to be ready this summer, not in April of next year. So all I am saying is, let's figure out what NATO's purposes are and what its mission is before we take on additional members after we do these three. 
So this is not an effort to delay, this is not an effort to postpone for 3 years, or 5 years, or indefinitely. I say, quite frankly, if we don't have agreement among the Council members, the Ministers of NATO, as to what the mission of NATO is, if we can't get agreement in the next period of time, then we should have it come back to us, and we ought to start thinking about how much more enlargement we want to do. That is the purpose of the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I assume that part of what is being considered in this review of the strategic concept is the role that nuclear weapons would play in the future of NATO, where those weapons might be stationed, what the policy of NATO would be in the use of weapons. All of these are factors that I think would be very important for new members to know before they apply for membership and would be important for us to know before we agree to expand and expand and expand. Every time a member comes into NATO, we are committing U.S. forces to defend that territory. I understand that. I think it is just appropriate that we have some caution in committing U.S. forces to defend more and more and more territory, and that is the purpose of the amendment--just to understand where we are before we keep moving ahead.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the members of NATO are engaged today in revising and updating the so-called strategic concept of NATO. We are part of this ongoing review. It was agreed to in July of last year in Madrid, by the Council, that this revision of the strategic concept would take place, and they set out a three-stage process to do it. They are well into that process now. The idea behind it was that the new, revised strategic concept will be presented next April at the Ministers meeting. 
My amendment says that after the admission of Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic, it will be the policy of the United States not to invite other members to come into NATO until that revised strategic concept has been agreed to by the Council, by the NATO Council. To my mind, this is not a radical proposal in any respect. It is exactly the process that is intended to take place. It is very important, I believe, for ourselves to know what the new mission is and to have agreement on what the new strategic concept is before we take on new members and commit to defend their territory. Of course, I think it is also very important that the new members who would like to become part of NATO understand precisely what this strategic concept is before they sign on to participate in it. 
So that is the amendment. There is no great mystery about it. It is not intended to subvert anything, to delay anything. It has absolutely no effect on the question of whether Poland and the Czech Republic and Hungary should be admitted into NATO at this time. But it does say before we go beyond that, we should get this strategic concept agreed to. It is intended that that happen next year. I have every reason to believe it will happen next year. It is important that it happen before we begin to invite others to join NATO after these three countries. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me just sum up my position. I do not 
think the amendment by the Senator from Arizona is related to this. That is a statement by the U.S. Senate as to what we think ought to be in the revised strategic concept. It is not a statement by the Council, NATO Council, as to what ought to be in there. I think it is important that we get agreement among our NATO allies as to what is in this strategic concept before we go ahead to invite new members. That is what my amendment says. 
Unless someone intends that we invite new members in the next 11 months, there is no delay involved in this. So I hope very much my colleagues will approve the amendment and add it to the treaty. 
I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. I have voiced a number of concerns with regard to the Administration's open-door policy on NATO enlargement, and in particular the implementation of that policy with regard to the Baltic states. 
Over the last few days, the Administration and Sen. Biden and his staff have worked closely with myself and my staff to address my concerns. 
I wish to confirm with Sen. Biden and Sen. Helms that my understanding of certain provisions in the NATO resolution, as modified by the Manager's Amendment, is correct. 
First, there is the issue of consultations with the Senate. I understand that the Resolution, as clarified by the Manager's Amendment, states that the Senate will be consulted prior to the U.S. consenting to invite any European state to begin accession talks with NATO, as was done for Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic at Madrid last year. This would apply for the Baltic states, and for any other European state seeking admission to NATO. Is that correct?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Second is the issue of U.S. security commitments. The NATO resolution contains a provision stating that only `a consensus decision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the national procedures of each NATO member * * * will constitute a security commitment pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty.' This means that a political document, like the Baltic Charter, which has not been approved by the Senate pursuant to constitutional treaty-making process, does not constitute a U.S. security commitment to the Baltic states. Is my understanding of that provision correct?

Mr. BINGAMAN. The third concern that I wish to address is whether the United States, in signing the Baltic charter, has `pre-committed' to support Baltic membership in NATO in the future. The Resolution, as modified, contains a provision to the effect that, other than Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, the United States has not consented or committed to invite any other country to join NATO in the future. My understanding of this provision is that it reflects the fact that the Baltic Charter of Partnership does not constitute a U.S. pre-commitment to NATO membership for the Baltics, and that presently the United States has not consented or committed to support NATO membership for any European state (other than Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic) that may seek to accede to NATO. Is that understanding correct?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to co-sponsor this important legislation introduced by my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch. The bill authorizes the construction of an interpretive visitor center at the Four Corners Monument. As I am sure all senators know, the Four Corners is the only place in America where the boundaries of four states meet in one spot. The monument is located on the Navajo and Ute Mountain Ute Reservations and operated as a Tribal Park. Nearly a quarter of a million people visit this unique site every year. However, currently there are no facilities for tourists at the park and nothing that explains the very special features of the Four Corners region. The bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to contribute $2 million toward the construction of a much needed interpretive center for visitors. 
Mr. President, the Four Corners Monument is more than a geographic curiosity. It also serves as a focal point for some of the most beautiful landscape and significant cultural attractions in our country. An interpretive center will help visitors appreciate the many special features of the region. For example, within a short distance of the monument are the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, Colorado; the Red Rock and Natural Bridges areas of Utah; and in Arizona, Monument Valley and Canyon de Chelly. The beautiful San Juan River, one of the top trout streams in the Southwest, flows through Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. 
In my state of New Mexico, both the legendary mountain known as Shiprock and the Chaco Canyon Culture National Historical Park are a short distance from the Four Corners. 
Mr. President, Shiprock is one of the best known and most beautiful landmarks in New Mexico. The giant volcanic monolith rises nearly 2,000 feet straight up from the surrounding plain. Ancient legend tells us the mountain was created when a giant bird settled to earth and turned to stone. In the Navajo language, the mountain is named Tse' bi t'ai or the Winged Rock. Early Anglo settlers saw the mountain's soaring spires and thought they resembled the sails of a huge ship, so they named it Shiprock. 
The Four Corners is also the site of Chaco Canyon. Chaco was an important Anasazi cultural center from about 900 through 1130 A.D. Pre-Columbian civilization in the Southwest reached its greatest development there. The massive stone ruins, containing hundreds of rooms, attest to Chaco's cultural importance. As many as 7,000 people may have lived at Chaco at one time. Some of the structures are thought to house ancient astronomical observatories to mark the passage of the seasons. The discovery of jewelry from Mexico and California and a vast network of roads is evidence of the advanced trading carried on at Chaco. Perhaps, the most spectacular accomplishment at Chaco was in architecture. Pueblo Bonito, the largest structure, contains more than 800 rooms and 32 kivas. Some parts are more than five stories high. The masonry work is truly exquisite. Stones were so finely worked and fitted together that no mortar was needed. Remarkably all this was accomplished without metal tools or the wheel. 
Mr. President, 1999 marks the centennial year of the first monument at the Four Corners. An interpretive center is urgently needed today to showcase the history, culture, and scenery of this very special place. New facilities at the monument will attract visitors and help stimulate economic development throughout the region. I am pleased to co-sponsor this bill with Senator Hatch, and I thank him for his efforts.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express serious concerns about this proposal to enlarge NATO. The question of whether we admit Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO needs to be judged in the overall context of our security needs in this post-cold war period. Today's security environment is uncertain and vastly different from the climate of the cold war for which the NATO alliance was created. New threats dominate our national security agenda. The new threats are well known to all of us. They are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and regional instability created by rogue states in the Middle East or northeast Asia, the specter of accidental nuclear launch and other high priority military threats. Those are the immediate security concerns which we have. 
Yet, when I look at the national security threats that we have, it does not strike me that enlarging NATO is likely to help us meet those threats. An important distinction was made by Dr. Kissinger, a former Secretary of State and National Security Adviser, between the role of a military alliance and a collective security system. Dr. Kissinger--who, by the way, is a supporter of NATO enlargement--stressed that NATO is a military alliance which is established for the purpose of defending a specified area. In contrast, a collective security system or agreement is formed in response to aggression on a case-by-case basis. It does not maintain forces of its own and it is not restricted to defending a particular geographical area. 
We need to ask ourselves which of these two types of organizations enhances our security more: Expanding a military alliance that was formed to defend the territory of its members against a Soviet threat that no longer exists--that is one option which is the one before us, unfortunately--or, on the contrary, pursuing collective security arrangements designed to meet today's threats. 
I am concerned that this near-sighted emphasis on NATO enlargement may increase rather than decrease our threat to security interest in Europe. At best, NATO enlargement is a distraction in that it diverts our attention from other higher priority concerns and alternative solutions, and, at worst, it could undermine our ability to address these more immediate priority military threats and perhaps reduce the cohesiveness of the NATO alliance upon which we have depended. 
Which one it results in will largely depend on how we address the long-term risks of NATO enlargement, how this open-ended process becomes limited, and what its impact is upon the cooperative efforts between the U.S. and Russia to enhance our security mutually, the security of the U.S. and of Russia, in the spirit of partnership. 
If we proceed with NATO enlargement, we must ensure that we do not erode our ability to meet our highest priority security concerns or preclude alternative collective security arrangements that may more effectively address these concerns. 
Mr. President, I am considering introducing several amendments to the Senate resolution on the protocols regarding the accession of Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic. These amendments are intended to safeguard against some of the potential long-term risks associated with NATO enlargement. 
First, let me express support for Senator Warner's amendment to establish a 3-year moratorium on further rounds of NATO enlargement. I am an original cosponsor of that amendment. NATO membership for Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic cannot be separated from the larger issue of the administration's seemingly open-door policy for enlarging NATO. 
According to the administration, any state of Central or Eastern Europe that meets certain democratic criteria is a potential candidate for NATO membership. Altogether there are nearly a dozen countries that are or may be candidates for NATO membership in the coming years. Included in that group are the three Baltic States, Slovenia, Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Macedonia. 
I support the goal of integrating Central and Eastern Europe into a united and democratic Europe free of the divisive legacy of the cold war. But the question is, how do we achieve that goal? In this regard I have some serious concerns about the administration's open-door policy on enlarging NATO. 
There are some fundamental questions that remain unanswered. We do not know whether these three candidate countries, the three we are considering in this resolution, are militarily and economically prepared to contribute to NATO's common defense. 
As several of the speakers this afternoon have mentioned, cost estimates for enlargement vary widely. The burdensharing arrangements within NATO are still unresolved. NATO itself is still revising its post-cold war strategic mission. 
At a minimum, I believe we in the Senate, if we proceed with expanding the Atlantic alliance, it is in America's and NATO's interest to take the time to fully assess the effects, both the costs and the benefits, of this round of expansion. A 3-year pause, as suggested in Senator Warner's amendment, would give alliance members a reasonable time to do this. If things go according to NATO's plan, then alliance members, both the new ones and the old ones, will have updated NATO's strategic military mission well within that time frame. A pause would allow cost-sharing arrangements to be reached and payments to be received. 
Let me turn to a few other issues that I intend to deal with by proposed amendment, Mr. President. 
Currently, the NATO resolution contains language intended to require the President to consult the Senate prior to consenting to invite any additional states to join NATO. I commend the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for including that provision. It ensures that the Senate will be a partner in any decision to invite a state to begin accession talks with NATO. 
We should have had such a provision in place before we got to this situation with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. But I intend to introduce an amendment that I believe complements and strengthens the provision that is now coming to the Senate floor. This amendment would require the President to report to Congress on the qualifications of any country being considered for NATO membership prior to the United States consenting to invite that country to begin accession talks with NATO as was done with Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in Madrid last year. 
The amendment further specifies the kind of detailed information to be provided, including each potential candidate's military preparedness to join NATO, the costs and burdensharing arrangements for integrating each potential candidate into NATO, and the impact that admitting each potential candidate would have on NATO's cohesiveness and other priority U.S. security concerns. 
The second issue that I believe needs to be addressed by amendment relates to the strategic mission of NATO. Right now we in the Senate are being called upon to sign up to a policy of 
enlarging the alliance without a clear, coherent explanation of how expansion of NATO will serve NATO's strategic interests. I am concerned because NATO itself does not seem to have an agreed upon strategic military mission. 
For several months now, NATO members have been engaged in updating the alliance strategic concept. The current concept, which was last revised in 1991, is outdated, and all agree on that. It fails to take account of such critical events as the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO'S peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, or more recently the special relationships that NATO has established with Russia and the Ukraine. 
NATO is currently debating administration proposals to expand the alliance's military charter to include operations in the Middle East and North Africa, a subject of considerable controversy for existing and prospective members alike. The alliance will also be reviewing its critically important nuclear policies. The updated strategic concept will not be completed by the time the Senate is expected to vote on this round of enlargement. 
My amendment would withhold inviting additional countries other than Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for NATO membership until after NATO has approved a revised strategic concept. This is simply a matter of setting our priorities. NATO members need to decide on the alliance's mission before any new candidates are asked to join. Future candidates need to know what obligations they would be undertaking in seeking NATO membership. 
This should not cause a delay for anyone. The expectation is that this revised strategic concept will be completed this summer. 
Once a revised Strategic Concept is agreed, existing and prospective NATO members will be able to judge for themselves whether further expansion will in the long-run strengthen--or undermine--NATO's effectiveness in fulfilling its mission. 
The third issue that I believe needs to be addressed before we conclude action on this proposed ratification of this treaty relates to the critical question of NATO membership for the Baltic States. The administration has repeatedly welcomed the aspiration of the Baltic States--Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia--to join NATO, most recently in signing a charter of partnership with those states this past January. 
At the same time the administration tells us that this charter is neither a precommitment by the United States to NATO membership for the Baltic States, nor is it a backdoor U.S. security commitment to those states. I believe it is critical that we be clear on the Senate's understanding of the Baltic Charter for the record. I am considering an amendment stating that the Baltic Charter neither precommits the United States to Baltic membership in NATO nor provides those states with U.S. security commitments. 
In addition, the NATO resolution must also be clear that it is essential for the administration to consult with the Senate well in advance of any vote in the North Atlantic Council to invite a Baltic state to begin accession talks with NATO. 
Our military commitments must be tailored to our national security priorities. An open-door policy for enlarging NATO will mean further expanding U.S. security commitments. At the heart of NATO is the mutual commitment under article V of the North Atlantic Treaty to the common defense of all NATO members in the case of attack. Since the end of the cold war, even as our armed forces have been reduced by a third, our security commitments have extended to Bosnia and Iraq and Northeast Asia and other hot spots around the globe. 
As we consider setting an open-ended course for expanding our military commitments, we must keep in mind that our defense resources are limited. I question whether we are prepared to allocate limited defense resources to ever-expanding NATO military commitments ahead of our other defense priorities, priorities such as force modernization, readiness, or investment in research and development needed to preserve our technological edge. 
I am particularly concerned about U.S. and NATO preparedness to meet these article V commitments if the Baltic States are invited to join NATO. 
If the United States and its allies are not prepared to meet our article V commitments to the common defense of all NATO members, then expansion could create alliance-threatening divisions within NATO. 
Mr. President, I do not propose to preclude the possibility of Baltic membership in NATO sometime in the future. But any invitation to the Baltic States would be a serious step that should first be thoroughly considered with the Senate's participation. In any case, Senate consent to ratification of the current protocols for Poland and Hungary and the Czech Republic should in no way be interpreted as a preapproval of the Baltic States candidacy for NATO membership. 
One final issue I want to raise today concerns continued U.S. support for the enhancement of NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. Some have argued that if the Senate does not go along with NATO enlargement, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will be abandoned in `strategic ambiguity,' exiled to a no-man's-land between NATO and Russia. I do not accept this view. An alternative already exists in NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. In this initiative, there are 28 partner countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including Russia, associating themselves with NATO. This initiative is an essential element to current and future peace and security in Europe extending to central Asia. 
Experts on both sides of this NATO enlargement issue agree on the need for a strong Partnership for Peace. Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, an advocate of NATO enlargement, testified before the Armed Services Committee on this very need to ensure that the Partnership for Peace initiative is not undermined in the process of expanding the alliance. He stated, `The Partnership for Peace should receive attention comparable to that accorded to enlargement. The experience of PFP membership should closely resemble the experience of NATO partnership.' 
So the amendment that I intend to offer on this issue would be a declaration of support for the Partnership for Peace intended to place the NATO resolution in an important context; that is, the complementary effectiveness of the Partnership for Peace initiative. 
This amendment would declare that PFP is both an essential and enduring complement to the NATO alliance in maintaining and enhancing regional security. It would also endorse NATO efforts to enhance PFP, to strengthen its political consultative mechanism through the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, to expand the operational role of the PFP, and to provide for increased participation of Partner countries in decision-making and planning within PFP. Many of these objectives are the same ones voiced in favor of NATO enlargement. 
I am concerned about contentions that the whole purpose of PFP is to prepare Partner countries for future NATO membership. For a significant number of PFP Partners, that simply isn't their primary purpose in participating. It is essential that PFP continue to be valued as an independent component of the European security system and not be reduced or constrained to being a prelude to NATO membership. Accordingly, my amendment would also clarify that PFP membership does not in any way prejudice a country's application or consideration for admission to the NATO alliance. 
I would note that, in contrast to NATO enlargement, Russian reaction to PFP is increasingly positive. While it has been a PFP Partner since the initiative began in 1994, Russia is now completing its first-ever Individual Partnership Plan, detailing the specific activities in which it intends to participate over the next few years. These include eleven PFP exercises, including one on its own territory. 
In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to consider carefully the long-term risks associated with NATO enlargement. The Senate must be an active partner in any future decision to invite further rounds of candidates for NATO membership. 
In the meantime, we need to focus our efforts on meeting our top military security priorities. We must ensure that NATO enlargement does not undermine our ability to address our most pressing security concerns. But I believe we should reserve higher priority for our cooperative efforts with Russia to eliminate strategic nuclear weapons under START I, to secure Duma ratification of START II, and to advance discussions on further reductions of nuclear weapons under a START III framework. The cooperation between the national laboratories in my state of New Mexico and their counterparts in Russia remains critically important to the pressing problem of nonproliferation. In addition, the United States needs to engage Russia in a dialogue on additional joint steps beyond START to reduce the nuclear threat. 
In summary, our primary security goal must be to promote a safe and stable security environment for the United States, our NATO allies, and the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, including Russia. No further enlargement of NATO should be considered unless and until it can be clearly demonstrated that such a step serves this goal. We need to proceed cautiously, with clear priorities and thorough consideration of all options--whether NATO, the Partnership for Peace, or other security arrangements--for promoting the security and safety of the North Atlantic area as a whole.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I feel very honored today to rise with my colleague, Senator Domenici, to introduce legislation to honor Representative Steven H. Schiff, who died last month. This bill names the Auditorium in the Technology Transfer Center at Sandia National Laboratories as the Steven H. Schiff Auditorium. I have visited Sandia's Technology Transfer Center (TTC) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It is a beautiful building dedicated to furthering collaborations between the fine staff of scientists and engineers at Sandia and their counterparts in American universities and industry. 
It is altogether fitting that we dedicate the TTC Auditorium to the memory of Steven Schiff. Steve was a strong champion of collaborations and making the resources of our national laboratories available to US industry to help us compete in the global economy. 
Mr. President, Sandia National Laboratories has 6,000 employees. The lab is one of the nation's premier national security facilities with major responsibilities for our nation's energy research and development projects. Part of Sandia's mission includes technology transfer. The emphasis is on partnerships between industry and the lab to collaborate on emerging new technologies. 
Today, Sandia's vast technical expertise is being applied to solve a variety of technical problems that will benefit working Americans. A number of exciting collaborations between Sandia's engineers and private industry have come about as a direct result of Steve's efforts. Some of these collaborations include projects to improve microelectronics and computers, airline and airport safety, lightweight materials for automobiles, robots for advanced manufacturing, and automobile tires that are safer and provide consumers better fuel economy. Madam President, I could go on and on. 
Perhaps the one area of Sandia's work that Steve was the most proud of was the lab's application of its 20 years of experience in state-of-the-art physical security technologies to the important areas of fighting crime and terrorism. Today, Sandia's vital and highly visible programs are helping to assure the safety and security of every American. In particular, Steve's efforts were instrumental in creating a satellite facility of the National Institute of Justice at Sandia. This linkage was especially satisfying to Steve because of his leadership positions on both the House Science and Judiciary Committees. 
In a short time, Sandia's efforts for the Department of Justice and the FBI are helping to combat crime and terrorism. These programs are having a major impact on the safety and security of all Americans. These efforts are truly one of Steve Schiff's greatest legacies to New Mexico and the nation. 
I'd like to cite just a few examples of Sandia's programs for the National Institute of Justice. Because of Steve's efforts, Sandia was able to play a vital role in disarming a bomb left in the unabomber's cabin. Sandia also has a school safety and security program that has dramatically increased the safety of high school students in Belen, New Mexico. I had a chance to visit the school, and it is truly remarkable what Sandia has accomplished there. Another example of Sandia's innovative technologies is the development of a `smart gun' that can only be fired in the hands of someone authorized to use it. And Sandia is developing explosive detectors for increased airport security and new ways of detecting illegal drugs. 
Perhaps the culmination of Steve's efforts was last August, when 64 of the world's top bomb squads came to Operation Albuquerque '97 for hands-on experience with the latest science and methods for disabling terrorist bombs. 
Madam President, using our national laboratories' unique resources to save lives and protect the safety of ordinary people is surely a proper memorial for Steve Schiff. Naming the auditorium at Sandia National Laboratories in his honor is another. I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation, and I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici, for his efforts.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered on behalf of myself, Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein and Senator Chafee. What I would like to do is very briefly describe what the amendment is and then yield to my colleague from Nevada for his comments. Then I will come back and make further statements in behalf of the amendment. 
The first obvious point is that there is a serious, pervasive dropout problem in our Nation's schools. I see this in my State every day. I am sure each Senator who has visited schools in his or her State sees the same problem. Over half a million students drop out of school each year before they complete high school, and they are joining a group of almost 4 million young adults who have neither graduated nor are getting a GED in lieu of graduation. 
The second point is that dropout rates are disproportionately high among low-income and minority students. That is just a fact, which we will get into more in the discussion in the minutes ahead. 
The third point is that the cost of this dropout crisis far exceeds the cost of preventing it. There may be some who suggest that my amendment, by proposing to spend as much as $150 million a year, is going to bust the budget. I suggest that we are spending more on the problem of unemployment, on welfare, on juvenile crime, on the incarceration of the 4 million undereducated young people than we are proposing in this amendment as a solution to the problem. 
The fourth point is that there is no Federal funding targeted to help middle and high schools deal with this problem today. 
The amendment would allow over 2,000 of the schools with the highest dropout rates in each State to compete for $50,000 restructuring grants. That is what we are talking about, very small amounts of money that would help these schools to begin the restructuring process to deal with the dropout problem. 
The fifth point is that the amendment does not add a new Federal education program. Instead, it replaces an unfunded 
dropout demonstration program from the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act. 
Sixth, this amendment would provide funding to every State. It would allow local schools to determine what dropout prevention method works best for them. We are not dictating the course or the steps each school should take, but we are trying to assist them in beginning to take the steps to deal with the problem. 
Finally, reducing dropout rates needs to be a bipartisan national education goal. It was identified as such in 1989. When President Bush met with all 50 Governors in Charlottesville, it was the second education goal we identified: At least 90 percent of our students would complete high school, would graduate. We have never had a serious effort to reach that goal. It is time we did. This amendment begins to move us in that direction. 
Before I go on to any further discussion, I yield to my colleague, Senator Reid, who has been a leader on this issue.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of that time and reserve the rest so that I can use the remainder to summarize after the opponents have spoken. 
But let me just go into this a little more in depth. I appreciate the strong support of the Senator from Nevada. What this amendment tries to do is to begin to focus our attention as a nation on what I see as a very, very serious problem in our educational system. And that is the problem that many, many of our students are not ever completing their high school education, in some cases are not completing their middle school education. These students are leaving the schools in large numbers, and we as a society are having to make accommodation to the fact that we have large numbers of young uneducated people coming into the work force. 
So what we are trying to do is to begin the process of focusing attention on it, begin the process of reversing this trend. Let me show a few charts here, Mr. President, just to make the points. 
This first chart is called `Event Dropout Rates for Grades 10 through 12, Ages 15 through 24, By Race and Ethnicity.' And this is the period 1972 through October of 1995. 
You can see on this chart that for the white non-Hispanic students, although they have had the lowest annual dropout rate of any group, that dropout rate has been increasing, not decreasing, in recent years. So this is a problem that affects everybody. 
The non-Hispanic black students--that is this green line--it has been coming down somewhat. The general trend is down. But it also is quite high and is not near where it should be. 
Of course, the red line--which is the line that represents the Hispanic students in our school system--it is by far the highest of these lines and shows the seriousness of the problem. Dropout rates have not declined in recent years. This is not a problem that is fixing itself; this is a problem that needs additional attention. Dropout rates are particularly adverse among the Hispanic population. 
Let me show another chart here, Mr. President. You can see this is called `The Status Dropout Rate.' That indicates, rather than an annual rate, this is how many of our students have left school essentially before they graduate. You can see that this red line--representing the Hispanic students in our school system--it is consistently over 30 percent. We essentially are losing a third of the Hispanic students in our school system before they complete high school under the present circumstance. 
There was recently a report done called the `Hispanic Dropout Project Report, No More Excuses.' That report makes the case very convincingly that new strategies are needed, new 
efforts are needed, to deal with this problem. 
Let me show one other chart here, just because I know every Senator here is concerned about his or her State in particular. This is a listing of the dropout counts and annual rates for States by State, starting with the State with the highest dropout rate. Unfortunately--and this, I am sure, is one of the reasons that the Senator from Nevada is so concerned about this issue--Nevada, according to this, had the highest dropout rate in 1993-94. Next was Georgia, the manager's State, that had an 8.7 percent dropout rate. And third was New Mexico, my own State, with an 8 percent dropout rate. That means, every year, 8 percent of the students in the school system drop out. 
So over the period of 4 years of high school and even some part of middle school, we lose more than 30 percent in many of our schools. 
These are crucial issues in my State. I run into this problem as I go around my State talking to parents, talking to school administrators, talking to teachers, talking to the students themselves. 
It is time for the country to act. It is not enough to just say, `This can get handled by the larger issues. We don't need to make special efforts with regard to this. It will take care of itself. As the general educational system improves, maybe this problem will go away too.' That is not an adequate answer. We need to do better than that. The simple truth is that too many of our schools are not meeting the academic, the vocational, or the other needs of students. Students are leaving those schools. They are bored with the watered down, repetitive courses, and in many cases they are alienated by the very size of the schools.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just respond to a couple of points that were made by the Senator from Tennessee. He says we made huge progress. That is not what the people in my State believe. That is not what the school administrators and students and parents in my State believe. 
The Department of Education report that just came out this year indicates their conclusion is that there has been no overall progress in lowering dropout rates during the last 10 years. That is the decade during which we were supposed to be moving up to 90 percent of all of our students completing high school before they left school. 
In 1989, when the Governors and President Bush met in Charlottesville, the goal was set at 90 percent. It was 86 percent then. 
It is today 86 percent, according to the National Education Goals Panel. In the last 10 years there has been no progress, in spite of the fact that we have had this national goal. 
Another part of the goal, in addition to getting 90 percent of our students to complete high school, was to eliminate the disparity in the different groups in our society so that you didn't have such a large dropout problem among one group--in this case, the Hispanic students--and such a disparity between the problem with that group and other groups. Clearly, those disparities have not been eliminated. The problem is very much with us. It needs attention, and it is every bit as serious now as it was in 1989 when we established the national goal of getting to 90 percent. 
The Senator from Tennessee says we have too many programs already. I point out that my friend and colleague from Georgia is getting ready to offer another proposal here. We seem to have a double standard. When the proposed new programs are brought up on that side of the aisle, they are acceptable; when they are brought up on our side of the aisle, there are too many programs. The reality is that there are no programs--there is no Federal money focused on dealing with this problem of dropout prevention. That is one reason we have never dealt with it. It is not on the national agenda, it is not on the agenda of the Department of Education, and, frankly, it is not on the agenda of most of our States and school districts, and it needs to be. 
Mr. President, if we are going to make progress on this, at some stage we are going to have to quit coming up with excuses. The title of a report that came out this year was `No More Excuses.' To my mind, that sums it up well. Let's get on with dealing with this problem.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment tries to begin to focus national attention and some resources on the problem of students who drop out of school before they complete high school. 
In 1989, when President Bush and the 50 Governors met and set some national education goals for the country, one of those goals was that we would have at least 90 percent of our students complete high school before they left school. At that time, 86 percent of our students were completing high school before they left. Today, it continues to be 86 percent. We have done absolutely nothing to reach this very important national goal.

This amendment is offered on behalf of myself, Senator Reid, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Chafee. It is bipartisan. It is an important bipartisan issue. We have always before, at least since the national goal was established in 1989, found excuses to not do anything to follow up and achieve the goal. This time we need to go ahead and commit some Federal resources to help local school districts solve this problem. This amendment is a step in that direction. I hope very much that people will support the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, most of the teachers in today's public schools became educators before the era of personal computers really began and was established. To address the skills of the next generation of teachers, 32 states require a course in education technology as part of the teacher preparation curriculum. 18 states have not yet incorporated such a requirement. 
New Mexico teachers must have just one education technology course before they are certified, and some universities such as New Mexico State University and Eastern are taking the lead in integrating technology into their education school programs. Yet, the majority of New Mexico's current teachers received their training before the start of the computer era in the mid-1980's and the new regulations do not address their training needs. 
Nationwide, although 98 percent of schools are equipped with computers to some degree, 90 percent of new teachers, even after a single course, do not feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. Clearly, more skill development needs to take place to increase the comfort teachers feel with technology. 
Most of the roughly $6 million in New Mexico state and federal funding for education technology has been used to purchase and install equipment rather than to train teachers to use new technology. Tremendous resources have been invested in hardware and installing the mechanism for access to the Internet. Sixty five percent of schools nationwide have at least some connection to the Internet, yet only 13 percent of schools have Internet training for teachers, and only 20 percent of teachers say that they readily use the Internet to help with their instruction. 
With a teaching load of 80 students and an average salary of $29,600, most New Mexican teachers cannot afford to pay for their own training or take the summer off to learn how to use computers. 
Although we have seen significant progress over the last few years in Federal support for technology and the use of technology in education, the one great deficiency is the preparation teachers need to use technology effectively. This legislation will help to correct the problem by supporting educators' pursuit of training and expertise. 
I thank Senator Levin for sponsoring this legislation as an amendment to the Coverdell bill, and I'm proud to serve as a cosponsor on it.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last November, 5 months ago, we worked out a bipartisan compromise. It received 87 votes here. It called for the National Academy of Sciences to do a study about the possibility of linking various State tests and commercial tests and called on this National Assessment Governing Board, an independent board, to go ahead and develop some test questions. And essentially it set up a procedure we could look at. It also prohibited the use of any funds for field testing or pilot testing, anything in this fiscal year. 
This amendment would gut all of that, would say the National Academy needs to stop in its tracks, it cannot complete its work. It would say that the National Assessment Board has to stop what it is doing and breach its contract. 
Later this year, in the appropriations cycle, we should revisit this issue and decide at that point whether to allow field testing. But we should not be prohibiting continued study of the issue and development of questions by the National Board at this point. So I urge colleagues to oppose the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kennedy's amendment to the Coverdell bill, which would provide loan forgiveness to teachers in high need areas and subjects. Attracting well qualified teachers through the use of loan forgiveness is a terrific idea and one that I've introduced and supported in the context of the reauthorized Higher Education Act. Loan forgiveness for teachers ensures that teachers are not saddled by excessive debt during their first crucial years of teaching. 
Just two days ago, a new report from the American Federation of Teachers on teacher salaries showed that, in part due to the low unemployment and tight labor market of recent months, teacher salaries are falling behind wages for other occupations and will make it even harder for schools to find qualified candidates. 
Given all the other jobs that may be available, we as a nation have a serious problem in recruiting strong candidates for teaching. Clearly, loan forgiveness needs to be part of a comprehensive strategy to raise the quality of teachers and attract the best candidates to the classroom. 
To help attract more teachers, this amendment proposes to provide up to $8,000 in loan forgiveness to teachers in high need areas or subjects, as determined by local school districts. While I strongly support the amendment and its intention, there are two issues that are worth raising. One is that the criteria for eligibility are too broad, especially given the amount of money associated with the legislation. More importantly, however, the amendment does not address the basic issue of teacher quality outlined in the findings that preface the legislation. I believe that, in order to be qualified to teach a subject area, particularly on the secondary level, a teacher should have a major in that subject or a related field. 
According to a recently completed analysis of state-level student achievement data, states with more teachers holding full certification plus a major in their field do significantly better on National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reading and math examinations. Students of teachers who completed undergraduate academic majors and appropriate professional coursework achieve better than age peers whose teachers completed education majors, no matter how poor, what their ethnicity, or whether English is a second language. 
For these reasons, I am glad to be working with Senator Kennedy on efforts to raise the quality of teaching in our classrooms and reduce the financial burden on those who have entered this essential profession. If we expect higher standards from students, we need to provide them with teachers who have the documented content area preparation to help them meet those standards.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with Senator Lieberman expresses the sense of the Senate that the next budget submission by the President, and the next Congressional budget resolution, should reclassify all civilian research and development activities within the Federal government, now scattered among 12 separate budget functions in the Budget Resolution, into one budget function--Function 250. 
Function 250, entitled `General Science, Space, and Technology,' currently is comprised of funding for the National Science Foundation, NASA, and some R&D programs at the Department of Energy. 
The purpose of the functional analysis in the Budget Resolution is to provide the Congress with insight into important crosscutting themes in the budget. When it comes to the federal investment on R&D, though, the current functional analysis in the Budget Resolution fails. It does not facilitate any sort of cross-cutting discussion about the size and direction of Federally supported science and technology research. In fact, our current budget function structure hides more than half of the Federal investment in civilian R&D. According to data from the Office of Management and Budget, in addition to the agencies and programs currently in Function 250, 20 other civilian departments and agencies have research and development programs of consequence. My amendment would address this problem by providing more transparency to our support of Federal R&D. No funds or programs would be shifted among agencies. But the President's next budget proposal would highlight where in each agency R&D was being supported. If the President were to implement the suggestion in this amendment, I believe that it would have the following beneficial effects. 
No. 1, when all civilian R&D is placed into one budget function, it will become much easier for the Congress to examine the entire Federal R&D portfolio. Questions of balance, coverage, and emphasis within that portfolio will become easier to ask when the whole picture can be seen more easily. 
No. 2, the proposed change in my amendment will facilitate the ability of each authorizing committee to review the Federally supported R&D under its jurisdiction, as one element in preparing its views and estimates for the Budget Committee. The amendment will also allow committees such as the Committee on the Budget or the Committee on Appropriations to conduct a global review of federal R&D early in the budget/appropriations process. The National Academy of Sciences has recommended that such a global look at R&D take place annually in Congress in its 1995 report, Allocating Federal Funds for Science and Technology. The Academy stated that the `Congress should create a process that examines the entire [federal science and technology] budget before the total federal budget is disagggregated into allocations to appropriations committees and subcommittees.' This amendment would facilitate the implementation of this idea, which has broad support in the scientific and technical community. 
No. 3, placing civilian R&D at mission agencies into Function 250 will reflect the reality that all Federal research and development, regardless of sponsoring agency, is interrelated. All Federal R&D, regardless of sponsoring agency, can and does make essential contributions to the general fund of knowledge. These are realities that are well known to the scientific and technical community. In the words of former IBM Vice President Lewis Branscomb, `One cannot distinguish in any meaningful way `basic' from `applied research' by observing what a scientist is doing.' 
No. 4, placing civilian R&D at mission agencies into Function 250 will elevate the prominence of R&D supported by those agencies in future budget and policy discussions. 
I believe that this amendment will result in a valuable contribution to our institutional ability to understand and manage one of the most important parts of the Federal budget 
I urge the adoption of both amendments.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is co-sponsored by myself, Senator Gramm of Texas, and Senator Lieberman. It expresses the sense of the Senate in favor of a basic principle that is widely supported in this body. That principle is that we should seek to double the Federal investment in civilian research and development over the next 10 years. This principle is contained in legislation co-sponsored by us, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and about 10 other Senators.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I, first, say that putting together a budget resolution is a very complex, difficult process. I commend those who have worked on this, particularly my colleague from New Mexico for bringing in a budget resolution that is within the constraints of the balanced budget agreement. I think that is certainly progress and is to be commended. I am, however, troubled by many aspects of it. One aspect is that which is intended to be dealt with by this amendment by the Senator from Illinois. 
I fear this budget does not reflect the forward-looking perspective that prepares us for the world that we are facing in the 21st century. 
I do not think anyone would dispute the paramount importance of education, of research, and of a safe, healthy start for our children. The importance of those items, in my view, are not reflected in this budget. They are not given the priority they should be given in this budget. 
Let me give a few examples. In the area of education, and, of course, the Senator from Illinois was talking about this general area of education, the President has proposed at least $1.6 billion more than the Republican budget in 1999 for the budget functions that include education, training, and social services. The Republican budget does not increase Federal spending by 1 cent over last year's balanced budget amendment in that regard. 
More specifically, the President and the Senate Democrats have put forth some very significant education proposals, one of which is this amendment by the Senator from Illinois. The Republican budget does not give the same priority to those concerns. The Democratic alternative and this amendment propose to help communities to renovate and build school facilities, including BIA schools, which are very important in my home State of New Mexico. The Republican budget essentially ignores this request. The Democratic proposal provides for the hiring and training of 100,000 new teachers, which is projected to reduce the average class size in grades 1 through 3 from 22 students in a class to 18 students in a class. Again, the Republican budget ignores that proposal. 
In addition, the Republicans claim they are providing an increase of $2.5 billion over the freeze level during this 5-year period for the Individuals with Disabilities Act. It turns out that this funding does not keep pace with inflation. 
While this resolution proposes to increase money for one type of block grant, the simple fact is that spending is cut significantly overall and that means that very important programs will have to be cut. Some of those programs--we are not clear as to which ones yet, of course, since that is not specified in the resolution--but some of those might include title I for disadvantaged children, Head Start, training and technology for teachers, and teacher quality. 
The resolution also gives short shrift to child care, and again Senator Dodd from Connecticut offered an amendment that I support in that regard. 
With regard to tobacco, I am tremendously concerned that the budget as presently written precludes any meaningful consideration of programs to reduce teen smoking. While I strongly agree with the chairman of the Budget Committee that we must do something to fix our Medicare Program, I believe we do not need to do so at the expense of the current and future health needs of our children. 
I commend our colleagues for the hard work that has gone into this resolution, but I do differ with my Republican colleagues about the ways in which we allocate spending in this bill. We are entering the 21st century as a strong and vibrant and growing economy, but we will only remain that way if we invest in the future and ensure that every American has the opportunity to take advantage of that growth. The way we do this is to focus on these areas of priority--education, training, and the needs of working families. 
I hope we can adopt some amendments to this resolution that will allow us to do that more effectively. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment. Anyone familiar with New Mexico, which has an economy which is heavily dependent on production of oil from marginal wells, knows that the recent historic lows for the price of oil have posed an economic threat to families and communities as dire as any natural disaster. In this context, the concept of having the Federal government dumping nearly 20 million barrels of oil onto the market, equivalent to selling nearly 100,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the fiscal year, is ludicrous. Senator Murkowski and I worked hard to prevent the Interior Appropriations bill from selling oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the first place. We found an offset that would have worked, and that the Senate accepted, but which was dropped in conference. Today, we have a second chance to end this unwise and economically devastating sale. I fully support the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote for it.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment tries to deal, at least in part--and clearly it is only in part--with a very serious problem that has been brought to our attention, tragically, in the last few days, and that is the problem of violence in our schools. 
The occupant of the chair is painfully aware of this, as we all are, by virtue of the fact that this latest tragedy occurred in his home State of Arkansas. What we have tried to do is take provisions I have been working on in the nature of a `safe schools security act' and put those in amendment form to add to this legislation pending here today. I believe it is going to be acceptable to all Senators for us to go ahead in this manner. 
Let me explain the problem, as all of us know the problem exists. Obviously, there is no way to teach a student if a student feels threatened or if there is an unsafe condition in the school. Unfortunately, we have unsafe conditions and threatening conditions in too many of our schools today. The Department of Education recently released a study that tried to look at the incidence of school violence and school crime. The study shows that 10 percent of schools surveyed had at least one serious violent crime occur in that school during the 1996-97 school year. 
In the case of violent crimes--obviously, I am talking about murder, rape, sexual battery, suicide, physical attacks with a weapon, or robbery of a student or adult--these are the types of crimes that we know are committed throughout our society, but, clearly, we need to provide special attention to see that these crimes are not committed in our schools. 
The study went on to point out that approximately 4,000 incidents of rape and other types of sexual battery occurred in our public schools across the country during the 1996-97 school year. There were 11,000 incidents of physical attacks or fights in which weapons were used and approximately 7,000 robberies that occurred in schools in that same year. 
These statistics are frightening. They underscore a problem that I think we all know exists. One part of the solution, Mr. President--again, I emphasize that this is only part--is to make better use in our schools of security technology. We have tremendous expertise in this country on the issue of technology to improve security. 
In our own National Laboratories in New Mexico, we have spent a great deal of time and resources working on this issue. I know other institutions around the country have as well. They have learned a great deal about how to maintain security, how to reduce the possibility of crime or illegal activity in a facility. And some of those lessons--not all--can be used effectively in our schools. We need to use this expertise to try to improve the way our schools function, to try to make available to our schools the new technology that has been developed. 
Already, Sandia National Laboratory in my State has an initiative in this regard. Two years ago, Sandia began a pilot project in the Belen High School in New Mexico whereby the security experts at Sandia implemented a security regimen and installed a variety of security technology in that high school. Sandia is the first to admit that they know very little about how to run a public school, and Belen was ready to admit they lacked expertise in the subject of security. Nevertheless, the two institutions got together. Sandia and Belen High School officials changed the way the school functioned by utilizing a 
comprehensive security design and technology. 
The results have been impressive. Since this pilot project was implemented at the school, on-campus violence is down 75 percent; truancy is down 30 percent; theft of vehicles parked in the school parking lot is down 80 percent; vandalism is down 75 percent. These statistics, I think, make the point that there is information here and there are lessons here that can be learned and can be put to valuable use in our schools. 
This technology is not cheap. Our schools are already strapped for adequate resources in a variety of ways. But I believe, with the right kind of technical assistance and technology, we can help the schools to help themselves to provide safer environments for our children. 
That is the purpose of the amendment that we are offering today. I hope very much that this is accepted. We need to take advantage of the lessons we have learned in other areas to try to assist our schools as well. Mr. President, I hope that over the remainder of this Congress we can identify other initiatives that we can take to improve security in our schools in addition to this. But this is one concrete step we can take. I hope very much that my colleagues will agree to this amendment and that it can be added to this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Domenici, in expressing our grief at the loss of Steve Schiff. He is someone I became friends with when we--he and I--were both young lawyers in New Mexico, beginning our legal careers. Of course, when he became district attorney for Bernalillo County, I had the good fortune to be attorney general and worked with him very closely on many issues in those jobs. 
Steve did have the respect of the people he represented because of the good, hard, nonpolitical work that he did for them, first as district attorney and later as U.S. Representative. He was not partisan in his approach to his job. He was quick to reach across party lines. I can remember many phone calls from Steve where he would call and say, `I have a bill that we have been able to pass in the House, and I need your help in the Senate.' And I can remember many phone calls I made to him, asking for his help with legislation that I was pursuing as well. 
Steve was a person who kept clearly in mind the commitment and the job that he was sent here to do for the people of our State. He had great respect in our State and here in the Congress as well. His family deserves our condolences. We certainly send those to his wife and children. 
The State of New Mexico has lost a tremendous public servant. Senator Domenici put it well by pointing out he was, first and foremost, a public servant in the very best sense of that term. He did not see himself as a politician who was trying to put a good face on the job he was doing. Instead, he saw himself as a mechanic, working in the machine and in the engine of Government to do the right thing for the people of New Mexico and for the country. 
Steve was a good friend to many of us and a great contributor to our State and to the Nation. I join Senator Domenici in expressing our grief and our condolences to his family. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, an American hero in both wartime and peacetime passed away on March 19, 1998 in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I'd like to take a moment to honor the memory of Mr. Sidney Graybeal, one of the nation's finest patriots. Mr. Graybeal's contributions to the nation spanned six decades, from his decorated service as a B-29 pilot during World War II through his distinguished career as a public servant to more recent years when he served as a distinguished member of the Secretary of Defense's high level Defense Policy Board. His many accomplishments in the nation's service have been recognized and applauded by both sides of the political aisle. Presidents Nixon and Ford commended Mr. Graybeal during their tenures in the White House, and in 1980, President Carter awarded Mr. Graybeal the nation's highest civilian honor, the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Service. 
Mr. Graybeal will be remembered and revered for his pioneering work in arms control during the coldest years of the Cold War. His extensive experience in intelligence matters and strategic nuclear policy issues served him well during his tenure on the negotiating team that crafted the historic SALT I agreements limiting offensive and defensive strategic weapons for the first time. As a result of his trailblazing work on those agreements, Mr. Graybeal was appointed as the first commissioner on the Standing Consultative Commission (SCC)--the first official U.S.-Soviet organization established to resolve arms control compliance disputes between the two superpowers. SALT I and the SCC stand as enduring legacies of Mr. Graybeal's dedicated efforts to bring the Cold War to a successful conclusion. 
Sidney Graybeal was admired by his colleagues for his energy and dedication to the nation. He was widely known as a tough negotiator, but widely loved for his warm sense of humor and diplomatic skills. New Mexico will miss one of our finest citizens. The nation will miss his wisdom and experience as we navigate these uncharted waters of the post-Cold War era. I urge my colleagues in the Congress to join me in saluting this great American.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Frist and Kennedy and Jeffords in the introduction of legislation to reauthorize Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. I am pleased to be part of this bipartisan effort to reauthorize the programs that help shape the pool of qualified health care professionals for the United States. 
Titles VII and VIII were originally enacted to address a critical health manpower shortage and successfully served to increase the overall supply of providers. The mission of Title VII and VIII has evolved as the delivery system and needs of the population have shifted. Today, the focus of the various programs rests within three main areas. The programs are aimed to solve the shortages in rural and inner city communities. They strive to address the shortage of primary care providers and finally must correct the disparity in minority representation in the health professions. Indeed, the various programs in this legislation serve to provide a base for strengthening the health resources for this country. 
In my home state of New Mexico, 28 out of 33 counties are designated as health professional shortage areas by the federal government. I am acutely aware of how a maldistribution of health care providers can impact our citizens. Geographic access to the appropriate health care provider is an important factor in our debates on the health care system. Titles VII and VIII are noteworthy avenues to address the needs in this area. Studies have shown that if we recruit individuals from the shortage area, the likelihood is much greater that they will return to practice in the area. Additionally, if clinical training is community based in rural and underserved areas, the likelihood is also increased that upon graduation, the provider will serve in the locality in which they trained. 
Equally important for a state such as mine is the commitment to address the persistent and unmet health care need along the border between the United States and Mexico. The health education and training centers in the legislation address the community health needs and the training and educational needs of health professionals serving in these areas. The legislation also has the capacity to expand and improve the public health workforce which is a major component of addressing border health concerns. 
Mr. President, this legislation restructures the act to address the health workforce needs of our nation in a flexible, but more accountable manner. We have provided for data collection and analysis of the health workforce so that decision making for the future can be well founded and be an accurate reflection of societal needs. Additionally, this legislation affords us the opportunity to provide education and training that reflect changes in an evolving health care system. As managed care and other forces shift the delivery system from inpatient hospital care to outpatient facilities, it is necessary to respond to the shifts that this causes in the workforce. To this end, the legislation addresses the curriculum development in the areas of health promotion and disease prevention as well as long term care, home health and hospice. 
As the demographics of our population shift to an older population, we must ensure we have qualified individuals to treat the specific nature of chronic diseases associated with geriatrics. As we deal with an aging population, establishing interdisciplinary training programs that promote the role of nutritionists, physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists in geriatrics are critical. The legislation provides an avenue to address these necessary components. 
Finally, the reauthorization provides a framework to better monitor the outcomes of our efforts. It continues to afford us the opportunity to assure an appropriate number and mix of health professionals for the health needs of the country. It strengthens our commitment to address the supply, distribution, and minority representation of health professionals through both Native American and Hispanic centers of excellence. I have been committed to seeing the needs of these two populations addressed. I commend Senators Frist and Kennedy for their hard work and the work of their staff to address the various concerns raised during our hearings on this important issue. I appreciate the work done by the Hispanic caucus in the House and by the minority health profession schools as well. 
Mr. President, in closing I want to thank Senators Frist and Kennedy and Jeffords for their determination to address the need to reauthorize Title VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. I appreciate that they have worked closely with our colleagues in the House to develop companion legislation. I am committed to working with my colleagues toward expeditious consideration and passage of this bill.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to join my Senate colleagues in opposition to Senator McConnell's amendment to eliminate the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Businesses Enterprise program. This program, known as the DBE program, for years has been very successful in bringing equity and fairness into construction contracting, and I believe it should be maintained as it is. Most of all, I agree that this program does not violate the equal protections guaranteed by our Constitution, and I question the Senator from Kentucky's interpretation that it does. 
In fact, if Senator McConnell is basing his reasons for eliminating this program on our Supreme Court's decision in Adarand v. Pena, then I am confused. My reading of Adarand suggests nothing of that sort. 
While it is true that the underlying issue in Adarand was whether the Department of Transportation has infringed on Adarand's constitutional right to due process and equal protection, the issue the Court actually addressed and decided in this case was by what standard is an infringement in this context determined. In other words, how do we figure out what constitutes a violation of equal protection? Indeed, the Court reversed long-standing law, and raised the standard for justifying this program. Typically, the burden to justify the necessity and the implementation of a program that affects equal protection lays with the government. 
The Court, for the first time, determined that the standard of `strict scrutiny' should be applied in a case of this sort. Specifically, the standard of strict scrutiny requires that if the government determines to implement a program such as the DBE program, which ultimately effects an individual's constitutional right to equal protection, the government first must show a `compelling interest.' Basically, the government must have more than a very good reason for the program. Second, even if the government can show a compelling interest, the standard requires that the government show that the program is `narrowly tailored' to serve that interest. So the issue before the Supreme Court in Adarand was which standard to apply, and the Court held that the standard must be `strict scrutiny.' This is a landmark decision, because it places on the government a very tough test, a test that often is very difficult to overcome. Of critical importance here, is that the Court recognized that the standard, although very tough to meet, is not fatal in fact, it is not impossible to overcome. And I believe that is where my colleague from Kentucky has erred. 
What I understand Senator McConnell to be saying is that the Court, in holding that strict scrutiny is the standard to apply in this context, ultimately held that the DBE was unconstitutional. To the contrary. The Court simply expounded the standard for making this determination, nothing more, nothing less. 
What does this standard mean to the DBE program? It means that the Department of Transportation must show that its governmental `interest,' its important reason for having this program, is `compelling.' In this context, it requires that the government must show that there is a history of discrimination in the construction contracting industry, such that minority and women-owned businesses, although qualified for a contract, continuously are not awarded contract simply because they are minority- or woman-owned. 
Clearly, there long has been a history of discrimination in this country, and the effects of discrimination still linger. Department of Transportation can show that although minority-owned businesses are 9 percent of construction firms, they get only 5 percent of construction receipts. Additionally, DoT can show that women own one-third of all small businesses, but in 1994, for example, received only 3 percent of federal procurement contract dollars. Moreover, Department of Transportation can show that, in the wake of City of Richmond v. Croson, disadvantaged businesses have been squeezed out from contracting opportunities. Put simply, in those areas where there is no DBE program in place, minority-owned businesses received no contracts at all. So it's clear there is a wide gap in the availability of qualified minority- and women-owned contractors and the number of contracts they are in fact awarded. The government's compelling interest is to remedy discrimination, and I don't think anyone in this Congress can dispute the government has a compelling interest. 
The real issue here, however, is how the government sets out to remedy that discrimination. The Court explained that strict scrutiny requires the government must `narrowly tailor' whatever is crafted to address this problem. In other words, the program cannot be too broad, but must be designed specifically enough to remedy the discrimination without infringing on anyone else's Constitutional rights. 
That is exactly what the Department of Transportation has in the DBE program. The DBE is designed only to provide a `goal' that ten percent of contracts be awarded to disadvantaged businesses. You may ask, what is the difference between a `goal' and a `quota' or a `set-aside'? I see a clear distinction. 
A quota requires that a minimum number of construction contracts be awarded to disadvantaged business, regardless of the amount or history of discrimination that has taken place. Right or wrong, it allows no flexibility. Same is true with a set-aside. 
The Department's `goal' program, on the other hand, provides broad flexibility. I read the program to encourage contracting with disadvantaged businesses up to 10 percent of contracts. That is a very significant difference, particularly when you consider the strict considerations that DoT has built into the program. 
For instance, the program requires that the goal correspond to the availability of qualified DBE's in a given market area; it requires the goal be `race neutral'; the program cannot be for an unlimited period of time but only for as long as it takes to address any measured inequities in contracting; the goal of 10 percent is not required; and it also provides the flexibility to tailor a program to the circumstances of the locality. 
Mr. President, I am confident that the DoT's DBE program is not unconstitutional and in full accord with Adarand. But nobody has to take my word for it. I suggest they examine Adarand for its real effect. That precisely is what many very esteemed constitutional law professors did, and they conclude that this program is within constitutional parameters. Any other conclusion we should leave to our Supreme Court. 
Mr. President, I appreciate Senator McConnell's concern for all the emerging small businesses in our country, and I agree there should be fairness, equality for all. I am certain he has only the most genuine interests in mind for everyone. I have to disagree, however, that fairness and equality will prevail if the DBE program is eliminated. Given our history as a nation and the lingering effects of discrimination, I believe the DBE program is necessary. Moreover, I believe it is constitutional and should remain intact. Therefore, I will oppose the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Frist and my other colleagues in introducing the Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998. 
This legislation allows us to reauthorize key women's health research and prevention programs at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These programs represent a cross section of the current research projects at the federal level that have a direct impact on women's lives here in the United States. 
While in the last decade, interest and commitment to women's health has been heightened in the Congress, much work remains. We have taken steps to ensure that women will be included in health care research in the U.S. Prior to 1993, research in women's health was inadequate. Most of the health care studies were conducted only on Anglo men. Quite simply, research studies on men cannot be generalized to women. We know that there are gender and ethnic differences when it comes to health and illness. The time has come to further address the major causes of morbidity and mortality among women: heart disease, osteoporosis, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. 
This bill will provide the basis for looking at the research needs in the spectrum of women's health and as we go to hearings on the bill I am hopeful that additional women's health issues can be addressed. 
There is another facet to women's health research that must be considered. It is imperative that we ensure that studies are representative of all women in the United States, including African American, Hispanic, Native American and Asian women. We need research that is culturally sensitive. We must support efforts of community based outreach that allows for recruitment and retention of minority women into research and this should be a factor when projects are planned and conducted. 
Mr. President, this legislation has provisions relating to women's health research at the NIH in the disease specific issues of diethylstilbestrol (DES), osteoporosis, breast and ovarian cancer. It expands and allows for increased coordination of research activities with respect to heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in women at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. This program is critical since cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for women in the United States. 
Finally, Mr. President, I wanted to take the opportunity to specifically highlight one particular CDC program in the bill. This legislation addresses the Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research Centers Program at the CDC and will extend authorization for grants to our academic health institutions for research in the areas of health promotion and disease prevention. 
The CDC's Prevention Research Center Program is an innovative, extramural link of federal, academic, state, and community based agencies. 
For my home state of New Mexico, this CDC project has been particularly useful. In New Mexico a prevention center has been able to focus on health risks and promoting health through applied research at the community level. The project and grant have provided the opportunity to address areas often overlooked such as rural population needs and Native American and Hispanic health needs. 
In New Mexico about one of every three American Indian adults has diabetes. The demonstration project has allowed for the promotion of health lifestyles to combat the epidemic of adult onset diabetes. The project has facilitated the formation of a true partnership between the Navajo nation, nineteen pueblos in New Mexico, the New Mexico Department of Health, the University of New Mexico, and the New Mexico State Department of Education. There has been training of community health workers on disease prevention strategies most applicable to American Indian communities. This program is a model for increasing collaboration among established agencies and nontraditional community partners. It is a culturally sensitive approach that is having a direct, positive impact on the health of New Mexicans. The creative approach at CDC of a community based demonstration and application project coupled with evaluation of strategies through research is unique, successful, and should be reauthorized. 
Mr. President, in closing, I look upon this bill as the important first step to reauthorize programs at both the CDC and NIH. I look forward to working with Senator Frist on these and other issues of import to women's health.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the problem of drunk driving has been discussed here for a day or two now. It is clear to all of us that this problem is one that wreaks a terrible toll on our communities, a terrible toll on the young people of this country. One statistic that I cited yesterday, and that I think should be of concern to all of us, is that the single largest cause, the greatest cause of death among our young people between the ages of 15 and 20 is driving-related accidents. That is something we need to all be concerned about. Most of those accidents--so-called accidents--relate to alcohol. 
A significant contributor to the problem, I believe, is the sale of liquor through drive-up or drive-through windows. We all hear speeches and give speeches about how we do not believe we should combine drinking and driving. That is sort of a common refrain throughout our country and has been for many years. But if you want to know the time and the place and the circumstance where that mixing most obviously occurs, it is when a person drives a car up to a liquor store that has a drive-up window and that person sitting in the car as the driver of that car buys liquor or alcoholic beverages. Allowing the sales through these drive-up windows has the practical effect of preventing effective enforcement of many of our other laws. It also sends completely the wrong message to the driver and the public about refraining from drinking and driving. Let me give three examples. 
Under a law which has been adopted in virtually every State, it is against the law to sell liquor to a minor. In fact, we put that on the highway bill several years ago. We put a requirement in that States prohibit the sale of liquor to minors and, in fact, prohibit the sale of liquor to anyone less than 21 years old. 
But any young person or any law enforcement officer will tell you that sales to minors are still common in our country. A main way in which minors are able to purchase liquor and alcoholic beverages is by presenting a false ID to someone who is selling them liquor through a drive-up window. It is virtually impossible for a clerk selling through a drive-up window to see clearly who is buying the liquor, to make a good comparison between an identification which may be false in the first place with the person who is sitting there offering them money. So, having these drive-up liquor sales makes it easy for sales to minors to occur, in violation of the law. 
It is also, of course, against the law in most States to sell to someone who is already intoxicated. Again, having sales of liquor through drive-up windows makes it very difficult to enforce this law. How can a clerk in a drive-up window tell whether the person sitting in that car, offering money, is in fact intoxicated or not? You contrast that with the opportunity that a clerk has when a person has to walk into a store, a well-lighted store, walk up to a counter, and pay for alcoholic beverages. 
A third example of a law which is difficult to enforce because of these drive-up liquor windows is that most States make it illegal for people to drink while they are driving or to have open containers in the car while it is in operation. Senator Dorgan is proposing an amendment, which I strongly support this morning, on that very issue. But, again, having drive-up windows creates a tremendous opportunity and even an invitation to people to violate this law. 
The absurdity of what we are permitting to occur by allowing these drive-up sales to continue is highlighted by a practice that has been documented in my State many times, and that is a practice where a driver pulls into a drive-up window and asks for a fifth of vodka, for example, a fifth of vodka and a cup of ice, and is handed both and drives away. Clearly, no law has been violated in my State when that occurs. But if you look at the time and the place and the circumstances of that purchase, it is very difficult to conclude that that driver does not intend to violate the law and to drink while driving. 
This is a problem that deserves our attention. The statistics 
that we have are clear that there is a correlation between the States that prohibit these drive-up windows and those that have gotten their DWI problem under control. There are 26 States that have not yet banned these windows. In these States, there is a 14 percent higher alcohol-related fatality rate than in other States. In the States that do have a ban, the average DWI fatality-related rate was 4.6 per 100,000 people as opposed to 5.46 in other States. If we look at the 19 Western States, the 9 States with a ban had a 31 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the 10 States that permit sales. 
Let me just cite one terrible incident that occurred in my State. I know Senator Lautenberg talked about the Frazier family in Maryland and the pain they experienced when their young daughter was killed by a drunk driver. In New Mexico, we've had many similar occurrences. One in particular that immediately comes to my mind occurred on Christmas Eve, 1992. As part of their holiday celebration, Paul Cravens took his wife Melanie and their three daughters, Kacee, age 5; Erin, age 8; and Kandyce, age 9, to Albuquerque's West Mesa so they could get a better bird's eye view of the city's fantastic nighttime lights. They never got to see those lights. On the way to the Mesa, they were met head-on by a drunk driver traveling 90 miles an hour in the wrong direction on the interstate highway. 
People say, is there any kind of Federal concern about this? This was an interstate highway. Melanie and her three beautiful daughters were all killed. The driver of the other vehicle had been drinking through that day. He admitted that he had bought his beer at a drive-up liquor window before he took to the road that evening. 
The problem is real. We are talking about real people, real lives, real risks and dangers that we can prevent and can avoid. 
The argument about States' rights that we have heard here, to me, rings very hollow. I know there are many circumstances that have already come up where we have recognized the need to restrict the way States handle alcoholic beverages as part of a safe driving system, and clearly those issues can be discussed more as we get through the debate. 
I just want to add one other point that I believe is significant here. As I've said before, the problem of DWI and DWI-related injuries and fatalities is important in New Mexico. There is very broad public support to eliminate these windows. When I was in New Mexico two weeks ago, I held a series of seminars with high school students from throughout the state, and I listened to their concerns about the problems in the state and in the country. One young man, Simon Goldfine, who is a student at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, agreed that the DWI rate in New Mexico is much too high, and one reason he explained is these drive-up windows. Simon explained that if a drunk person has to walk into a liquor store, it will be easier to determine if he is drunk than if he simply sat in his vehicle. And Simon asked if something could be done to eliminate these windows. Today, I would like to tell Simon that we will do something about it. I believe no one in America will disagree with Simon that this ban will make a difference. I believe we owe it to everyone, to the young people like Simon and especially the people who have been touched and pained by this problem of DWI to pass this amendment. 
Mr. President, I gather my time has expired. Let me yield the rest of the time to Senator Byrd and thank him for his support of this amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Byrd made the case for the amendment more eloquently than I could. 
I believe this is a very good opportunity for us to indicate that we do have an interstate road system in this country and that it is in the national interest to be sure that people are not driving on that interstate road system who have purchased liquor under circumstances that make it more likely for them to be drunk or under the influence of alcohol. Clearly, this is a significant way in which we can further that objective. 
I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment. I yield the floor so that the Senator from North Dakota can offer the amendment that he intends to offer.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise briefly to discuss a very important matter relating to the safety of our Nation's streets and highways, DWI-related injuries and fatalities. This is a problem that in spite of many prevention efforts, remains a serious concern. 
The statistics are compelling. For example, on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, and New Years Day 1996, there were 576 DWI-related fatalities on our Nation's highways. In that same year, nearly 1.1 million people were injured in alcohol-related crashes. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15- to 20-year-olds. About 3 in 10 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at some time in their lives. Alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion annually. To make matters worse, the loss of quality of life and pain and suffering costs total over $134 billion annually. 
My home state of New Mexico is not exempt. In fact, the National Traffic Safety Administration reports that New Mexico leads the country in DWI-related deaths per capita, a rate of 11.79 deaths per 100,000 people. This rate is 19 percent higher than the No. 2 state, Mississippi, and is more than twice the national rate of 5.05 deaths per 100,000. 
Indeed, these statistics paint a very grim picture. What makes this picture even more tragic, Mr. President, is that DWI-related injuries and fatalities are preventable. It clearly is within our national interest to do everything we can to reverse this course. One obvious way to prevent further deaths on our highways is to ensure the sobriety of drivers. That is why I proudly am co-sponsoring Senator Lautenberg's and Senator DeWine's bill to establish a national blood-alcohol content standard of .08. Additionally, I am cosponsoring Senator Dorgan's bill to prohibit open containers of alcohol in automobiles. I urge my Senate colleagues to help pass these bills this year. 
Another contributing factor to the problem that I believe would make a significant difference if eliminated is the practice of selling alcohol beverages through drive-up sales windows. This practice only makes it more easy for a drunk driver to purchase alcohol, and it contributes heavily to the DWI-fatality rate in New Mexico. Eliminating these drive-up liquor windows is essential to reducing these injuries and fatalities. 
When I was in New Mexico 2 weeks ago, I held a series of seminars with high school students from throughout the state, and I listened to their concerns about the problems in the state and in the country. One young man, Simon Goldfine, who is a student at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, agreed that the DWI rate in New Mexico is much too high, and one reason he explained is these drive-in liquor windows. Simon explained that if a drunk person has to walk into a liquor store, it will be easier to determine if he is drunk than if he simply sat in his vehicle. And Simon asked if something could be done to eliminate the windows. Today I would like to tell Simon that we will do something about it. 
Today, at Simon's urging, I am introducing legislation, the Drunk Driving Casualty Prevention Act of 1998 to prohibit the sale of alcohol through drive-up sales windows. 
Mr. President, I believe no one in America will disagree with Simon that this ban will make a difference. According to one study, there are 26 states that do not permit drive-up windows. In 1996, these states had a 15 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the 24 states that 
permit these windows. In the states with the ban, the average rate was 4.6 per 100,000 people, as opposed to 5.46 in all other states. On a percentage basis, states with a ban had a 14.5 percent lower drunk driving fatality rate than states that permit sales windows. 
In 1996, comparing 19 western states in particular, the nine states with a ban had a 31 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the ten states that permit the windows. 
In 1995, there were 231 drunk driving fatalities in New Mexico. Based on the 14-percent lower drunk driving fatality rate, it is estimated that closing drive-up liquor windows could save between 32 and 35 lives annually in New Mexico. Nowhere is it more true that if we can save one life by closing these windows, we should do it. 
The differences can be explained because there are three main benefits to closing drive-up liquor windows: first, it is easier and more accurate to check IDs over the sales counter. Minors have testified that it is very easy to illegally purchase alcohol at a drive-up window where it is difficult to determine their age. Second, it is easier to visually observe a customer for clues that they are impaired by alcohol or other substance if they have to walk into a well-lit establishment to make their purchase. Moreover, in one municipal court in New Mexico, 33 percent of DWI offenders reported having purchased their liquor at drive up windows. Some members of Alcoholics Anonymous say they now realize they could have known each other years earlier if they had only looked in their rear view mirror while in line at a drive-up window. And third, it sends a clear message to the population that drinking and driving will not be tolerated. 
The Behavior Health Research Center of the Southwest conducted a study, the purpose of which was to determine the characteristics and arrest circumstances of DWI offenders who bought alcohol at a drive-up liquor window compared to those who obtained alcohol elsewhere. Nearly 70 percent of offenders studied reported having purchased the alcohol they drank prior to arrest. Of those offenders, 42 percent bought package liquor, and of those offenders, the drive-up window was the preferred place of purchase. Additionally, the study showed that drive-up window users were 68 percent more likely to have a serious alcohol problem than other offenders. Drive-up window users also are 67 percent more likely to be drinking in their vehicle prior to arrest than other offenders. This study showed that drive-up windows facilitate alcohol misuse in vulnerable populations. The persons most affected are the high-risk problem drinkers, and when liquor availability is restricted, it is among those offenders that use, and consequently alcohol-related offenses, declines the most. 
There are some that may contend that closing these windows is going to hurt small businesses. To the contrary. Closing these drive-up liquor windows will actually help increase profits, and it is very easy to explain. When a customer has to walk into an establishment, he or she is very likely to purchase more than the original item. The customer is likely to pick up, for example, potato chips, sodas, and magazines. This is not as likely to happen at the drive-up window simply because the customers cannot see the items from their vehicle. In McKinley County, New Mexico, which is the only county in New Mexico to ban these windows, businesses actually saw a jump in profits. Most importantly, because of its DWI prevention strategy, McKinley County's alcohol-related injury and fatality rate dropped from 272 per 100,000 in 1989 to 183 per 100,000 in 1997.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mayor Ernest Thompson who has announced his retirement after 26 years as Mayor of Artesia, New Mexico. I am proud to honor this great New Mexican, who personifies leadership and commitment to public service and to his community. 
Mr. Thompson was first elected Mayor of Artesia in 1972 and has served continually for seven terms since then. A lot has changed in Artesia since Mayor Thompson was first elected. He remembers that when he first started, the city had no money for some of the most basic municipal necessities. For example, he remembers that the garbage trucks didn't even have doors. 
Mayor Thompson has helped to turn the city around. Under him, the city's equipment has been improved, new construction has been started, and Artesia's economy has flourished. During his tenure, Mayor Thompson has been pivotal in bringing the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center to Artesia, in improving the conditions of the streets and parks and in the creation of Artesia's industrial park, police and fire stations, a retard dam, and many other projects important to the community of Artesia. 
Mayor Thompson has not only been an active mayor for Artesia; he has also served in many other leadership roles. He has been a member of the National League of Cities, Southeastern New Mexico Economic Development District, and the New Mexico Municipal League, for which he has served as President, and as well as First and Second Vice President 
He is also a tireless contributor to community organizations. He has served as president of the Artesia Rotary Club, the New Mexico Gideons, the Artesia Quarterback Club, and the Parents and Boosters Clubs. He is the Finance Chairman for the First Methodist Church of Artesia and has a 46 year association with the Boy Scouts of America, for which he has served as everything from Cub Master to District Chairman. He is also the recipient of the Boy Scouts' Silver Beaver Award. 
Mayor Thompson has been involved in so much as Mayor that we are thankful for, but he would probably say his greatest accomplishment is his marriage of over 55 years to his wife, Grace. Together, they have one son and two grandchildren. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Earnest Thompson for his years of dedication. New Mexico will miss his tireless service and we all wish him and his family the best in the coming years.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to discuss a very important matter relating to the safety of our Nation's highways and streets, and that is DWI-related injuries and fatalities. To use more common parlance, drunk driving. This is a problem that, in spite of many prevention efforts, remains a very serious concern in our country. 
The statistics are compelling. For example, on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day 1996, those 4 days combined, there were 576 DWI-related fatalities on our Nation's highways. In that same year, 1996, nearly 1.1 million people were injured in alcohol-related crashes. 
Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15- to 20-year-olds. I think that statistic alone should get the attention of the U.S. Senate and the Congress of this country. Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for 15- to 20-year-olds throughout this country. About 3 in 10 Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at some time in their lives. Alcohol-related crashes cost society $45 billion annually, and to make matters worse, the loss of quality of life and pain and suffering costs are estimated to total over $134 billion annually. 
My home State of New Mexico is not exempt from these problems. In fact, the National Traffic Safety Administration reports that my State of New Mexico leads the country in DWI-related deaths per capita. The rate in New Mexico is 11.79 deaths per 100,000 people.

This practice only makes it more easy for a drunk driver to purchase alcohol and contributes heavily to the DWI fatality rate in my home State and throughout the country. Eliminating these drive-up liquor windows is essential to reducing these injuries and fatalities. 
Tomorrow I will introduce legislation entitled the `Drunk Driving Casualty Prevention Act of 1998' to prohibit the sale of alcohol through drive-up sales windows. I hope to have some cosponsors for that provision at that time. 
Mr. President, this ban will make a difference. According to one study, there are 26 States that do not permit drive-up windows. In 1996, these States had, as a combined effort, a 15-percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the 24 States that permit sales through drive-up windows. 
In the States with the ban, the average rate was 4.6 for 100,000 people as opposed to 5.46 in all other States. On a percentage basis, States with a ban had a 14.5 percent lower drunk driving fatality rate than States that permit sales through windows. 
In 1996, comparing 19 Western States in particular, the nine States that have a ban in place had a 31 percent lower average drunk driving fatality rate than the States that permit sales. 
In 1995, there were 231 drunk driving fatalities in my home State of New Mexico. Based on the 14 percent lower drunk driving fatality rate, it is estimated that closing drive-up liquor windows could have saved between 32 and 35 lives in that year in my State. Nowhere is it more true that if we can save one life by closing these windows, we need to do that. 
The difference can be explained because there are three main benefits that accrue when you close drive-up liquor windows. 
First, once the windows are closed, it is easier and more accurate to check the identification when the customers have to purchase their liquor over the counter. Minors have testified that it is very easy to illegally purchase alcohol at a drive-up window where it is difficult to determine their age. 
A second benefit is that it is easier to visually observe a customer for clues that that customer is impaired by alcohol or other substances if they have to walk into a well-lighted establishment to make their purchase. 
In one municipal court in New Mexico, 33 percent of the DWI offenders reported having purchased their liquor at drive-up windows. Some members of Alcoholics Anonymous say they now realize they could have known each other years earlier if they only looked in their rearview mirror while waiting in line at the drive-up window to buy their liquor. 
And third, it sends a clear message to the population that drinking and driving will not be allowed to mix. 
The Behavior Health Research Center of the Southwest conducted a study, the purpose of which was to determine the characteristics and the arrest circumstances of DWI offenders who bought alcohol at drive-up liquor windows compared to those who obtained it elsewhere. Nearly 70 percent of the offenders studied reported having purchased the alcohol that they drank prior to arrest. Of those offenders, 42 percent bought packaged liquor, and the drive-up window was the preferred place of purchase. 
The study showed that drive-up window users were 68 percent more likely to have a serious alcohol problem than other offenders. Drive-up window users also are 67 percent more likely to be drinking in their vehicle prior to arrest than other offenders are. 
Mr. President, we have had one sort of test case in New Mexico, and that is in McKinley County. It was one county in our State that had a terrible problem with DWI and petitioned our legislature for permission to close the windows in that county, the drive-up windows. They did close those windows. Businesses in that community did not see their profits cut in two--the liquor businesses. In fact, they saw their profits jump. The DWI prevention strategy that was employed in McKinley County reduced the fatality rate from 272 per 100,000 in 1989 to 183 per 100,000 in 1997. 
Mr. President, I believe we have a great opportunity here to reduce DWI injuries and fatalities. I plan to offer this amendment to the ISTEA legislation tomorrow or later this week. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring that legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about a very special anniversary this year in New Mexico, and to share a message from President Clinton to everyone celebrating the state's Cuartocentenario. 
The date July 1, 1998, marks 400 years since a small group of Spanish pioneers ventured north from Mexico, up the Rio Grande Valley and settled in what is now North-Central New Mexico. The settlers, led by Don Juan de Onate, established a small mission at the confluence of the Rio Chama and the Rio Grande and next to an Indian Pueblo the inhabitants called `Ohke'. The Spanish settlers named their mission San Gabriel de los Espanoles. 
This year is not just about recognizing these early Spanish settlements, but about celebrating the Hispanic people themselves and the many contributions they have made to the history of this continent and this country over the last 400 years. Indeed, we can point to all aspects of American culture, from literature to sports, and identify many Hispanic individuals who have made significant contributions.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's line-item veto of these 38 military construction projects which we approved in the 1998 budget. 
I think the recent district court decision that would reverse legislation granting the President the right to veto individual projects confirms my view of what the Constitution requires. I opposed extending the line-item veto authority to this President or to any President because I believe that those who wrote our Constitution had it right. The separation of powers assigned by the Constitution prevents political manipulation that does a disservice to the democratic process. 
Aside from the constitutional question, however, I want to say a few words about why I believe that the President's choices, at least the ones I am familiar with, for program vetoes were ill-advised, at least in the case of the projects in New Mexico that are included in this bill. These were not pork barrel projects. I understood my colleague from Arizona and his comments about opposition to pork barrel spending in the defense bill, and I commend him for that because I agree with him that there are numerous instances each year where projects are added that cannot be justified on a military basis. I do not condone that in any way. 
By its own admission, the administration canceled a number of the projects this year in this bill because in the administration's view they did not meet the criteria that they had set up for selection. In spite of what the administration concluded, I'm persuaded that many of these projects were important to the quality of life of military personnel and their families. In addition, many of these projects had been able to complete significant planning that would permit their construction to begin in 1998. 
Let me just indicate the sequence of events that occurred with regard to some of the projects in New Mexico when this list of projects that the President was going to line-item veto came out. On the list were some projects that I will refer to later, including White Sands Missile Range, to refurbish aging facilities at White Sands Missile Range. I called the director of the Office of Management and Budget and asked why they had chosen to delete these particular projects. His response was that according to the information he had been given by the Department of Defense, the necessary planning and design work for construction or refurbishing of those facilities had not been done and the money could not be spent in 1998. 
We went back to the Army, which is the military service that had the funding in its budget, and asked if we had false information here or inaccurate information and what their understanding was. They assured us, as they had before, that this money was needed, that these were projects where design and construction planning had occurred, and that the money could well be spent in 1998. 
I am persuaded that at least with regard to those projects, the Office of Management and Budget was giving the President incorrect advice or incorrect information and that incorrect information was the basis upon which the President chose to line-item veto those particular projects. I don't think this was intentional on anyone's part. Nobody was intentionally misrepresenting the situation, but in its haste to compile a list of projects to veto and in its concern for maintaining secrecy about that list, the administration did not submit candidate projects to the kind of thorough review that such important decisions normally warrant. 
I blame the process that was used. Obviously, as I have said before, I believe the process is unconstitutional and has fatal flaws in that regard. But clearly, in addition to that, I think this process was flawed because of this inaccurate information that was given to the President. 
As I stated before, part of what the President vetoed was funding to refurbish aging facilities at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Of course, I am concerned about that because many of my constituents work on that facility and believe that facility is important. But I am also concerned because, as General Reimer recently testified before the Armed Services Committee, White Sands is a critical national asset; it is our most capable test evaluation center. 
It is the premier facility that we have with unique capabilities to test new technologies and weapons, to ensure continued technological superiority over any potential adversary. 
The test range is operated by the Army, but it supports testing by all of our various military services. Also, it supports testing by many companies in the private sector. Because of that fact, that the Army does not exclusively benefit from the work at White Sands, the installation has been vulnerable to budget and personnel cuts in the Army that threaten the continued capability of that range. Accordingly, it threatens the continued long-term national security of the country. 
Since 1995, for example, White Sands has lost about 43 percent of its military contingent needed to ensure that the users participate in the design, test, and operation of new weapons systems. If the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Plan is fully implemented, then White Sands would eventually lose all of its soldiers who are assigned to operate, maintain, and test systems being evaluated. 
Similar severe cutbacks have occurred in the civilian work force needed to support the scientific work and operations of the test range. 
Meanwhile, the testing workload at White Sands continues to increase as the services move toward this high-tech weaponry of tomorrow's military services. I am concerned because I did visit White Sands this last week and I had the opportunity to observe the conditions of the range firsthand. Many of the facilities on the base date back to World War II. Some of the launch facilities are lodged in makeshift trailers with jury-rigged air conditioning and outdoor toilet facilities. 
The risk of fire hazard is great at many of White Sands' widely dispersed facilities, and the ability of the base to combat a blaze effectively is extremely limited. Personnel risk their personal safety in some of these facilities that the President's line-item veto would prevent from being replaced. 
Mr. President, my concern extends beyond the refurbishment of the aging buildings at White Sands. I am concerned, also, that the instrumentation that we have in place to conduct and analyze tests at White Sands is inadequate to meet the challenges of new technologies and weapons systems of the future. 
Instrumentation at the range is simply not capable of meeting high optical, radar, and telemetry standards needed to observe, report, and evaluate tests of new technologies that are now being designed. 
Scientists and the military personnel at White Sands indicated to me that it could cost in the range of $110 million to modernize the instrumentation at White Sands sufficiently in order to meet future test requirements. 
While we fully intend to modernize our military weapons, we are not taking the steps necessary to ensure through testing that those weapons will work as designed and as needed. 
White Sands is critical to meeting these requirements. If we permit the President's line-item veto to stand, we would endanger our national security interests by continuing to allow the Nation's preeminent testing facility at White Sands to atrophy further than it already has. 
I call on my colleagues to reverse the President's veto and to join me in ensuring the future effectiveness of White Sands during this year's defense authorization and appropriations debates. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we engage in a significant military confrontation in the Persian Gulf, the Senate should thoroughly examine the reasons for, and the likely outcomes of, such action. Many of our colleagues have begun to do so in speeches on this floor over the past several days. I look forward to a continuation of this vigorous debate when the Majority Leader brings forward his resolution on this topic. 
I believe that we must also take concrete action today, by amending and passing the bill that is now before us, to ensure that our nation and our economy are fully prepared to deal with any adverse effect that military action in the Gulf might have on the world's supply of oil from that region. 
About 65 percent of the world's known oil reserves lie in the Persian Gulf region. That region supplies one-quarter of the oil that the world now consumes. Although Persian Gulf oil is responsible for a smaller fraction of U.S. oil consumption, world oil markets are highly interconnected. Any threat to the continued supply of Persian Gulf oil at current rates of production will quickly translate into volatile, higher prices here in the United States. 
One can see this in the historical record. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, world oil prices rose sharply, and American consumers paid accordingly. Between August 1, 1990 and December 1, 1990, U.S. consumers spent $21 billion more for crude oil and petroleum products than would have been spent absent that Middle East crisis. Events in Iraq continue to drive world oil markets. On November 13, 1997, the day that Saddam Hussein intensified the current crisis by ejecting U.S. inspectors from Iraq, the world price of oil rose by 20 cents per barrel. The last time we waged war on Saddam Hussein, our strategy included not only amassing multilateral military might in the Persian Gulf, but also minimizing the conflict's economic impact at home. We appear headed for another major military confrontation in the Gulf, 
but thanks to inaction by the other body, the second part of our 1991 strategy is currently not even an option. 
President Bush had two tools at his disposal to reduce the economic effects of a military conflict in the Persian Gulf. The first was an economic alliance among the world's major oil-consuming countries, the independent International Energy Agency (or IEA). The United States formed the IEA after the Arab oil embargo of 1973, so that we would never again experience the market chaos, including gas station lines, that occurred back then. The initial IEA approach for dealing with oil supply disruptions was through mandatory allocations--having an international committee decide which nation would get how much oil. 
The world has changed since then. 1970s-style command-and-control supply allocations won't work today. Instead, the United States has taken the lead in designing a flexible, market-friendly response to oil supply disruptions. The new approach relies on a coordinated drawdown of worldwide oil supplies. President Bush pioneered such a system during the 1991 Gulf War, although the oil companies that cooperated at that time placed themselves in legal jeopardy for having done so. The United States, with the full backing of our domestic oil industry, has refined this concept and convinced all of the other countries in the IEA to adopt it. But without passage of a law to facilitate the sharing of information about oil supplies in an emergency, the mechanism cannot be used. 
If the world encounters oil market instability, the IEA will need to know about the location and movement of oil supplies in order to coordinate a response. Most of these oil supplies are privately held, so only oil companies have the needed information. Sharing such information is normally forbidden under U.S. antitrust laws, which apply to the world's major oil companies by virtue of their operation in this country. But in a genuine emergency, the national interest in the free flow of oil is far greater than the interest in keeping oil companies from sharing inventory information. Accordingly, there is already an emergency antitrust exemption in law that allows oil companies to share information with the IEA, but only to implement the outdated command-and-control response to an oil crisis, and only if the oil supply disruption is of mammoth proportions. Both the Bush and Clinton Administrations have sought to make this antitrust exemption apply to the types of oil crises we are actually likely to see, and to coordinated emergency responses other than mandatory worldwide oil supply allocations. This revised antitrust exemption would apply only when information sharing was expressly requested by the U.S. government. This is what we need to enact into law, now. Without these changes, the United States could find itself in the absurd position of being unable to use the international oil emergency response system that we ourselves designed. 
The second tool that President Bush had at his disposal in 1991 was the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)--586 million barrels of crude oil, stored in underground salt caverns at five sites along the coast of Texas and Louisiana. At the beginning of Operation Desert Storm, President Bush ordered the drawdown and sale of oil from the SPR. This had a powerful calming influence on world oil markets. Incredible as it may seem, such a use of the SPR by President Clinton would be illegal today. The United States still owns 563 million barrels of crude oil in underground salt caverns, but the President's authority to sell it in response to an emergency has lapsed. 
How could we be so vulnerable to such clear and present dangers? I regret that once again, in the immortal words of Pogo, we have met the enemy, and he is us. The Administration has beseeched the Congress, for years now, to update the legal framework governing the IEA and to renew its authority to operate the SPR. The Senate has repeatedly and unanimously passed such legislation. The other body has refused to act, for reasons that are very difficult to understand. 
With a major military confrontation in the Persian Gulf imminent, further delay is inexcuseable. We cannot allow our economy to be needlessly vulnerable to, say, a terrorist attack on Middle East oil infrastructure. I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for his persistence in trying to resolve this problem. I fully support his amendment to H.R. 2472, which provides the President with all the tools he needs to respond to an oil supply disruption. In the current situation, to do any less would be irresponsible. I hope that the other body now acts quickly on this matter. If the House has concerns, let us quickly convene a joint House-Senate conference to resolve them. If not, then let this bill become law.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to join Senator Conrad and my other colleagues in introducing the HEALTHY Kids Act. I want to commend Senator Conrad, and his staff, for their excellent work in formulating this legislation. I firmly believe that this legislation represents the opportunity to prevent nicotine addiction in children and youth. 
The Congress has the truly historic opportunity this year to enact comprehensive legislation that will reduce access to and consumption of tobacco by our youth. Over the past few months, I have been part of the task force that helped consider the numerous issues involved in developing a comprehensive approach to address the public health issues that surround youth and tobacco. The HEALTHY Kids Act gives us a blueprint for reducing the terrible destruction that tobacco products have caused. 
The Senate has a compelling interest to address the various issues raised by the tobacco settlement. The Office on Smoking and Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that cigarettes kill more Americans that AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, drugs, and fires combined. 
Additionally, As the smoke screen erected by the tobacco companies begins to clear through numerous court proceedings, we now know what we have suspected all along: The targeting of our children has been a well planned, well orchestrated, and well financed conspiracy by these companies. 
We have all seen the statistics. The Institute of Medicine finds that despite the market decline in adult smoking and the social disapproval of smoking, an estimated 3,000 young people become regular smokers every day. In my home state of New Mexico, roughly 33% of our youth in grades 9 through 12, smoke. Indeed, Mr. President, nationally, the prevalence of smoking by youth, has remained basically unchanged since 1980. If current tobacco use patterns in this nation persist, five million children currently alive today will die prematurely from a smoking related disease. 
It is worth noting that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. All cancers caused by cigarette smoking can be prevented. Instead, according to CDC and Robert Wood Johnson, 170,000 Americans will lose their lives to tobacco related cancer this year. Preventing and reducing cigarette smoking are key to reducing illness and death. We must act now. 
There will be myriad reasons put forth as to why we cannot or should not enact this legislation. There will be some who will say that Congress should not act at all. We have the opportunity and the obligation to enact legislation that will address the public health problems caused by tobacco products. The HEALTHY Kids Act gives us the chance to begin reversing the damage that has been done. It provides the vehicle for leadership that will be necessary to save our children. I hope that we will move, and move quickly without any more excuses, to enact this legislation.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 
I rise today to introduce legislation that will mean a great deal to the future economic development of the Navajo Nation and to the people in the Four Corners Region of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado. 
Mr. President, we are truly fortunate today to have one of the lowest national unemployment rates in recent memory. Unfortunately, the administration's economic juggernaut has not been felt everywhere. While national unemployment rates are below five percent, in my state of New Mexico, unemployment remains stuck at 8%. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, New Mexico has the second highest unemployment rate in the country, right behind the District of Columbia. 
Regrettably, one of the nation's highest unemployment rates is on the Navajo Indian Reservation, where unemployment is a staggering 50%. The unemployment rate in neighboring San Juan County is 12%, which is more than twice the national average. These statistics should be deeply troubling to all senators. Clearly, there is no region in this country in greater need of targeted economic development. Creating jobs is precisely the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today. 
In a nutshell, this bill allows the Navajo Nation's Indian Irrigation Project to use a portion of its existing allocation of federal electric power to help spur economic development and to create good jobs in the region. 
Mr. President, in 1962 Congress authorized the construction and operation of the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project. The project has blossomed into a 60,000 acre agricultural enterprise growing potatoes, beans, alfalfa, wheat, corn and livestock with annual revenues of $36 million. Today, the `Navajo Pride' brand name is a hallmark of agricultural quality nationwide. The Tribe's own Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) operates this successful all-Indian project. NAPI has a full-time staff of 300. The workforce swells to 1,200 during the summer growing season. 
In the 1962 legislation, Congress authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to reserve eighty-seven megawatts of electric power for use by the project. It is clear from the original authorization that the primary purpose of the project was to deliver water for the development of farming and allied industries. The reserved electric power is currently used to pump water to the project and to provide the water pressure needed for irrigation. The original plans called for the use of gravity-fed irrigation; however, the irrigation method was later changed to a more efficient electric-powered center-pivot system. Unfortunately, Congress had not foreseen these improvements and did not specifically authorize the use of federal power to run irrigation sprinklers. In a letter to me dated November 5, 1997, Commissioner Martinez of the Bureau of Reclamation stated that Congress had not provided the bureau with sufficient authority to allow NAPI to use its existing allocation of electric power for anything other than water pumping. Congress simply failed to authorize the use of federal power to run the sprinklers or for processing of the products grown there. 
The legislation I am introducing would allow NAPI to use its existing power allocation to run the project's irrigation sprinklers or factories on the reservation that process the agricultural products. This legislation does not increase the amount of power allocated to NAPI--nobody's allocation of electric power is reduced or affected in any way. Moreover, the change would have no cost or other impact on taxpayers. 
This legislation is a simple technical change. It clarifies existing congressional language. Moreover, because this is an all-Indian project established by Congress to benefit the Navajo Nation, this legislation does not create a precedent that would apply to any other irrigation project. 
This bill has the support of the Bureau of Reclamation. In addition, the Republican Governor of the state of New Mexico and the nearby cities, counties, and electric utility companies support this change because they recognize the economic benefits for the entire Four Corners Region. I would particularly like to acknowledge the City of Farmington and Republican Mayor Thomas C. Taylor for support of the project as reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding between the City and NAPI. In addition, the State of New Mexico has supported this effort with a grant to study water issues and by permitting the Navajo Nation to use state bonding capacity. 
Mr. President, Congress must not delay action to help reduce the unacceptable unemployment rates on the Navajo Reservation. This bill is an important step toward creating hundreds of year-round jobs and spurring economic development in San Juan County and the rest of the Four Corners Region. I urge the Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to schedule a hearing on this worthy legislation at the earliest possible date.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to give praise to a great man. Ralph Tasker has announced that after 52 seasons of coaching, he will retire as the head basketball coach at Hobbs High School in New Mexico. In his 52 seasons, Coach Tasker has amassed over 1,103 wins en route to 12 State championships, 4 State runner-up titles, and 1 National Coach of the Year title. Indeed, Coach Tasker's legacy is that of a man who not only won many basketball games, but also brought his positive influence into the lives of hundreds of high school students. 
From 1965 to 1967, Coach Tasker's team won 53 consecutive games. In the 1969-70 season, his team averaged 114.6 points per game, earning him the prestigious National Coach of the Year title. In the 1980's, Coach Tasker continued his winning ways as he led his team to consecutive undefeated seasons from 1980-82, and he was elected to the National High School Sports Hall of Fame. 
Mr. President, on the eve of the third-winningest active high school coach's retirement, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ralph Tasker for his years of dedication to the youth of New Mexico. Certainly, we all have a lot to learn from this man, and his example stands as a marker that we should all strive to attain. Thank you, Coach Tasker, for teaching us the true meaning of winning gracefully.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak about Senate Resolution 148, designating 1998 as the `Onate Cuatro-centenario,' the anniversary commemoration of the first Spanish settlement in New Mexico. First, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici with whom I have the great pleasure of marking this anniversary. And I thank my Senate colleagues for co-sponsoring the resolution. The bi-partisan support for this resolution I believe is indicative of the broad understanding and appreciation for the cultural contributions that Hispanics have made in our American society. 
This resolution commemorates one of the most meaningful and significant dates of both New Mexico and American history. July 1, 1598 stands out in history because it was on that day, almost 180 years before the Declaration of Independence was signed in Philadelphia, that a small group of Spanish pioneers ventured north from Mexico, up the Rio Grande Valley and settled in what is now North-Central New Mexico. The settlers, led by Don Juan de Onate, established a small mission at the confluence of the Rio Chama and the Rio Grande and next to an Indian Pueblo the inhabitants called `Ohke.' The Spanish settlers named their mission San Gabriel de los Espanoles. 
From San Gabriel, Spanish families moved outward and, in 1610 established the mission of `La Villa Real de Santa Fe', now well-known as `Santa Fe.' Other settlements were soon established throughout the Rio Grande Valley, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Texas following the long-established settlements in Florida. 
As much as this resolution commemorates the early Spanish settlements on this continent, it is meant to do much more. This resolution celebrates the Hispanic people themselves and the many contributions they have made to the history of this continent and this country over the last 400 years. 
Indeed, many Hispanics have earned a place in American history. During the American Revolution, Bernardo de Galvez, a Spanish aristrocrat and governor of the Spanish province of Louisiana, was instrumental in helping defeat the British navy and army near the Gulf of Mexico. 
During the Civil War, David Glasgow Farragut, also of Spanish descent, commanded a Union naval expedition against the city of New Orleans. Because of his leadership at the battle for Fort Jackson, President Lincoln promoted Farragut to Rear Admiral. 
Hispanics have made significant contributions also in the area of Science. Luis Alvarez, for example, won the Nobel Prize for Physics. Alvarez taught at University of California-Berkeley and was later instrumental in the development of radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1944, he went to work on the development of the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico. 
Of course, I cannot speak of distinguished Hispanics without speaking of New Mexico's own Dennis Chavez, whom many of my Senate colleagues no doubt remember well. Dennis Chavez was one of eight children and through hard work and determination became one of New Mexico's distinguished Congressmen in 1934. Not long after that, he became United States Senator, and while in the Senate worked tirelessly for fair employment and civil rights legislation. 
Madam President, I easily can point to all aspects of our American society, from literature to sports, and identify many Hispanic individuals who have made significant contributions. It is a tremendous history--indeed, more than 400 years of history. Through this resolution, I wish to help New Mexico and our Nation celebrate that history. Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Dr. David Satcher for confirmation both as the Surgeon General of the United States and Assistant Secretary for Health. In so doing, I want to speak both to the position of Surgeon General itself and to the qualifications of this nominee. 
From 1871 until the present, 16 individuals have had the honor to serve as this nation's chief advisor on public health matters. These individuals served to protect, improve, and advance the health of all people in the United States. While there are those that criticize and may disagree with the position, in many ways the Surgeon General serves as the health conscience for the country. 
Many Americans may not know the history of this position and can name few of the 16 individuals who have served as Surgeon General. However, most Americans can point to ground breaking reports or initiatives that were conducted by Surgeon Generals. For instance, they are aware of the role of the Surgeon General in programs to immunize millions against polio. Most can cite the important declaration in 1964, by the Surgeon General that: `smoking can be hazardous to your health.' Indeed, past Surgeon Generals have issued benchmark reports on smoking, nutrition, water fluoridation, and HIV and AIDS. 
The public deserves to have this position filled; it has been vacant for too long. We have been without a Surgeon General since December of 1994. We need an identifiable, objective leader as we deal with the broad spectrum of health care issues before the country. Dr. David Satcher is that leader. 
Dr. Satcher is a distinguished family physician, academician, and leader in the arena of public health. Indeed, he has headed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1993. He has written that he will utilize the position of the Surgeon General to focus on issues that unite Americans. I am particularly interested in his commitment to, and expertise on, the issues of health promotion and disease prevention. During his confirmation hearing before the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, he emphasized his desire to promote healthy lifestyles and focus on issues of critical importance such as better nutrition and exercise. Dr. Satcher recognized the opportunities for lifestyle modification as a way of improving the health of Americans. His performance in this arena in the past and his stated agenda for the future, place prevention as a focal point. 
Mr. President, the accomplishments of Dr. Satcher at the CDC have had a direct impact in my home state of New Mexico. For New Mexico, border health issues are of utmost importance. Dr. Satcher has helped develop an innovative strategy to combat threats from new and reemerging communicable diseases like tuberculosis which cause problems in our border region. Greater outreach to the general public and health professionals has resulted in four straight years for declining TB rates. 
Additionally, he has worked to improve the quality and quantity of immunization services. He has promoted better community involvement in the immunization programs. Nationwide, childhood immunization rates rose to a record 78 percent under his leadership at the CDC. 
Another initiative, the CDC comprehensive breast and cervical cancer screening program, has flourished under Dr. Satcher's leadership. This program has undeserved and minority women has grown from being offered in the initial eighteen states, to including 50 states, the District of Columbia, 5 U.S. territories, and thirteen Native American organizations. Outreach efforts such as this lead to increased access and are key to reaching low income minority and older women. They afford the opportunity as well to educate at risk women on early detection of cancers. 
In closing, Dr. David Satcher is eminently qualified to speak out for the public's health and the nation's health needs. The nation deserves to have this position filled now. His commitment to public health will be a credit to this country. Please join me in supporting Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join in the introduction of the Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. Act. The initiative is designed to improve access, quality and affordability of child care. 
Access to child care is a necessity for all working parents. Nationwide, 55% of children under age six have both parents (if they live with two parents) or their single parent in the labor force. That figure rises to 61% of school age children who have both or their only parent in the labor force. In my home state of New Mexico, 54% of preschool and 63% of school age children have both or their only parent in the workforce. 
Another way of thinking of the magnitude of the issue is to consider that more than half of all preschool children are away from their parents most of the day and two out of three school age children are likely to require child care before or after school. With the passage of the TANF legislation in 1997, a number of mothers will be entering the workforce for the first time and will require child care if they are to succeed in the job market. 
Mr. President, while I may not agree with every portion of the bill, I believe that we need to improve child care access, quality, and affordability for our working families. I believe that this bill affords us the best approach to these child care issues and urge others to join in support of this initiative. 
Access is a problem for many parents and expansion of the child care and development block grants is one step toward increasing the availability of child care programs. Accessibility grows even more complicated when we look at our rural areas of the country. Each community has unique circumstances to overcome, such as a lack of resources, programs, and transportation. Since the issues of availability and access are addressed in this initiative, I am hopeful that individual states will be able to address their most critical needs. 
Yet, Mr. President, improving access without improving the quality of the child care is an empty gesture. Staff education and training are among the most critical elements in improving quality. Currently, many states do not require providers who care for children in their homes to have any training prior to serving children. I am told that 33 states allow teachers in child care centers to start work without prior training. This legislation includes incentives to encourage states to invest in activities that will enhance provider-child ratios, improve the enforcement of licensing standards, improve the compensation of child care providers, and offer training and education to child care providers. It is essential that we have child care staff who are trained to provide the necessary care and then have salaries commensurate with their training to retain them in the field. It is a credit to those who have worked in crafting this bill that they have ensured that child care for children with special health care needs will be addressed as well. 
My state currently has many families who cannot find the quality, affordable child care they need to ensure that their children are well cared for and safe. Currently, child care is unaffordable for many working families in New Mexico. Full day child care for one child can easily cost $4,000 to $10,000 per year, which is a lot of money in a state where the average per capita income is $18,803. This is beyond the reach of many families. These families simply cannot afford the cost of quality child care in addition to all of the other demands on their monthly budget. Increasing the Child Care and Development Block Grants will increase the amount of child care subsidies available to working families. 
Finally, Mr. President, this bill addresses a critical area: the issue of after school care for school age children. Good after school options can help children and teens do well in school and stay out of trouble. It is estimated that nearly 5 million children are left unsupervised by an adult after school each week. Studies have shown that juvenile crime actually peaks between 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. when many children are unsupervised. Additionally, I am told that one study found that eighth graders left home alone after school reported greater use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana than those who were in adult supervised settings. Our initiative will allow us to strengthen local resources and is designed to improve the quality of care in after school programs. 
In closing, the legislation covers the full spectrum of child care from early childhood to adolescent after school needs. I look forward to participating in the debate on making child care affordable and accessible. I am hopeful that the Senate will move forward on these issues of utmost importance to our working families, parents and children alike.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I may not take a full 10 minutes, I advise the Senator from Connecticut. 
Let me start and make the points that I came here to make because I do believe that some important issues were raised by the President last night in the State of the Union Address, and they are points that are worthwhile to go back and look at for just a minute. 
One change that has occurred here in Washington in the time I have been here--and it was very clear last night when I listened to the President--is that we now have a consensus; at least a majority agree that education is a national responsibility as well as a State and local responsibility. I can remember very recently--and you still hear people say this, but not many anymore--but I can remember when a substantial number of people used to say education is not an appropriate issue for the Federal Government to concern itself with. 
Clearly, it is a great concern for the people I represent in New Mexico, and it is a great concern for working families all over this country; but `it should not be a concern for people who come to Washington to make the laws or to appropriate funds or to allocate tax dollars because this is not a national responsibility.' That was the argument that we always heard. I think one of the great legacies that this President will leave and this Congress will leave is that there is a change in that attitude. There is a recognition here in Washington, finally, that just as every other industrial nation in the world considers education a national concern as well as a State and local concern, here in America we need to consider it a national concern as well as a State and local concern as well. So I think that is a major change and a change for the better. 
Last year, Congress and the President agreed on some very significant initiatives in the area of education--a new HOPE scholarship for 2 years of college, a $3 billion overall increase in education funding was included last year, and funding for a new $210 million reading initiative. There were various other initiatives in the education area that were agreed upon by Democrats and Republicans alike. So we have made progress so far in the 105th Congress, and in the second session we can make more progress. I have heard some speeches today and some comments today by my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, and they go along two lines. Number one is the old argument that this is not a national concern, education is not a national concern, we should not be doing more in this area. We ought to leave it up to local school districts if they want to do it. Second, there is no money. We may have the largest economy in the world, and we may be in a period where the Union is strong and where the economy is strong and where we are finally getting to a balanced budget, or very near to it, but there is no money. `We now spend less than 2 percent of our Federal budget on education and that is too much. We can't afford to spend any more.' That is the argument I hear. 
I don't think the American people agree with that. When I go to my State and have town hall meetings and visits with people around New Mexico, I hear them say they are shocked to find that the Federal Government commits so little in resources relative to what the Federal Government spends in other areas. So I think we are expected by the people who sent us here to do better by education. The President is showing us the way to do that. 
There are three areas in particular I want to highlight today where I think he is showing some leadership, and we need to follow that leadership and try to make a difference. One is in the very important area of lowering the dropout rate in our schools, reaching those at-risk students who historically have left high school before they graduate. We have oversized schools in this country. We have low expectations of many of our students. We have inadequate involvement of parents in the education of their children. As a result of all of these factors, over 500,000 students each year in this country drop out of school before they complete high school. Thirty percent of the young Hispanic adults in this country lack a high school degree because of that very problem. This is a national tragedy, in my opinion, and we at the Federal level can do some things to try to assist with this problem. 
I hope very much we will take the lead of the President in doing that. He has proposed key programs such as title I, the TRIO program, bilingual education, and several new initiatives to make 
schools more conducive to learning, to raise expectations and lower dropout rates. He has proposed $12 billion for class size reduction and teacher training and a mentoring program for at-risk middle school students. He has proposed $150 million for comprehensive reform. Now, that funding would go to schools with a serious dropout problem that want to focus on restructuring those schools and coming up with ways to give attention to the at-risk student, to keep them in that school, prevent them from dropping out. That is an initiative that is worth our effort and support. 
A second area, in addition to the dropout problem that the President is providing leadership on and that we here in Congress have done a substantial amount on in recent years, is providing computers and access to the Internet for the students in our schools today. Technological literacy is an essential part of being educated today. We need to ensure that the schools throughout this Nation are equipped so that students who come through those schools have access to that technology. The President is proposing significant fiscal year 1999 increases for key technology programs. For the formula grants to States there is $425 million in fiscal 1997. For competitive grants, $76 million for technology training for teachers. And all of us understand that you have to train the teachers to use the technology in order that it can be used effectively by the students as well in the classroom. The President is proposing increases in each of these areas. I believe it is in the best interest of this country for us to follow his lead in that area. 
The President's $10 billion school construction initiative will also help to provide access to fully-wired, technology-ready facilities for computers, and the Internet can be readily integrated into classrooms. Schools are the last area of our society where technology is really having an impact. It is more prevalent in our homes and in our offices than it is in our schools, and it is time that we fix that problem. 
The final area I want to mention is where I believe the President has made some progress and this Congress has made some progress and we need to keep moving forward in, which is the area of world-class academic standards. Too many schools still offer watered-down academic programs, general education tracks, and low expectations that will not meet the demands of local competition. The President has proposed $200 million in incentives to help districts to set high academic standards, to eliminate the problem of social promotion which he spoke about very eloquently last night, and to take other measures to upgrade the quality of education in our schools. He requested roughly $13 million to pilot and field test a new voluntary national test in reading at the fourth grade level and math at the eighth grade level. This test would be developed by the National Assessment Governing Board, which is not part of the Department of Education. 
Mr. President, these three initiatives--the effort to reduce dropout rates, the effort to provide technology for our schools, and the effort to assist our local schools to achieve world-class academic standards--are all worthy goals for us in this second session of the 105th Congress. I hope very much that we will follow the lead of the President and support these efforts with real resources. We will recognize that our constituents do not want to have us debate and debate and debate about whose responsibility it is to improve the schools. They want to see progress, they want to see improvement, they want to see their children receive a better education. We have the power to do that by continuing what we started in the last session of this Congress--that is, putting more resources into education, giving the priority to education that the President talked about last night. I hope very much we will do that. I believe the President has shown a direction that the American people want to see us follow. And I hope very much we will have the good sense to follow that direction. 
Mr. President, I know there are others who intend to speak. So at this point I yield the floor.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and pay tribute to a teacher in New Mexico who is an excellent example of service and commitment to education and the students of Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
Marshall Floyd has been a teacher at Highland High School since 1953, a member of numerous educational related boards, and has received a wide variety of educational honors, including being the recipient of the Outstanding Biology Teacher of New Mexico by the National Association of Biology Teachers in 1974 and receiving the Science Teacher of the Year Citation from the New Mexico Science Teachers Association in 1981. In 1990, Albuquerque Public Schools named Highland High School's new science building after him in recognition of his service to the school and the educational community. 
Mr. President, on January 12th, the community of Albuquerque and Highland High School paid tribute to this remarkable teacher, and today I join with my fellow New Mexicans in expressing my admiration for Marshall Floyd's continued dedication to educating the students of New Mexico and his commitment to the community of Albuquerque.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as we prepare to complete this first session of the 105th Congress, I want to take a moment to look back at one of the great bipartisan accomplishments that we have made this year, and also to look forward to some important work that still lies ahead. 
I am referring specifically to the work we have been able to do in putting advanced technology to work to improve education in the country. 
Technology and better use of technology is critical in my home State of New Mexico. It is a big State. We have only a few concentrations of population and economic activity, and technology offers us a way to bring communities closer together and offers us a way to eliminate the gaps that separate the `haves' and the `have-nots' in our State and throughout the country. 
In more than half of American households with incomes of over $50,000, the children have access to a computer at home. But in my State the average family earns about $26,000, and in that income range the estimate is that one in four children in those homes will have access to a computer. 
We need to do better in the public sector, Mr. President, in providing technology in our schools so that we can use technology to narrow the gap between the haves and have-nots, rather than to allow that gap to increase. 
In the past year, several magazines have published articles that have challenged the idea that technology in schools can really improve education. The Atlantic Monthly had a cover story called `The Computer Delusion.' There have been articles that consider computers in schools to be `snake oil' or `the filmstrip of the 1990's,' just to cite some of the phrases used. 
Those articles are one reason I was interested in several recent reports that have reviewed the hundreds of research studies on the effects of educational technology on student achievement. The Educational Testing Service [ETS] did a report. Also, there has been a study commissioned by the Software Publishers Association [SPA]. The research results are uneven, but there are solid peer-reviewed studies that show significant improvement in student performance and attitude in all age groups and all subject areas through better use of technology. Overall, technology-based instruction is 30 percent more effective in improving student achievement than instruction that does not include the use of technology. This is the equivalent of about 3 months of additional learning each year for our students. 
The findings of these studies validate the Federal investment in education technology that we have made. I introduced the Technology for Education Act in 1994, and it became law later that year. But when it did become law, I don't believe any of us could have predicted the progress that could have been made in these 3 short years. Let me show you some charts, Mr. President, to indicate the progress that has been made. 
This first chart, I think, makes the case very dramatically. It is a chart that demonstrates computer availability, that is, the students per computer, from the period 1983-84 through this just-completed school year, 1996-97. You can see the dramatic improvement that has occurred. In 1983-84, there were 92 students per computer in our public schools in this country. In this last school year, there were seven students per computer. That is significant progress. Computers have become much more available to students than they ever were before. 
Let me show another chart that is an indicator of the progress that has been made. This is a chart that shows connections to the Internet. It shows how those connections have continued to increase rapidly: 65 percent of schools are now connected to the Internet. That is this green line on the chart. It indicates 65 percent are now connected. Only 14 percent of our classrooms are connected, but that number is also increasing rapidly. Real progress is being made there as well. 
This past summer, the Federal Communications Commission approved plans to implement the universal services fund that will provide schools and libraries with $2.25 billion in communications discounts next year. Thanks to the leadership of Senators Snowe, Rockefeller, Exon, and Kerrey, schools will have affordable access to the Internet over the coming years. 
So looking at these very positive trends, one would think that students are using computers a lot more, but that is not really the case, Mr. President. Let me show you one more chart that indicates the concern I have. 
This is a chart from a recent report by Education Week, a publication entitled `Technology Counts.' It shows that more than half of the eighth grade math students never or hardly ever use computers in their classrooms. Only 12 percent use computers almost every day. In my State, the numbers are even more startling. Two-thirds of the eighth grade math students indicate that they hardly ever use computers; 11 percent in my State indicate that they use computers almost every day. This chart is a graphic depiction of those statistics. 
Another recent report by the CEO Forum, the Chief Executive Officers Forum, supports this same finding. Only 3 percent of schools have fully integrated technology into teaching. 
This means that we're making progress in some places, but that some important barriers are stopping our progress in other schools. 
This past weekend, the Congress passed the spending bill for the Department of Education, and I was privileged to be at the White House this morning when President Clinton signed that bill. It contains significant increases for programs authorized by the bill that I introduced back in 1994. 
Let me show on this final chart that I have here this afternoon some of the increases that we have been able to accomplish in a bipartisan way this year. 
In the technology literacy challenge fund--that is grant money that goes to States and school districts to support better use of technology--in fiscal year 1997, we appropriated $200 million. In the bill signed by the President today that number goes to $425 million. So it is more than twice the amount of funding. 
In the technology innovation challenge grants the figure for 1997 was $57 million. The figure for 1998 is $76 million. 
This year, for the very first time, we have funds earmarked to go specifically to train teachers to use technology more effectively. That is $30 million that was added in by the appropriators, and I think very wisely added. I think we have all begun to recognize that that is an item that needs additional attention. 
This last item is crucially important. We need a balanced investment in technology. Balanced investment in educational technology means more than just buying the right hardware and software, it means investing in the training of the teachers and the administrators to use the software and the hardware. 
Experts say that we should invest 30 percent of our technology budget in training. Nationally, we are investing less than 10 percent in training today. In my State, the estimate is that we are investing less than 5 percent of the funds that go into educational technology in the training of teachers to use that technology. Lack of teacher training will be the biggest barrier that we have to progress in this area. 
This problem is described in a report entitled `Technology and the New Professional Teacher: Preparing for the 21st Century Classroom.' 
That is a report from the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education [NCATE]. They indicate that 2 million new teachers will be hired in the next decade. 
Here is a quote from that report. It says:  
If teachers don't understand how to use technology effectively to promote student learning, the billions of dollars being invested in educational technology initiatives will be wasted. 
Colleges of education clearly need to change the way they train new teachers. And if today's teacher candidates are taught with technology, then they will teach using technology themselves. 
So that is why I introduced earlier in this Congress the Technology for Teachers Act and worked for the $30 million appropriation that I just referred to. Clearly, Senators Harkin and Murray here in the Senate deserve great credit for their support and their advocacy on these issues as well. 
The appropriation will provide competitive grants to States and will support growth and dissemination of the most effective programs for teacher training in the use of technology. 
This $30 million, as I see it, is a downpayment on what will need to be a very long-term investment in tomorrow's teachers. And I intend to work for, at least, a doubling of that in next year's budget. I think that is clearly the direction we need to move in. 
The Federal Government plays an important role in promoting the use of technology in education. But there are obviously other extremely important participants. The States and the school districts are developing challenging new standards. University researchers are discovering diverse ways that people learn. 
The role of the teacher is changing. The teacher is no longer going to be just a lecturer but rather a learning coach to the students. The software industry is developing powerful new learning tools. 
All of these efforts are pieces of a large and complex puzzle. Without a national strategy for coordination of these efforts, and without reliable data on what works, we will never get all of the puzzle's pieces to fit together. 
I am interested in what I read in a recent report from the President's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology [PCAST]. That report stressed the need for more research as we introduce more technology into our schools. We need to study which approaches in this area are most effective, and we need to determine the best investment mixture among hardware, software, training, and other categories. 
As we come to the end of this Congress, I ask my colleagues to join me next year as we build on the progress that has been made here, the very substantial bipartisan progress. We need to take some new steps in promoting education technology. We need to continue our investment, of course, both in computers and in Internet connections. We need to increase substantially the investment in teacher training. And we need to promote new investments in research on the effective use of educational technology. 
The Federal Government can play a crucial role by promoting greater coordination and collaboration among the private sector and university researchers and educators and State and local governments. 
There are several ways to accomplish this. We can do so through a federally funded research and development center, or a consortium of private firms, or a network of universities and schools and companies and agencies. The participants will have to make the final decision as to what mechanism works best. 
The cost of this initiative, like the decisionmaking process, should not be the sole responsibility of the Federal Government. The costs should be shared by all the participants. 
Mr. President, I am proud of the progress that we have made on providing educational technology so it can be used to upgrade education in our schools. And I am very encouraged by the data that shows the first beneficial impacts in our schools, but we have a great deal left to do. The President and many here in Congress deserve credit for the progress that has been made, but obviously their continued effort will be needed in the future. 
The private sector, universities, and educational agencies need to work together to create a new culture of collaboration that will give teachers and their students the full benefit of these new technologies that are being developed. 
Mr. President, on a personal note, I also want to particularly acknowledge the excellent work that David Schindel has done as a fellow in my office throughout the year on this issue of educational technology, as well as several other issues. His accomplishments have been extremely useful to me and I think to the Senate. I appreciate his good work. 
Mr. President, with that I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the situation in which we find ourselves on this bill is a disgrace. The daily newspapers have been filled recently with stories of our developing political confrontation with Saddam Hussein. Just today, Saddam Hussein has ordered all American arms inspectors to leave Iraq immediately, escalating Iraq's crisis with the United Nations and heightening the possibility of a military confrontation. We may well see military action in the Persian Gulf before Congress convenes next year. We all know what that could do to oil markets. Prices might well spike up, right in the middle of the winter heating season. The most effective antidote to such damaging price fluctuations is close communication among the major oil consumption nations, and joint action to calm oil markets through the International Energy Agency [IEA]. Yet the bill before us, once again, fails to make the legal changes that are needed for the United States to continue to participate meaningfully in the IEA. 
The United States took the lead in forming the IEA after the Arab oil embargo of 1973, so that we would never again have to experience the market chaos that reigned at that time. At that time, it seemed that the best way to avoid a repeat of gas lines around the world was through mandatory allocations of world oil supplies. This was basically a command-and-control approach to the problem. This mandatory allocation mechanism was enshrined in our basic law on oil emergencies, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 [EPCA], which also authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and which this bill would extend. But the world has changed since the 1970's. Oil markets have changed dramatically since then. And the mandatory allocation scheme contained in the original EPCA is a dinosaur. 
The United States has taken the lead in designing a flexible international response mechanism to oil supply disruptions that respects market forces. Our domestic oil industry played a key role in the planning process and has endorsed it. We convinced all of the other countries in the IEA to adopt it. But without statutory changes to EPCA, the United States is placed in the absurd position of not being able to participate in the international oil emergency response system that it designed. And all indications from the Persian Gulf are that we could have another emergency sometime soon. 
Why are we in such a predicament? It is not the fault of the administration. They have been pressing for the adoption of the needed legal changes for 3 years now. It is not the fault of this Body. We have passed the requisite legal changes in both the last Congress and in this Congress, and have forwarded them to the other Body. There is no good answer to the question of why the other Body continues to refuse to act on such clearly needed changes. These necessary changes have apparently been made a hostage to other, non-related issues. So we must pass the bill before us today, which is inadequate to our national security needs, or the President will also be without clear legal authorities to operate the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in case of an oil supply emergency. 
I will vote for this bill, Mr. President, with extreme reluctance. But I hope that no one is under the illusion that it advances our energy security. Quite the opposite. The bill sent to us by the other Body will likely reduce our energy security, by inflicting long-term damage on the International Energy Agency. This is because failure of the bill to allow IEA to work with U.S. 
oil companies threatens the future of the Agency. When there are severe supply shortages or market instability, the IEA requires real-time information about the movement and location of oil stocks that only these oil companies can provide. In such a case, this information is shared at the express request of the U.S. Government. But the sharing of this information is normally forbidden under our antitrust laws, so an antitrust exemption of cover information-sharing undertaken at the U.S. Government's request is both needed and justified. 
What is U.S. industry to make of our refusal, for a third time now, to make the appropriate changes to EPCA? I believe that industry will see the passage of this legislation as a signal that the changes to U.S. law needed for their continued participation in the IEA will not be forthcoming in this Congress, if ever. None of us should be surprised, then, when these companies end their cooperation with the IEA and start to reassign the personnel who previously worked on the issues of emergency preparedness and coordination. 
The refusal of the other Body to act on the needed antitrust exemption places the two most important parts of the program of the IEA for 1998 in serious jeopardy. I would like to describe these planned activities in a little detail, which will illustrate how our energy security will be diminished by this bill, even if a crisis in the Persian Gulf does not occur while we are out of session. First, IEA was planning to convene a global conference next year to discuss the coordinated management of emergency oil stocks. For the first time, China, India, and other Asian countries, which will be crucial players in any international oil emergency, would have been represented. This conference will be an important opportunity to convince them to develop their own emergency stockpiles, and will provide a venue for them to learn the practicalities involved in doing so. The U.S. Government has contributed $50,000 towards holding this conference. Without the necessary antitrust exemption, though, the conference will likely be canceled, since the key players with expertise in creating and managing emergency stocks, the oil companies that operate in the United States, are precluded from participating under current law. I don't see how that serves our national interests. Second, the IEA was also planning to hold, in 1998, the first drill in 5 years to exercise its emergency mechanisms. This is important to the smooth functioning of IEA's mechanisms in an actual emergency. In the last 5 years, most of the personnel with knowledge of what actually transpired during the Persian Gulf war on world oil markets have left the scene. It is past time that we have held an exercise to test our present capabilities to handle an emergency. Next year's exercise would also have been the first full test of the revised procedures put in place since the Persian Gulf war. Without the antitrust exemption, this exercise either cannot be held, or it must be limited to exercising only the obsolete IEA procedures for mandatory supply allocation. Industry interest in doing the latter is minimal, so the exercise will in all likelihood be canceled. Such an avoidable development is also not in our national interest. 
If there were legitimate issues being raised by the other Body with respect to the broader legislation that is needed, that would be one thing. Such issues could be worked out in conference. But the only action from the other Body to our requests for the legal changes needed to maintain our energy security, for the past 3 years now, has been to wait until the end of session, to pass a short bill extending the expiration dates in current law, and to leave town. I believe that our country has been poorly served by this inattention to our national security interests.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in the spring, I was asked by the Laymen's National Bible Association to serve as a congressional cochairman for National Bible Week. The goal of the association is to encourage the reading and study of the Bible. I was pleased to agree to do this, and to join the association in announcing that November 23 through 30 of this year has been designated as National Bible Week. As we expect to adjourn before then, I take this opportunity to offer my support for the association's efforts. 
This book, the `Good Book,' has come down to us through the faithful over the centuries. The bedrock of religion for Jews and Christians, it is a boundless source of comfort, hope, action, love, guidance, and inquiry. Some of the most beautiful expressions of human experience, belief and thought are found in the Bible, flowing from the magnificence and grace of God. 
Every day that the Senate is in session, our fine Chaplain, or his designee, offers a prayer drawn from the lessons in the Bible. This is a solemn, wonderful, reliable moment in the daily routine. Reading the book itself is the same.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just comment on the agreement that has been reached on the issue of national tests and is part of the conference report that we are getting ready to vote on. 
After weeks of delay, and essentially a campaign of misinformation waged against voluntary national tests, we now have an agreement that will allow parents to know how their children are really doing in school. And they will be able to know that as soon as the 1999-2000 school year. 
As my colleagues know, people who paid attention on this issue, I have long advocated developing voluntary national education tests. And despite the firestorm of controversy that has erupted here on Capitol Hill in the last week or two, the vast majority of Americans have always thought that this was a good idea. Why should we continue to fumble around in the dark trying to guess what is wrong with our educational system when we can simply turn on the light and see for ourselves? 
For these reasons, I worked with others here in the Senate to negotiate the initial Senate compromise that we approved here by a vote of 87 to 13. I worked with my colleagues to ensure that the Labor-HHS conferees knew how important it was to have new tests that States could use if they chose to as soon as possible. Here on the floor I have done my best to describe the myths and the realities of what national testing is all about. 
As a result, I am glad to report that an agreement on moving forward with developing new tests has been finalized. 
In essence, this new agreement does four things. 
First, it transfers control over development and administration of voluntary national tests to the National Assessment Governing Board. That was part of what we discussed and proposed here in the Senate version of the legislation. And I think that was a very good proposal. So I am very glad to see that in this final bill. 
Second, it calls on the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study about whether it is feasible to link State and commercial tests to the rigorous National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
Third, it allows for development of new national test items aligned with the National Assessment in the areas of 4th grade reading and 8th grade math. 
And, fourth, it eliminates any prohibition against future implementation of the new tests without prior congressional authorization. 
In my view, there are two main benefits to this agreement. 
First, transferring control to this National Assessment Governing Board, NAGB, takes the same approach as the Senate compromise. This ensures that the tests are controlled by an independent and bipartisan agency with a proven record of administering national assessments. 
The second benefit of this agreement is that it removes any explicit requirement for future congressional authorization before implementation of testing. Making sure that the tests are available to be used is one of the most important objectives here. There is no point in having shiny new tests ready and on the shelf if States and districts and parents who want to use those are prohibited from doing so. This agreement puts the burden of blocking any implementation of national tests on those who would oppose States and school districts and parents from using them when they want to. 
In my view, these provisions are all reasonable steps to take. They allow the process to go forward. They establish a level playing field for authorizers and appropriators during any future disputes about the implementation of national tests next year. And they provide reassurances against inventing a wheel that we have already invented before. 
Let me make a few additional statements though about the agreement. 
First, I want to clarify that, in fact, the agreement does allow the development of national testing to go forward this year. The development of fourth grade reading and eighth grade math 
exams based on the National Assessment of Educational Progress will go forward during the upcoming school year. Starting in the next fiscal year, this National Assessment Governing Board can begin piloting and field testing these items, which are necessary steps for implementing the tests in the spring of 2000. 
Second, I would like to lower people's expectations about the proposed study of the feasibility of linking State and commercial tests to this National Assessment. That is because the current hodgepodge of State and commercial tests cannot replace a uniform national test and are almost certainly not comparably vigorous to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. 
Few of the current State tests require more than 10th grade learning levels. The percentage of students who score proficiently in the National Assessment of Education Progress on any given subject is usually much lower than the percentage of students who pass a State exam or a commercial exam. 
A series of studies and reports over the past two decades, have shown that linking State or commercial tests is a costly and an uncertain undertaking. In the end, the National Academy of Sciences study will most likely reiterate the need for a voluntary national test. 
Third, I would like to say that it is unfortunate that the opponents of voluntary national testing did not allow the agreement to include as many protections against discriminatory uses of the tests or bias or other safeguards for poor and minority students as were in the Senate version of the test proposal that we negotiated here. Coming from a State with many poor and minority students, I am committed to ensuring that any new tests are fair to all who take them. 
Overall, I would have to say that this agreement brings us closer to the day when we will have a national yardstick to measure students' academic progress and gauge how well our education system is doing, and not just the system overall, but be able to gauge how the system is doing on a State by State basis or a district by district basis. 
I know that there are those who oppose this effort who still fear that voluntary national tests will undercut local control. I myself would have preferred to move faster than this bill will move us. But I am glad that the commonsense potential of developing these measures now seems clear to all and that we can finally move forward.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that would have a significant impact on two communities within northern New Mexico. The villages of Jemez Springs, and El Rito, NM, are small communities that are completely surrounded by Forest Service land. Despite the fact that their populations are not growing rapidly, they do have some specific land needs; some of which are actually caused by their proximity to national forest land. 
For example, on any given weekend, the Jemez National Recreation Area, within the Santa Fe National Forest will have over 50,000 visitors. Village of Jemez Springs is the only community wholly within the Jemez National Recreation Area. As such, this community of 460 people is often called upon for assistance with emergencies within the national forest. In fact, over 90 percent of the village's fire responses, emergency rescues, and ambulance calls are outside the town limits, placing enormous strain on the village's resources. To help address this problem, in 1996, the State of New Mexico provided funds to Jemez Springs to build a fire substation which would house three emergency vehicles. However, Jemez Springs does not have a suitable location for this facility, nor does the village have the tax base available to buy land for it. 
Mr. President, what this first bill would do is to acknowledge the services that the Santa Fe National Forest currently receives from the village of Jemez Springs, and the additional benefit that a fire substation would provide to visitors to the forest. In recognition of these benefits, my bill would transfer one acre of land to Jemez Springs for use as the site of a fire substation. 
Mr. President, my second bill concerns the venerable customs and religious practices of the people of El Rito, NM. El Rito is a community of a little over 2,000 people nestled within the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. It is a community that has existed for hundreds of years, that is now running out of space. Specifically the El Rito cemetery, where people have buried their dead for generations, is full. As a result, the residents of El Rito must now obtain special permission from the Forest Service in order to bury their family members on Forest Service land that is adjacent to their cemetery. This situation has created what can only be described as an unbecoming bureaucratic burden upon families just at the time that they are grieving. 
To solve this problem, my first thought was to transfer a small portion of land from the Forest Service to El Rito for their cemetery. However despite its age, the community of El Rito is not an incorporated town so the Forest Service would not have a legal public entity to transfer the land to. In order to solve this problem, my bill does not transfer the land, but rather it recognizes the historic nature of this cemetery, and designates five acres of adjacent Forest Service land as special use land for expansion of that cemetery. This will remove the need for the residents of El Rito to obtain a special use permit each time someone dies. 
Mr. President, I think all of the New Mexico delegation realizes that both of the problems addressed by these bills need to be resolved. In fact, the House has passed a bill concerning these two issues which was originally sponsored by former Representative Richardson, and is currently sponsored by Representative Redmond. However in response to concerns raised by the Forest Service, the bill as passed by the House would require these small communities to either exchange land of equal value or pay for these lands. Mr. President I think the reality here is that being surrounded by Forest Service land, that it will be next to impossible for these communities to find land of equal value to exchange. These communities also do not have the financial resources for outright purchases of property. 
I believe that the way my two bills are written can meet the concerns of the Forest Service and still resolve the underlying problems these communities are facing. I am committed to working with other Members of the delegation to move this legislation as quickly as possible. 
Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that these two bills be entered into the Record.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. Presdient, I rise today to introduce the Quality Teacher in Every Classroom Act, a bill to ensure quality and accountability in Federal efforts to improve public school teaching. 
Let me begin by stating that I am a strong supporter of the hard-working teachers in American classrooms. Coming from a family of teachers, I know first-hand how challenging the work is. Having visited schools throughout my home State of New Mexico, I know how dedicated and professional the vast majority of our teachers are. And any time you talk to students, the conversation always comes back to teachers. 
However, it's also pretty clear that we are not doing anyone--neither teachers nor students--a great service by putting so many under-qualified teachers in American classrooms, and providing so little support to teachers and the institutions that prepare and support them. 
Too often, our teachers lack enough background in their subjects, our colleges of education are not rigorous enough, our state licensing standards are too low, and local districts have too few high-quality candidates to choose from. 
Improving teaching quality won't solve all of our educational problems, but it is at the heart of what goes on in individual classrooms around the nation. And as shown on the following charts, the state and national statistics are alarming. None of us is doing as much as is needed to improve teaching quality: 
As this first chart shows, most States have a long way to go in promoting teaching quality. In the 1997 Education Week national report card called `Quality Counts,' none of the States received an `A', and most received `C's.' 
Like many other States, New Mexico received a `C-minus' for teaching quality in this report because--while the State does require national certification for all its schools of education: Only 52 percent of NM high school teachers have degrees in their subject areas; the State does not require that teachers have a degree in liberal arts (math, science, history, etc.); and fewer than three-fourths of NM teachers who participated in professional development received some form of support to do so. 
As a Nation, we are unfortunately actually doing worse over all as the 1990's have progressed. The just-released 1997 Goals report showed that the percentage of high school teachers with a degree in their subject area actually declined over all from 66 percent in 1990 to 63 percent in 1994. For New Mexico, the percentage has remained near the bottom, at 52 percent. 
For New Mexico students, that means that it's about a 50-50 chance whether their teachers have a strong background in the area they are teaching. 
And the situation is particularly bleak in the key areas of math and science, where we need to be at our best. 
This second chart shows the latest data showing that nearly one in three high school math teachers lacks a math degree. In New Mexico, the percentage was 36 percent, and in other states over half the math teachers lack even a minor in math. 
This next charts shows a similar story in the area of high school science. Nearly one in four high school science teachers lacks a science degree. In most states, over 20 percent of the high school science teachers lack that background. It's worth noting that in this area New Mexico fares better than most States, at only 19 percent. 
More than 50,000 people are teaching America's children without the minimal training required to meet professional standards. In schools with the highest minority enrollments, minority students have less than a 50% chance of sitting in the class of a math or science teacher with a degree in that field. 
From talking to teachers, however, I know that it's they more than anyone else who want our public schools to be improved so that children to learn as much as they can. And that's important, because improving and maintaining the quality of America's teaching force is on the mind of every policy maker today. Clearly, all our efforts at raising curriculum and testing standards for children will be severely diluted without the powerful presence of a competent instructor in each classroom. 
More than anything else, the public is demanding properly prepared teachers. A properly prepared teacher in every classroom is a reasonable demand. And the federal government, which has for too long talked about improving teaching without doing anything about it, needs to become a leader in this area. That's what this legislation is all about. 
Now I want to be the first to acknowledge that I am not the only one interested in this issue. Senators Kennedy, Reed, Frist, and others have already introduced teacher training legislation, much of it based on the 1996 findings of the National Commission on Teaching and Learning. And I know that the Chairman of the Labor Committee is extremely interested in this issue. I look forward to working with all of them as the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act continues. 
However, this legislation, called the Quality Teacher in Every Classroom Act, is distinctive in several regards. Most importantly, this is the only Senate proposal that provides a thorough formula for reform in teacher training. The legislation addresses the problem comprehensively, and leverages as much improvement as possible given the limited Federal investment in education. 
Let me take a moment to describe its main features, which are outlined on the chart summarizing the bill. 
First, the Act would take the simple step of making sure that parents have available to them important information about the basic qualifications and academic background of their children's teachers. 
Teachers are professionals just like the family doctor or the local lawyer, and so their backgrounds should be just as available as if their diplomas were framed on the wall. I believe that the availability of this information will engage and empower parents in advocating for improved schools. 
Second, the Act calls on states to reduce the percentage of teachers who are uncertified or lack a sufficient academic background. States must make zero tolerance for poorly prepared teachers their number one priority. 
This bill gives them five years to reduce substantially the number of unlicensed teachers as well as those who are teaching outside of their area of expertise. It also requires them to accept any teacher from another area who has national certification as a master teacher as fully qualified to teach in that state. 
Next, the Act calls on colleges of education to make substantial changes in the preparation that they provide teaching candidates, including graduating more students who will pass state teacher licensing exams and requiring a rigorous liberal arts major in an academic subject area, which is not uniformly required. 
In addition, the Act will address the lack of high-quality teachers and teaching candidates in our most poverty-stricken schools by providing financial incentives for highly qualified teaching candidates. For each year they taught in high-need areas, new teachers would have their school loans forgiven. And experienced teachers who pursue advanced work such as national certification or Advanced Placement training would also qualify for loan forgiveness. 
This incentive should bring new energy and talent to poor communities, inspiring students and instilling parents with renewed confidence in their children's schools. 
Finally, the bill would help improve the recruitment and support provided for new teachers by creating a competitive grant program to fund partnerships among colleges of education, school districts, and schools. 
Each member of the partnership including a school district, a school that includes at least 30% children who meet criteria for poverty, and a university or college that offers teacher preparation. Special priority would be given to applications that used or created laboratory or `teaching' schools with their partner districts, where teaching candidates learn hands-on. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am excited to introduce a bill that brings together so many of the legislative agendas I have been promoting for many years: rigorous standards, constructive support for those who are failing to meet those standards, and a comprehensive approach to solving central problems of American public life.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Veteran's Day is an appropriate occasion to honor those who have served our Nation so nobly. I'd like to take this occasion to offer special recognition to New Mexico's most distinguished veterans, our living Medal of Honor winners. Col. Robert Scott, who celebrates his 84th birthday this month, is a longtime resident of Santa Fe, NM, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroic deeds during World War II. Cpl. Hiroshi Miyamura, from Gallup, NM, was honored for his bravery as an infantryman during the Korean war. Second Lt. Raymond Murphy, a resident of Albuquerque, served heroically with the U.S. Marine Corps during that conflict. Sgt. Louis Richard Rocco, also from Albuquerque, celebrating his 59th birthday this month, received the Medal for his courageous deeds as a medic during the Vietnam war. New Mexico and the Nation are proud of these fine men and deeply grateful for their contributions to the freedom enjoyed by all Americans. 
Since the birth of our Nation in 1776, 40 million American men and women have bravely sacrificed and served in defense of the freedoms that we enjoy, perhaps even sometimes take for granted. But our freedom isn't free, it was bought and paid for with the sacrifices of more than 1 million of those heroic servicemen and women who gave their lives for God and country. It was our first President who cautioned a young nation that, `If we desire peace, it must be known that we are at all times prepared for war.' 
Time and again in our 220-year history, our Nation's sons and daughters have been called upon to demonstrate that preparedness. Perhaps in no other war, however, was their resolve more tested than when our Nation struggled within itself during the Civil War. Early in that conflict, Iowa Senator James W. Grimes realized that soldiers needed not only leadership, they needed role models--heroes to look up to and emulate. To accomplish this, he introduced to this body, legislation authorizing a Medal of Honor for sailors and marines who distinguished themselves by their gallantry in action, in order to `promote the efficiency of the navy.' Six months after President Lincoln authorized the Navy's Medal of Honor on December 21, 1861, he signed similar legislation introduced by Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson to establish a Medal of Honor for members of the U.S. Army. 
Since it was established by the Senate and authorized by President Lincoln 136 years ago, the Medal of Honor has been awarded to only 3,408 veterans of military service. The `roll call' of heroes includes an 11-year-old Civil War naval cabin boy, an escaped slave, the sons of two Presidents, conscientious objectors, privates and generals, chaplains and medics, and members of the U.S. Senate. These heroes have come from 
every State in the Union, from all nationalities and ethnic backgrounds, and from all social and economic strata. Three other Medal of Honor winners hail from New Mexico--about whom we are equally proud; Richard Rocco, Raymond Murphy, and Hiroshi Miyamura. Each of these men, and all winners of this coveted award have one thing in common, an action of such remarkable heroism `above and beyond the call of duty at the risk of their own life', that their comrades in arms have called them `heroes.' 
World War I gave us 119 Medal of Honor heroes, men like Eddie Rickenbacker and Sgt. Alvin York. But when the armistice was signed concluding the `war to end all wars' at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918, all America prayed that there would be no need to extend the honor of Medal of Honor recipient to future generations, a distinction that could be achieved only as a result of U.S. involvement in a war. 
Sadly, this would not be the case. Since that first `Veterans Day', subsequent tyranny and human rights violations around the world have continued to test the commitment of our Nation's men and women in uniform. In the horror and devastation of the battles to defend freedom and human dignity since World War I, more than 30 million Americans have risked everything. All who served were heroes in their own right, and to each of them we owe our thanks, our thoughts and our prayers this Veterans Day. Of this multitude of patriots, only 811 received the Medal of Honor. So incredible were their acts of courage that only 316 of them survived to wear this highest honor. 
It is often said that the youth of our Nation today need real heroes, men and women of patriotism and integrity, examples of sacrifice and service; that they can look up to and emulate. We who are of generations past can lament the loss of great Americans such as Sgt. York, Jimmie Doolittle, Audie Murphy, and other heroes of our childhood. But I am happy to report that today there are still many heroes and heroines in our land, men and women who embody the principles and character that have created and preserved the United States. Among those role models are the millions of veterans that we honor today, and among those veterans of military service are 168 surviving Medal of Honor heroes. Today, as we honor all our Nation's veterans, I would like to pay special homage to our New Mexican Medal of Honor winners. 
On November 30, 1913, Robert Sheldon Scott was born here in the Nation's capital. His family later moved to California where Bob Scott attended school before moving again to my own State of New Mexico. Bob Scott answered his Nation's call to duty to serve during World War II. 
On June 30, 1943, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Adm. William Halsey launched `Operation Cartwheel', a bold two-pronged offensive to gain control of Rabul in the Pacific. On the day, Admiral Halsey landed the 43rd Infantry Division on the New 
Georgia in the Solomon Islands for the purpose of capturing the Japanese-held Munda airstrip. Underestimating the jungles of the island and the tenacity of its Japanese defenders, Halsey expected the campaign to last only 2 weeks. By mid-July the Admiral was forced to land two more divisions on the island, and the attack on the airstrip resumed with new fervor on July 25. More than 1,000 Americans would give up their lives in the effort. 
By July 27, the 43d Infantry's 172d Regiment bogged down in front of a salient facing the Munda airstrip. Battle-weary and demoralized from 27 days of bitter fighting, the well-entrenched enemy seemed to have again halted the advance. Two days later, a squad from the 172d's 1st Battalion again assaulted the hill. Young Army Lt. Robert Scott led his men halfway up the hill to a position within 75 yards of the enemy, when the Japanese counterattack stopped them. Enemy soldiers rose from their fortifications firing their rifles and throwing grenades. Their fierce attack threw the exhausted Americans off the hill. Except for Lieutenant Scott. 
Ducking behind the blasted remains of a tree stump, the brave lieutenant had an unobstructed view of the enemy bunkers. Despite being twice wounded and once having his rifle shot from his hand, for the next half hour, Lieutenant Scott stood alone on the hill to repulse the enemy. Throwing some 30 grenades, his one-man stand ended the enemy assault and caused them to withdraw. His Medal of Honor citation concludes with the notation that `our troops, inspired to renewed effort by Lieutenant Scott's intrepid stand and incomparable courage, swept across the plateau to capture the hill, and from this strategic position, four days later, captured Munda airstrip.' 
Of his award, Mr. Scott recently wrote, `I was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II for deeds one day as a Second Lieutenant infantry platoon leader, deeds that I initiated at least in part from the conviction that I ought to have enough guts to do what I was authorized to order a sergeant or private soldier to try to do.' 
Today, Bob Scott still lives in the town of his youth, Santa Fe, NM. He is one of four of my State's living Medal of Honor heroes. The ninth oldest of our Nation's living Medal of Honor recipients, on the 30th day of this month, he will celebrate his 84th birthday. Our Governor, the Honorable Gary Johnson, has declared that day to be `Colonel Robert Scott Day' throughout our State. 
Other Medal of Honor recipients from New Mexico contributed similar deeds of valor. Corporal Miyamura of Gallup was with Company H holding a defensive position near Taejon-ni, Korea in April 1951. When the enemy began to overrun his position, Corporal Miyamura left his sheltered position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, then returned to his position to 
tend to the wounded. Under attack again, Corporal Miyamura manned two machine-guns to provide covering fire while his squad withdrew. He killed more than 50 enemy soldiers before his ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded. 
Second Lt. Raymond Murphy served as a platoon commander of Company A, 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division in action against the enemy west of Panmunjom, Korea. Wounded by artillery fire, Lieutenant Murphy refused medical aid while leading his men up a well-defended hill through a withering barrage of enemy fire. Murphy rescued many of his fallen comrades and returned each time to lead the assault and provide cover for his troops. While all the wounded evacuated and the assaulting units began to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine to cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill. After reaching the base of the hill, he organized a search party and again ascended the slope for a final check on missing Marines, locating and carrying the bodies of a machine-gun crew down the hill. Wounded a second time, he again refused medical assistance until he was certain that all of his men had been safely evacuated. 
Sgt. Louis Richard Rocco of Albuquerque served in Vietnam as a medic northeast of Katum. While evacuating wounded comrades, Sergeant Rocco directed fire against the enemy to enable a helicopter to land and assist in the operation. In the battle, the helicopter was disabled by enemy fire and crashed. Sergeant Rocco continued to direct covering fire while personally extracting survivors from the helicopter and carrying them to safety through dense foliage and enemy fire. 
It is said, `Poor is the nation that has no heroes or heroines, but beggard is the nation that has and forgets them.' On this day, our Nation has set aside to remember our veterans, as I stand before the same body that established the Medal of Honor, I offer this special salute to Col. Robert S. Scott, Cpl. Hiroshi H. Miyamura, 2d Lt. Raymond G. Murphy, and Sgt. Louis Richard Rocco--great citizens of the State of New Mexico and the Nation.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of this year's national defense authorization bill which was reported out of conference committee. 
The bill is the product of many months of dedicated work by Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin and many others here, and of course, the committee staff and personal staff of Senators as well. It reflects the collective interests of the Congress. It includes many provisions that were arrived at through many long weeks and even months of debating and negotiating. 
I want to call particular attention to the provisions to fully fund the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program and the related Department of Energy programs to secure the nuclear materials and destroy chemical stockpiles and strategic weapons in the former Soviet Union. In my view, the money spent on these programs is among the most cost-effective ways that we expend taxpayer money to pursue our own national security and to promote international peace. 
I am also pleased that there is significant funding in this bill authorized for a range of dual-use research and development programs. I believe that is important and allows the Department of Defense to leverage commercial investment in advanced technologies to meet our defense needs. 
The bill also authorizes funding to meet the requirements of the defense programs in the Department of Energy, particularly the Stockpile Stewardship Program, which I believe is extremely important to the future of our country. 
The bill also contains, and I am sure others have commented on this, a 2.8 percent pay raise for active duty military members. Without this bill, that increase would be limited to 2.3 percent. This may seem like a small amount, but I believe that for people in uniform it is an important difference and one that we should definitely adopt this bill to accomplish. 
The bill also, of course, is essential if we are going to go forward with the construction programs for the fiscal year 1998 military construction projects, and that is another reason why the bill should be approved by this Senate and should be signed by the President. 
Mr. President, this bill does not meet all the goals of individual Senators, but it does express the collective priorities 
of the Senate, and I urge that we move to adopt it and send it to the President for his signature. I hope the President will recognize the value of this legislation to the Nation and sign it into law. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know the Senator from California is waiting to speak.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me talk separately about two issues. One is this Senate resolution disapproving the cancellations that were transmitted by the President resulting in this S. 1292. 
Let me first indicate the reasons that I support the resolution, and then I will say a few things about the line-item veto issue, the larger issue that the Senator and others have been discussing here. First, I do support the legislation, S. 1292, for the simple reason that I believe the administration acted to cancel worthy projects on the basis of erroneous information and that it is our duty in the Congress to override that decision if we have the votes to do that. The administration has admitted as much to us in a statement that we received today, and the President continues to insist that he will not allow the passage of this resolution to be signed into law. 
At a minimum, I believe that if this override effort proves unsuccessful, the administration owes it to the military personnel in the country and to their families and to those of us in Congress to ensure that there is funding provided for the projects that were incorrectly included in the President's line-item veto package. The Senate received a statement from the administration today indicating that some military construction projects that the President vetoed were canceled on the basis of erroneous information. Mr. President, that is exactly what happened on the two projects that I am most familiar with, the two in New Mexico. The project at Kirtland Air Force Base and White Sands Range. 
In both of those cases, we had information from the Department of Defense indicating that those projects had been substantially designed, and they were ready to be executed in this fiscal year, and as such, they did not meet this criteria that the President has indicated he used and the Office of Management and Budget used in deciding which items to line-item veto. 
In fact, I had a conversation with Franklin Raines, head of the Office of Management and Budget, on the day that the decision was announced by the President, and I discussed with him the information we have received from the Department of Defense and how it conflicted with the information that he had which he was urging the President to use in making the decision. 
So I am persuaded that the decision as to those two projects was based on erroneous information. I believe, based on what the President has indicated in his letter to us, that the decisions on many other projects were also based on erroneous information. So I believe it is in our best interest and it is our duty, in fact, to go ahead and pass this legislation. I intend to vote for it. 
Let me say a couple words about the line-item veto itself. I am not one who supported the line-item veto legislation. I opposed it for many of the reasons that the Senator from West Virginia has articulated so well here on the Senate floor. First of all, I don't believe it is good policy. I think the Founding Fathers had it right when they determined that this was not a power that should be granted to the President, and so I support the basic structure that was put into our Constitution. 
Second, if we were going to try to enact some type of line-item veto and grant that authority to the President, it cannot be done by statute; we would have to amend the Constitution. We would have to go through the very elaborate procedure set up in the Constitution to amend the Constitution. Clearly, that was not done in this legislation. 
Let me also say that all the debate over the last several years in the Congress about the line-item veto has been an effort to describe it as something which was needed in order to impose fiscal responsibility on the Government. My experience here in the Congress has led me to conclude that fiscal irresponsibility is just as much a result of action in the executive branch as it is a result of action here in the Congress. There are many instances where those of us in Congress are fiscally irresponsible. I have witnessed that on many occasions. But I have also witnessed many examples where the executive branch and the President in the budget sent to the Congress were also fiscally irresponsible. So I don't think the case has been made that fiscal irresponsibility is just a province of the Congress. 
I do believe we should pass this resolution. I believe that the Supreme Court, when it gets the opportunity, will declare the legislation that enacts the line-item veto to be unconstitutional. I believe the issue will be back before us at that time to see whether we want to do a constitutional amendment. I will urge my colleagues not to do a constitutional amendment at that time. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. I appreciate the time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes this morning to debunk a few myths that are being spread about how the Senate voluntary national testing plan would work and explain why a so-called compromise that has been discussed here in the Capitol in the last few days misses the mark almost entirely. 
As many of my colleagues here in the Senate already know, the opponents of a voluntary national test are blocking what in my view is a reasonable and carefully crafted proposal to improve our schools. Over a month ago here in the Senate, we voted 87 to 13 in support of this proposal. Since then, the opponents of it have refused to even sit down at the table and talk about the issue. In fact, they have threatened to shut down the Federal Government again rather than to allow States and school districts and parents to decide for themselves whether or not they want to use these new tests. 
In recent weeks, the opponents of voluntary national testing have tried to spread a series of myths about the proposal that was passed by the Senate. Many of these are described on the chart here. Let me just go through a few of them. 
First of all, one of the myths is that this is `just another test.' In reality, these national tests would provide essential information to parents that none of the commercial tests presently available provide, by allowing a comparison. The tests that are being considered by us in this legislation would allow a comparison between students across the Nation as to their level of performance on reading in the fourth grade and mathematics at the eighth grade. 
Another myth is that the tests are not voluntary. The claim is that they are not voluntary. In fact, we have written into the language of the bill a specific requirement that they be voluntary; a prohibition against any impediment or any force being put on a State or district or community that chooses not to use the tests. 
Another of the myths is that they would not do anything, when in reality we have various States and communities and school districts around the Nation that are showing that high standards and uniform measures of achievement can engage and empower area communities to put more emphasis on their schools and increase the learning that occurs there. 
But, despite the mischaracterizations of the voluntary testing proposal, I am glad to report that educators and business leaders and the American public support this proposal overwhelmingly, the proposal that the President sent forward. I know this from having heard it from people on the front lines. 
This last Friday we had a meeting with various people. An elementary school parent and PTA member, Laura Scott, told about how important independent tests were for parents who are handing their children over to schools and need all the leverage they can get to make sure the education their children are getting in those schools is adequate. Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado spoke about the efforts that are being made in Colorado to develop their tests in these various subjects and how he would appreciate a chance to know how his State is doing relative to other States. He could not see any justification for each of the 50 States having to reinvent the wheel. Obviously, the President's proposal would eliminate the need for that. The Governor of North Carolina, Jim Hunt, also spoke eloquently about the importance of having benchmarks so that he can determine the appropriateness of the education that is being provided to his own grandchildren in the public schools of North Carolina. 
From a business perspective, Alan Wurtzel, of the National Alliance of Business, and Chris Larson, of the Technology Network, described how important uniform measures of achievement are to preparing a qualified work force for the 21st century and how the business community insists upon objective measurements of achievement in the training that they do. And they believe that same concept makes a lot of sense in our schools as well. 
Representing large, urban school districts, Philadelphia School Superintendent David Hornbeck said that the tests, as he saw it, would be, and the phrase he used was a `sword of equality' for poor and minority students in Philadelphia and elsewhere who today are receiving an inferior education, unfortunately, in many of these school systems but, by virtue of this kind of objective performance testing, would be able to improve the situation. 
Most recently, opponents of the voluntary national tests came up with the so-called compromise proposal that in my view reveals a basic misunderstanding about what the voluntary national testing proposal is supposed to do. The proposed compromise preserves the status quo. It relies on a type of test --the type which many of our school districts are now using--which creates the impression that students are doing better than they really are. We could refer to this proposal as the Lake Woebegone proposal. It is clearly a situation, which we have today, where `all the children are above average.' 
First off, the compromise they are proposing is not much 
different from an outright prohibition on the development of any new tests. Further development of a voluntary national test would be immediately and completely prohibited under this compromise, so-called compromise, that has been discussed. That is nothing else but protecting the status quo, in denying States, denying school districts the choice to participate in a national measure of student achievement. Seven States have already indicated they want to participate and 15 major school districts have opted to do so. 
Second, this proposed compromise wouldn't really accomplish anything useful in terms of focusing more attention on world-class standards for all children. That is because instead of developing new national tests on fourth grade reading and eighth grade math, this antitesting proposal would fund a $3 million study of the feasibility of linking various commercial tests that are already there with each other. These commercial tests that would be linked under this study do not conform to the rigorous academic standards of the National Assessment of Educational Progress. The whole idea behind this development of a fourth grade reading test and eighth grade math test is we want these kinds of rigorous national academic standards that are reflected in the National Assessment of Educational Progress available for all schools to look at. 
In addition, the tests that would be studied are all `norm-referenced' tests, which means their scores are all reported by percentiles. They show how you scored compared to others, but they do not show how you score relative to any kind of objective criteria, as to whether or not you can read at a reasonable level or do math at a reasonable level. 
In many ways, this proposal misses the point. It suggests that the current hodgepodge of commercial tests can adequately solve the problem. It proposes to preserve the status quo rather than allowing States and districts to make their own choices. It undercuts the National Assessment for Educational Progress which is the most rigorous national measure of student achievement. And this so-called compromise is completely unsatisfactory in that it would block the proposal we agreed to here in the Senate, to allow this test to be developed by the National Assessment Governing Board. 
Here in the Senate, the compromise that was negotiated, it was clear, was supported overwhelmingly by a bipartisan group of Senators. Leading scholars in this field such as Checker Finn and Bill Bennett supported that compromise. Since then, 43 Senators have pledged to block the appropriations bill or to uphold a veto, if the President is required to veto the bill, if that original compromise is not maintained. 
So, if testing opponents want the National Academy of Sciences to study whether commercial or even State-developed tests are as rigorous as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, I have no problem with that. I think studies can sometimes be useful. But until it is clear that State and commercial tests are up to the task, I believe we should be able to go ahead with the voluntary national test development and that funding should be kept in the bill and not be prohibited as the House is considering doing. 
Mr. President, I know there are others waiting to speak. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act of 1998. 
Boosting the strength of our R&D infrastructure is crucially important to the future health and prosperity of every inhabitant of my home State of New Mexico, just as it is to every American. The scientific, technical, and medical advances of the past 40 years have dramatically improved our standard of living. If we are to maintain these advances into the future, we cannot afford to stand still. 
Unfortunately, we are now headed in the wrong direction. Federal funding for research and development has declined as an overall percentage of the Federal budget over the last 20 years. We now spend less than 2 cents of each dollar of Federal spending on science and engineering research and development. We need to do better. It is clear that if we want to create the kind of high-paying, high-technology jobs that will ensure a decent standard of living for American workers, we will need a much stronger commitment to investing in research and development. 
Although the focus of this bill is ensuring a strong future for civilian R&D, it is important to recognize that the basic science and fundamental technology development supported by the Defense portion of our budget also contributes to our domestic prosperity. For our Nation to remain prosperous into the next century, we need both sources of support for basic science and fundamental technology to remain strong, even in a time of constrained budgets. 
There was a time when our investment in research and development equaled that of the rest of the world combined. But through the years, we have allowed our commitment to slide, and have lost much ground compared to our international competitors. Mr. President, this is not where we want to be, and I hope that the National Research Investment Act of 1998 will put us on the path to a better future.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Dropout Prevention Act. I will talk just a bit about the issue and talk about the problem that I am trying to address and that this act is intending to address. It is a problem, I think, all Senators should join me in trying to resolve and I believe will join me in trying to resolve. 
We have a serious problem on our hands that is a threat to the youth of America. The problem is that far too many of our kids are dropping out of high school before they graduate. Some, even, are dropping out of middle school before they proceed on to high school. 
Each fall, starting about a month ago, students begin dropping out of school and they drop out in very, very large numbers. Nationwide, nearly half a million kids leave school each year. That is, leaving school not by graduating but leaving school early and deciding not to stay in school and graduate. That is 2,700 dropouts for each school day. Studies show that our children are dropping out at a younger and younger age. 
Who are these kids who are dropping out of school? The charts that I have here make the case fairly well. They are largely from low-income and middle-income families, and as a percent they are largely minority. The numbers are disturbing across the board, but they are particularly alarming for Hispanic students. 
First, on the income level. If you look at this chart, the top line shows the period from 1975 to 1995, a 20-year period. On the left-hand side we show the dropout rates for grades 10-12, ages 15-24, by family income. What this means is that among students from low-income families at times it has been as high as 17 percent that have dropped out in a particular year. In middle-income families, it is closer to 6 to 8 percent, and in high-income families it is substantially lower than that. When you break it down not just by income level but by ethnic background, you can see that the problem is concentrated and particularly alarming for Hispanic students who are dropping out at a rate more than double that of non-Hispanic students. Also, black students drop out at a rate about 50 percent higher than the rate for white students. 
You can see from this chart the point I am making here, the top line, the red line, represents the percentage of Hispanic students dropping out. This is called status dropout rates for persons 16-24, and you can see somewhere between 30 and 35 percent of Spanish students nationwide drop out rather than compete high school. It is a very serious problem, particularly in that group, and of course that is a great concern in my State where a very large percent of the student population is Hispanic. 
Why are they dropping out? With all the emphasis on self-reliance these days it is tempting to ask what is wrong with kids that so many of them are leaving school. When you actually sit down and talk to these young people, as I have done across New Mexico, you soon learn that it is not the kids that are failing the schools as much as it is the schools that are failing our young people. Ask groups of high school students why they and their friends are leaving school and you will hear the same answers again and again. Some of them are bored with the dumbed-down lessons that they don't see as having any relevance to their own lives. They are lost in giant school buildings with endless corridors and teachers who have very little time to give them or to use in encouraging them to succeed in their school work. They are trapped in an educational system that does not meet the individual needs of individual students. 
With all the focus on education these days you would think this issue would be getting substantial attention but, in fact, it is not getting any real attention. It has been 8 years since President Bush and the Nation's Governors established as a national goal that we would graduate 90 percent of high school seniors by the year 2000. Obviously, we are much closer to the year 2000, but we are nowhere near the goal of graduating 90 percent of our students before they drop out of school. 
Now, let's talk a little about the bill we are introducing, this National Dropout Prevention Act of 1997. This is the only comprehensive effort that we have seen, that we have come up with, or that we are aware of anyone coming up with, that will prevent students from dropping out of school and take this issue head on. 
Let me outline the proposal very briefly. First, two basic points. The reasons that kids drop out of school cut across racial and ethnic lines. The solutions we are proposing are aimed at helping all at-risk students make it through high school. Second, the emphasis here is on preventing students from dropping out of school by reforming the schools that they are in rather than trying to help students later after they have made the decision to leave school. 
But what I am proposing in this bill sets out to achieve four basic goals: 
First, to focus greater national attention on the problem and to coordinate our Federal efforts to deal with the issue. 
Second, to provide more resources to help communities to fight back at this problem. 
Third, to enable school districts to try effective prevention strategies that have been shown to work. 
Fourth, to enlist the States where most of the resources are and most of the policy is related to education in the effort to keep more kids in school. 
The bill directs the President to appoint a dropout czar within the Department of Education who would coordinate efforts at the national level, would streamline programs, would recommend changes and, most importantly, could be held accountable for progress on dropout prevention. This czar would make sure that existing Federal programs such as the Upward Bound Program and vocational education do their level best to help at-risk kids to complete high school. 
Second and third, this bill creates a new $100 million grant program to reach the 1,000 schools across the country with the highest dropout rates. With these funds, schools would be able to try proven strategies that have been shown to work--strategies like breaking larger schools down into smaller learning communities so that kids can have regular and closer contact with the adults in the school, particularly with their teachers, and can have challenging and relevant work to do. 
Finally, because States are so much a part of our educational system, we would ask them to place a greater emphasis on dropout prevention as well. We have asked in this bill that instead of awarding education dollars based on how many students are enrolled in school 40 days into the year, as my State does and as many States do, the States change their laws so that they monitor enrollment levels throughout the school year. Because gathering accurate data is the first step toward fixing the problem, we also ask that States keep track of who is leaving school. 
Let me show you a chart. This chart takes the 23 States that presently collect data on the number of students dropping out of school and it ranks them. It shows that, according to the statistics we have, as a percentage dropout rate, New Mexico --and this is on an annual basis--ranks third in the country. Each Senator can look at this list and determine very quickly, first, whether his or her State collects data on this subject and, second where his or her State ranks in dealing with the problem. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, let me just summarize what our bill does. It coordinates the Federal dropout prevention initiatives; it streamlines the unconnected and overlapping dropout prevention programs; it provides additional Federal resources for dropout prevention programs at the State level and local school district level; it targets and expands participation by at-risk students in the programs, and it calls on State and local agencies to coordinate and expand their own efforts. 
Mr. President, this is a difficult problem. It is one that we are not going to solve by waving some magic wand. The effort will demand a concerted effort, a real commitment by State and local leaders, parents, educators and, of course, students. But if the issue is not placed on the national agenda and done so immediately, our chances of meeting this 90 percent graduation target any time in the near future will be greatly diminished. Clearly, it will be impossible to meet that by the year 2000. But, hopefully, we can meet it some time in the next decade if we get about the business of trying to do so. 
This legislation is being introduced, Mr. President, with the hope that we can begin to educate others in the Congress about the seriousness of the problem, begin to educate others in the country about the seriousness of the problem. I hope we can get colleagues to cosponsor the legislation and that we can move toward hearings on the bill some time in the Labor and Human Resources Committee early after we reconvene in the second session of this Congress.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Power Act Amendments of 1997. This bill streamlines the Federal regulation of electric power and helps reduce costs for all factories, businesses, and homeowners. The changes in Federal regulation in this bill will also yield savings for consumers by providing new opportunities for competition in the wholesale market for electric power. 
This bill improves the way the Federal Government regulates electric power to achieve three important goals. First, it will facilitate the ongoing transition to more competitive and efficient markets. Second, it will assure the continued reliability of the transmission system that carries the power in interstate commerce. And third, it will remove Federal regulatory ambiguities and barriers for those States that elect to give customers a choice in selecting their energy provider. Very importantly, my bill leaves for the States the issues that are best dealt with at that level and provides for Federal authority only over issues raising a clear national interest. 
In the last 9 months the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has conducted seven workshops that helped bring forward many of the complex electric power issues facing State and Federal regulators. The debate today remains centered on whether or not the Federal Government should require the utilities in every State to implement competition at the retail level. There are, however, other important issues that underlie this central debate. These include the possible repeal of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act, known as PURPA; changes in the Public Utility Holding Company Act, known to everyone here as PUHCA; and the treatment of past investments in powerplants that may no longer be economical, so called stranded costs, to name just a few. 
Our electric power industry has a strong regional and local character with over 3,000 individual utilities, including investor-owned, municipal, Federal, and rural cooperatives. Several comprehensive bills have now been introduced in the House and Senate that promise to deregulate the Nation's electric power industry. Meanwhile, a number of individual States are moving forward with retail competition. 
However, in list of the vast difference in the circumstance of 3,000 individual utility companies, it is going to be difficult to develop a consensus on comprehensive Federal legislation. If comprehensive electricity legislation does not move forward, I believe Congress must still address a number of important issues that can only be dealt with at the Federal level. I'd like to take a moment to explain what these issues are and how my bill differs from proposals that require retail competition for all electric utility customers. 
Madam President, our electric power industry is made up of three main components: Powerplants that generate the power, high-voltage transmission lines that carry the power over long distances, and the local distribution systems that bring the power into our homes and businesses. Most of the other bills would require States to deregulate their utilities and implement retail competition. Still, for all the talk about deregulation, I hope everyone realizes they are talking about deregulating, only the first piece: The powerplants that use coal, natural gas, or other sources to generate the energy on which we all depend. 
The other two components of the industry, the transmission and local distribution systems, will remain regulated monopolies. 
My bill takes a very different approach. It is not a restructuring bill. It will not overturn the established division between State and Federal regulation, and it does not require States to implement retail competition by a date certain. Rather, my bill forges new ground in the debate by focusing on the middle piece of the electric utility industry: The interstate transmission grid that is the critical link between generators and consumers. The transmission system clearly involves interstate commerce with a distinct national interest that can only be addressed at the Federal level. 
Let me explain why it is important that we streamline the Federal regulation of interstate transmission and how that can save consumers money. The Nation's transmission system serves, if you will, like an interstate highway for electric power. We all know what can happen when the highway on-ramps or off-ramps are closed or when bottlenecks or breakdowns occur. The same is true of the electric transmission system. The smooth flow of electric power depends on having sufficient transmission capacity and on the system operating reliably and without disruptions. Problems in the electricity transmission system, like problems on interstate highways, can impede commerce. If some businesses are denied access, or if different highways operate under different rules, competition will suffer. 
Madam President, I believe an efficient and reliable electric transmission system will be one of the most important factors in the development of robust regional and national markets for electric power. Over the last 100 years we have developed a complex grid of transmission lines owned by private, government, and cooperative utilities. With the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress took the first steps toward providing fair and open access to portions of the transmission system. Today, Federal and State regulators are continuing to push for increased competition. These dramatic changes in regulation are placing new demands on the transmission system. We are asking it to function increasingly like the interstate highways. However, the system we have was never planned to function in this more competitive environment. 
Today we have a transmission system with many constraints and bottlenecks, with no uniform system of regulation, with some portions of the system closed to users, and without any assurance that all users of the system will follow the same rules. Clearly, we can't hope to realize the full benefits of competition if buyers and sellers of power can't deal equally in an open and fair market. Without fair competition, the cost of power is higher than it should be. My bill will help correct this situation. 
Currently, the regulation of power sales over the Nation's electric power grid is split between various State and Federal jurisdictions. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authority over pricing of transmission service. The States have authority to license and site new transmission facilities. A growing portion of power transmission and 
sales is taking place on a regional and even a national scale. We are increasingly dependent on long-distance power transmission; sometimes from as far away as 1,000 miles. In the West, every single State from New Mexico to Montana and from California to Washington is electrically interconnected. All of the Eastern States except parts of Texas are similarly interconnected. My bill seeks to maintain a careful balance of State and national interests that assures the Nation's transmission system operates efficiently, all players are treated equitably, and reliability is maintained. 
Madam President, I'd like now to describe briefly some of the key provisions in the bill.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, today as the House-Senate conferees are scheduled to meet again, I am introducing the Voluntary National Testing Act of 1997 for two main reasons: to clarify many of the misconceptions that have arisen since the Senate voted in favor of this approach, and-- to counter the mistaken impression that support for voluntary national testing has eroded in recent weeks. 
This legislation simply makes permanent the compromise approach that was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate last month. 
While the Senate amendment gave NAGB, the governing board, authority for only fiscal year 1998, this legislation would provide permanent authority. 
Otherwise, the language is identical to that amendment: it prevents anyone from being forced to take the test or attach any funding conditions on the test; transfers control immediately to the independent board, which will have full power to change any elements it deems necessary; and charges the board with revisiting key issues that have arisen so far, such as whether students should use calculators or whether there should be a test in a student's native language if needed. 
Contrary to what some may think, there are many signs that support for voluntary national tests remains strong despite scare tactics and `education-ese' being used by its opponents. 
Public opinion--as well as the views of almost every mainstream education and business organization in the country--remains strongly in favor of making rigorous, standard measures of student achievement available. 
The most recent polls show that two-thirds of the public favor the President's proposal--even more are in favor of the general approach that is in this bill. 
Though two districts have decided not to administer the reading exam, all 15 original districts are still planning to administer at least the math test and all 7 States that have signed up remain on board for both exams. 
Contrary to what is being said, I do not think there has been any major controversy about the NAEP tests we are planning to use as models for the new ones--after all, pretty much everyone can agree on what we expect our children to know about reading and math at fourth and eighth grade. 
There is not much that's controversial about reading a paragraph from Charlotte's Web, or figuring out a word problem in math. 
The benefits of a voluntary national test are clear to the parents and teachers who are most determined to see better schools for their children. 
Let us allow State and local communities to decide for themselves, rather than making the decision for them here in Washington. 
Right now, many States currently offer tests and some are quite good--but they have no common standard and many mislead parents into thinking their children are doing better than they actually are. 
Under the new approach, many students would struggle and even fail at first, it's true. But, through the combined efforts of their teachers, parents, and community leaders, far more than anyone expected beforehand would eventually succeed--it's happening in Milwaukee and Philadelphia already. 
The voluntary national tests are about setting high expectations for all children, measuring progress in a way that's widely accepted, and demanding accountability for improvements that we all know are needed. They are not about treating minorities unfairly or usurping local and parental control over what is taught in school, which I would never support. 
With a common measure of progress it becomes increasingly possible to win additional financial support so desperately needed--it is a necessary step. Voluntary national tests would provide parents new insight so they could push hard for improvements in our public schools that might otherwise not occur. 
Support in the Senate remains solidly in favor of the compromise approach to developing a voluntary national test. 
Faced with a choice between banning the tests and transferring control to an independent board, 87 Senators less than a month ago voted in favor of developing the tests under the governing board. 
I recently worked with 43 Senators to sign a very strong letter pledging to filibuster the conference report if it banned development of the tests before States or districts could decide. This support overwhelms the opposition of a small part of the Senate, led by Senator Ashcroft. 
If necessary, this is more than enough to block consideration of the conference report or support a Presidential veto--regardless of how the House votes.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep sorrow about the death of Susan Landon on September 28, 1997. Ms. Landon, a citizen of New Mexico and resident of the city of Albuquerque, graduated from the University of New Mexico. She went on to fulfill a rich and varied career writing for the Albuquerque Journal. I have become familiar with Susan's work, as she reported on a range of issues spanning much of the breadth of contemporary New Mexico life. 
Ms. Landon worked as the youth page editor, and as a reporter for general assignments, education, and State news. She began writing for the Journal's editorial page in 1992, and continued to do so until a few weeks before her death. Susan excelled in her assignments, winning numerous city, State, and national journalism awards. She found particular satisfaction through her work covering various Native American issues, and was thanked publicly by the president of the Navajo Nation for the sensitivity and understanding which was reflected in her writings. 
I would like to quote from an article written by Jim Belshaw, a friend and colleague of Susan, in which he said `Susan Landon was smart and fair and irreverent and compassionate and tough; she was a native New Mexican who knew and loved the State and its people. She had an unerring ability to cut through rhetoric and get to the heart of a matter, regardless of its camouflage.'

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me speak for a few minutes, then, on campaign finance reform. I would like to step back from the details of the debate. There has been some debate about limiting spending: Should we limit spending or not, should we ban soft money or not, should we regulate phony issue advocacy ads or not, should we provide more power to the Federal Election Commission or not--those are the kinds of questions we debate here. But I believe this entire discussion about campaign finance reform is about one central question and that is what should determine the outcome of our Federal elections? Should we allow money to determine the outcome of our Federal elections? Or should we allow, or try to get to a situation, where a complete and a balanced discussion of the differences between the candidates determines the outcome of the election? Should we allow money or helpful information to change the minds of voters? And should we allow money or robust debate to determine who wins the race? 
This fundamental issue, which I think is at the center of campaign finance reform, has been obscured because opponents of campaign finance reform have been hiding behind what I believe are mistaken Supreme Court opinions that have tried to equate money and speech. They argue that money is speech, and, therefore, to limit money is to limit speech. They say that money is robust debate. They say money is helpful information for voters. And they even say that money is or constitutes a complete and a balanced discussion about the differences between candidates. 
In my view this argument is blatantly wrong. To any reasoned observer of our Federal campaigns, the argument obviously is without merit. Ask any challenger to an incumbent Senator if the millions of dollars that an incumbent is able to raise and spend in the race has meant more robust debate, more helpful information for the voters, more complete and valuable discussions about the difference between the candidate and the challenger? 
The challenger will laugh out loud at the question. 
My colleague said, to limit spending in campaigns is to assist incumbents because you have a lot of challengers out there who would like to be able to spend more than incumbents to challenge them and to get their message out and they are not able to do so. Madam President, that may be true for a very few rich individuals who have very substantial private wealth that they can put into races. But for an average candidate for public office in this country, your ability to raise large sums of money and compete in the media and buy the air time is directly dependent upon your incumbency. Accordingly, a challenger is at a very substantial disadvantage unless we somehow restrict or control the amount of money coming into this process. 
Ask any voter who has been deluged with negative TV ads, funded by swelling campaign war chests, whether those TV ads have produced a more robust debate and provided more helpful information to the voters, or a more complete and balanced discussion of the differences between the candidates? They would think that you were crazy to suggest that those 30-second negative TV spots in fact improve their ability to make a reasoned judgment. 
No, the vast increases in money spent in political campaigns have not produced more robust debate, they have not produced more helpful information for voters, or more complete and balanced discussions about the differences between candidates. This increased amount of money has meant the very opposite. In fact, voters will tell you not only that money does not equal speech, but that excessive campaign money does equal the erosion and the undermining of our political system. 
To them, money means bad government. To them, money is not speech; money is the corruption of the system. The American people are very specific in their beliefs about this, Madam President. Voters surveyed recently by the Princeton Survey Associates tell us exactly what the public thinks: 
55 percent of the public think that campaign money gives one group more influence by keeping other groups from having their say in policy outcomes; 
50 percent think that campaign money gets some people appointed to government office who would not otherwise be considered; 
48 percent think that campaign money keeps important legislation from being passed in the Senate and in the House of Representatives; 
45 percent think that campaign money leads elected officials to support policies that even those elected officials don't think are best for the country; 
41 percent think that campaign money even leads elected officials to vote against the interests of the constituents who sent them to Washington; 
63 percent of the public think that campaign money leads elected officials to spend too much time fundraising; 
And, finally, 52 percent think that money, and not speech, determines the outcome of elections under our current system. 
Madam President, it is hard to argue with the public's view on these various points. I submit that the arguments by opponents of campaign finance reform, that money is speech, should not and fortunately does not pass the laugh test with the American people. 
The people are right, that we desperately need to reform the campaign system. In fact, they are right that we need to do a full U-turn from where we are today. We need to reduce the amount of money raised and spent in campaigns. We need to increase the amount of robust debate, providing really helpful information to voters. We need to increase the amount of complete and balanced discussions about the differences between candidates so the public has good information. 
Even the modified McCain-Feingold campaign reform bill is a big step in the right direction. It does at least two very important things. First, it will reduce the amount of big unregulated donations from corporations and unions and wealthy individuals in our campaigns, and that is good. We need to reduce that. And second, it will regulate the huge amounts of money spent by so-called independent special interest groups on advertising that they disguise as issue ads but are, in fact, designed to advocate the defeat of a particular camp. 
The original McCain-Feingold bill did much more. There were more affirmative proposals to actually encourage more robust debate, more helpful information for the voters, more complete and balanced discussions of the differences between the candidates, but the bill had to be scaled back to reduce the objections of some of the opponents of campaign finance reform. This modified version of the bill that we now have before us does not complete the U-turn that we ought to be making, but it is turning the car in the right direction. 
Madam President, I stand ready to support the modified version of McCain-Feingold. I hope we will have an opportunity at some point in the near future, and hopefully this week, to have an up-or-down vote on the bill. Perhaps at some point we can get past these parliamentary maneuvers of killer amendments, of filling out the amendment tree, second-degree amendments to block an up-or-down vote. Perhaps at some point in the near future the opponents of campaign finance reform will listen to the people and conclude that money is not speech, that money, in fact, is undermining the political system that we were sent here to help ensure the functioning of. 
I hope we will move expeditiously this week to pass campaign finance reform. Our constituents desire it, and we should do it. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this bill that I have just sent to the desk, in my view, gives us a chance in this Congress to grasp a historic opportunity to make a real difference for the American people for generations to come. 
Most Americans can name various geologic treasures and places of wonder within our land. Places like Diamond Head in Hawaii, the Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho, the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado readily come to mind because our people have access to them. However, there is a place in New Mexico that rivals these areas in splendor and yet, few people know about, or fully appreciate its significance. It is called the Valles Caldera. 
The Valles Caldera is one of the world's greatest volcanic features. A large circular crater 12-15 miles in diameter, the views from the rim are awe inspiring. As one looks across the vast green valleys and mountains that now sit within the ring of the caldera, and realizes that they are all merely the cooled workings of a resurgent lava dome, one is struck by the sheer magnitude of the natural forces that created the Jemez Mountains in north central New Mexico. 
The explosions that created the caldera, some 1.2 million years ago, ejected over 100 cubic miles of earth, rock, and lava. It is estimated that if the original mountain had come to a peak that it would have been taller than Mount Everest. 
However very few people, even in New Mexico, have ever been on this land. Since 1860, it has been in private ownership. At 
that time it was granted by the United States to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca as part of a settlement of Spanish land grant claims under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and has since been known as the Baca Land & Cattle Company. 
It has passed through several owners since 1860, and about once in a generation the United States has tried to purchase the land. The first time was in the 1930's. Again, in the 1960's the late former Senator from New Mexico, Clinton P. Anderson tried to negotiate a deal for the land. Finally in 1980, the owner of the land, James `Pat' Dunigan, was in negotiations with the Government to sell the land when he died a premature death. Now, his family has come forward and said they would like to fulfill his dream of seeing this land move into public ownership. 
Mr. President, this is an opportunity that we cannot let pass us by. In 1993, the Forest Service completed a study of this land which lays out the tremendous value it could have within public ownership: 
First, the Valles Caldera is the classic example of a resurgent lava dome. The study of its features has helped geologists to understand volcanic processes throughout the world; 
Second, the recreation potential is enormous. Hiking, camping, cross-country skiing, photography, horse back riding, hunting, and fishing are obvious possibilities. 
The headwaters of the Jemez and San Antonio rivers are located on this land, and represent some of the best trout fishing streams in New Mexico. There are nearly 27 miles of trout streams on the ranch, most of which meander through grass meadows perfect for fly fishing. 
Also over 6,000 elk live on this land, making it ideal for hunting. 
Perhaps the most unique features of this land are the seven enormous open grassland valleys that are tailor made for horseback riding. 
Third, finally, and perhaps most important, this land has been well preserved. Through careful management of their grazing land, selective timbering, and the use of proscribed fire, the current owners have maintained the caldera as an ecological jewel. With over 65,000 acres of conifer forests mixed with aspen, gamble oak, and broken rock known as felsenmeer, and 30,000 acres of lush grasslands, the Caldera supports an abundance of wildlife, including black bears and cougars. 
Mr. President, words are a poor substitute for seeing this land, and although pictures cannot convey its grandeur, they may provide my colleagues with a sense of it: 
First, to give people a sense of location, here is a map of north central New Mexico. To the south is Albuquerque and then Santa Fe above it. You'll notice that the Baca Ranch is nestled between the Santa Fe National Forest, and Bandelier National Monument, which many members of the public have visited. 
Second, here is a satellite photo of the volcano. The black outline represents the Baca Ranch, approximately 95,000 acres. For perspective, on the right side of this photo is Los Alamos, NM, and just below it is the Bandelier National Monument. This large yellow spot on the bottom right corner of the caldera rim is known as the Valle Grande. It is the only part of the Ranch that most people have seen because state highway 4 comes through on the side, but it is only one of seven valleys on the property. 
Third, here's a picture of the Valle Grande, it's about 4 miles wide and 6 miles long covering over 17,000 acres. 
Fourth, and here is the upper Jemez river which originates and meanders through the Valle Grande. 
Fifth, finally, here is a picture of the Valle Toledo the third largest valley on the property, about 4,000 acres. 
Mr. President, the legislation I'm introducing today does two things: it gives the Forest Service the authority to start negotiating for the purchase of this land in good faith by authorizing appropriations, land exchanges, and the acceptance of donations; and it rationalizes the boundaries between the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National Monument for consistent management of their respective watersheds. 
Acquiring land of this quality and magnitude will not be cheap or easy. It will take a lot of work on the part of this body and our counterparts on the House, and on the part of the administration. However, if we don't close this deal this time, I'm not sure the American people will ever forgive us. Although the Dunigan's have been great stewards of the land, they want to sell it. Who knows how future owners may use this land. 
When Senator Anderson tried to acquire this land for the United States 35 years ago, we could have bought this land for less than $5 million. Now the costs will be much much greater, and if it is ever subdivided, the costs will go up exponentially. 
Mr. President, I know that many people will want to argue about the management of this land. There are many, many uses that this land could be put to, but I would caution my colleagues that now is not the time to argue over future use. Let's worry about how we will acquire the land first. Management options can be worked out later. 
I think it will take additional time before a full management plan can be put in place for the property. It would be an exercise in futility for us to try to work all of that out before we move to take advantage of this historic opportunity. 
Mr. President, I understand that there is support for this effort to bring this property into public ownership by others in the delegation. I very much want to work with them and with people in the administration to see this happen. It is a very important initiative and a very important goal for us to pursue in the second session of this Congress. So I hope very much that we can make progress on it.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment that we are offering would avoid further sales of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It accomplishes this goal by providing alternative sources of funding for the Interior bill to replace the planned sale of $207.5 million that is now in the bill as reported by the Appropriations Committee. 
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established under the Energy Policy Conservation Act of 1975. It is our Nation's primary insurance policy against market chaos if there is an international oil supply disruption. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Strategic Petroleum Reserve were authorized earlier this year in the Senate by unanimous consent. 
For the past several years, the Interior Appropriations Act has included sales of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as an offset to Federal spending in that bill. I recognize that such sales have been proposed in the past by the administration, that they have been undertaken reluctantly by the Appropriations Committee. But depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even to fund the worthy programs in this bill now before the Senate is an unwise policy. 
In hearings before the Senate Energy Committee earlier this year, we had several distinguished experts on world oil markets and on the Middle East repeatedly emphasizing the fragility of the current political situation in the major oil-producing regions outside of the United States. We have no assurance that the near future might not bring unwelcome political changes that would result in a reduction in the world's energy security. While the United States itself does not import an overwhelming fraction from the Middle East, the world oil market is highly integrated, and shortages anywhere quickly translate into higher prices at the pump here in the United States. 
In this context, annual sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve amount to a piecemeal cancellation of our national energy insurance policy. Moreover, our sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have been cited by other countries as justification for selling off their oil reserves to offset short-term spending needs that they themselves have. We saw this happen in Germany earlier this year when they sold oil from their strategic reserves to raise the extra revenue needed to bring their budgets within the guidelines contained in the Maastricht Treaty. 
Sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have negative short-term impacts for ordinary Americans, in addition to these longer term threats to our Nation as a whole. Whenever the Federal Government dumps $200 million of oil on the market, it delivers a sucker punch to the independent oil and gas producers who are operating on the margin of profitability. Our independent producing sector is an important part of the oil supply equation in the United States. The oil and gas industry is the second largest industry in my State of New Mexico. If there is a way to avoid inflicting these economic losses on these mom-and-pop operations that characterize a good deal of our domestic industry, we need to do that. In this context, I will note that my efforts and those of my cosponsor have been strongly endorsed by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, by the National Stripper Well Association and by the American Petroleum Institute. 
Fortunately, we found a way to avoid sales of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in this bill without cutting $200 million of funding for programs that affect Indian tribes, energy 
conservation, national parks, research and development, the arts, and the other vital subjects covered by the bill. Pursuant to the Defense Authorization Act of 1996, the Secretary of Energy is required to sell the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve. It now appears that the Secretary will receive more for Elk Hills than is accounted for in the balanced budget agreement. 
The amendment I am offering today takes these excess proceeds, uses them as a funding source in place of oil sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We will not know the exact amount of the excess proceeds until January of 1998 when the administration sends the Congress a final proposal to sell Elk Hills under the 31-day notice-and-wait provision contained in the law that authorizes that sale. The possibility exists, though, that we could capture enough funds through this amendment to obviate the need to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve next year and potentially beyond. This coupling will certainly be a consideration in my judgment as to whether it is a good idea for Congress to allow the sale of Elk Hills to go forward. 
This amendment is intended as a positive step to meet the needs being addressed by the Interior bill by tapping an alternative source of funds instead of sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Stopping SPR sales as a source of general revenue is a good national economic policy. It is good for our domestic oil and gas industry, and particularly for the most vulnerable independent producers of oil and gas in my State and other petroleum-producing States. 
I urge adoption of the amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to make a few points. The first point is, I did speak to Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, in the last hour. He has authorized me to indicate to all Senators that he strongly supports the amendment that Senator Murkowski and I are offering, and he believes it is a good public policy and a policy that we ought to adopt here. 
I also want to indicate a particular appreciation to Bob Simon on my staff, who is the person who has done all the work in coming up with this proposal.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes also in support of the National Endowment for the Arts and a strong Federal role in supporting the arts. I am honored to follow the eloquent Senator from Iowa. I think he has made a very strong case for continued Federal support in this area. I also believe the Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, made a very eloquent statement in support of the NEA and demonstrated great common sense in much of what he said there. 
Over the past few days, several of my colleagues have attacked the NEA, and one of the attacks has been that NEA funds are concentrated too much in big cities--six big cities in particular. I want to make it clear at the beginning of my comments that none of those big cities are in New Mexico, but still the NEA does support a very wide spectrum of arts in my State of New Mexico. 
NEA funds come to my State and support everything from opera to cowboy poets. In my hometown of Silver City where I grew up, we have an annual event where cowboy poets come from all over the country to participate. It is my understanding--and I can be corrected on this--but it is my understanding that the first cowboy poetry convention or conference that occurred in this country was in Elko, NV, and was sponsored by the NEA. 
And they have continued with that tradition in Elko, NV, ever since. 
So clearly the funds go to a broad range of arts. There have been more than 20 national competitive grants in my State in 1996.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wanted to speak first today about this Gorton amendment that we adopted yesterday as part of the Labor and Human Services appropriation measure. 
The Senate approved that amendment by a narrow vote of 51 to 49. And the effect of the amendment is to convert billions of dollars in Federal education funds into unrestricted block grants that go to school districts, and with very few restrictions or accountability for how the funding is spent. I think the amendment is extremely far-reaching, and it was a mistake by the Senate to go along with this amendment. I hope very much that, in the final analysis in the conference, we can drop the amendment and send to the President a bill that keeps intact the various programs that many of us have worked for on both the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle for many years. 
Let me just say, putting it in its baldest terms, that this amendment would eliminate much of the U.S. Department of Education. That is a radical and a misguided effort, which does not have strong public support. This is an issue that was discussed in the last Presidential campaign. It became clear, I believe, during the course of that campaign and in the polling that was done throughout the campaign and since, that the American public does not favor elimination of the Department of Education, either in a formal way or by the gutting of the Department through an amendment such as this. 
I have fundamental problems with the notion that there is no national interest in helping parents and schools and students to compete in the world economy. What we are saying is that the local schools in every part of this country can figure out how to prepare their students to compete in the international marketplace if they have no help from outside. I disagree with that. It is not realistic to expect a local school board to have at its disposal the resources and expertise that we can develop at the national level and provide as assistance in the educational process. 
So there is an honest disagreement here about whether we as a nation can step up to this responsibility and assist States and local school districts, or whether we need to stay completely out of it. I feel very much that we need to provide assistance and expertise where we can. 
The Secretary of Education, in a quotation in the morning paper, says very clearly--this is Secretary Riley in the Washington Post: 
Secretary Riley warned that the Senate's action, which he called a `back-door attempt to kill the Department of Education' would abolish many vital programs for students, including Clinton's Goals 2000 grants for school reform. 
Madam President, when you look at the roughly $12.5 billion in annual funding for Federal education programs that would go into block grants under this amendment, you see how broad-based this amendment is. Let me just go through the list so the people know what we are talking about here. 
First of all, there is the Goals 2000 program that, of course, has been somewhat controversial, but has been a great benefit to many school districts in my State. I go to school district after school district as I travel around New Mexico and talk to those school district administrators and teachers and students about the Goals 2000 program. I find good support for it. I think they appreciate the funding they have received and the assistance that the Federal Government provides. So it would be eliminated. 
The School-to-Work Program. The education funds involved in the School-to-Work Program--not the Department of Labor funds, but the Education Department funds--would be eliminated. 
Education technology. This has been a concern of mine and of many Senators for many years now as to how do we get additional resources to our schools and to our school districts so that they can put in place the various purchasing of hardware and software and training of teachers that is necessary for them to turn out a technologically literate group of graduates at the end of the high school experience. 
Star Schools Program, the regional technology education consortia, the telecommunications demonstration programs that are in place around the country, the challenge grants for technology innovation, technology literacy challenge fund--all of these are specific initiatives that have benefited my State significantly. 
I think it would be a major error for us to eliminate the Federal funds. Some will say we are not eliminating Federal funds, we are giving a block grant to the school districts and if they want to spend them on this, they can. The unfortunate reality is that a local school district is under tremendous pressure. The school board members in my State are elected, as they are throughout most of the country. They are under tremendous pressure at the local level to raise salaries, raise salaries for school administrators, to build additional facilities, and to do a whole range of things. If we want funds to go to improve technological literacy and provide educational technology for our schools, we have to specify that is what the money goes for. Otherwise, the reality is that it will be spent for other purposes. 
So this Gorton amendment eliminates any requirement that any funds be spent for this purpose. I think that would be a major mistake. In my own State, we have received, this year, about $1.7 million in Federal funds for educational technology. We are expected, this next year, to receive $3.5 million in funds. The total, nationwide, is $425 million. I think this is money well spent. It is cost-effective. It is a cost-effective way for the taxpayers to try to assist in improving education at the local level. 
Let me go through some of the others that are covered here. The Eisenhower professional development State grants. These are funds that go to assist teachers in getting additional training so that they can better teach and remain in the profession of teaching. The innovative education program strategies under title 6. The safe and drug-free schools program. Again, in my State, I have gone to many schools and they have been extremely appreciative that the safe and drug-free schools program has allowed them to hire counselors to work at the middle school level, so that when students are beginning to get into difficulties with drugs or beginning to lose interest in school and become truant, they can have counselors there to be an early prevention device to keep those students involved. That safe and drug-free schools money would be eliminated under this amendment. 
The magnet schools assistance. That, again, has been very helpful in many school districts around the country. Education for homeless children and youth. Women's educational equity funding. Education for native Hawaiians. Alaska Native education equity funding. Charter schools funding. Funding for Indian education. All of these are specific programs that will not be funded if this amendment prevails. So, clearly, I think we have a major problem. Bilingual and immigration education programs are another example. 
The key part of this amendment that I think is most objectionable is that it creates an unmonitored windfall to local school districts that would be used for any of a wide range of purposes. There would be no oversight, no accountability as to how any of the funds are spent. The various purposes that we have meticulously specified over the years as priorities for the Nation, those priorities will be put aside. 
Let me mention one other program, Madam President, that I think is of particular concern as to how it would fare under this amendment, and that is title I. When I talk to elementary schoolteachers and administrators in my State, the one Federal program that they consistently point to and say `thank you' for sending the funds to the State and to local districts, it is in this title I area. That is funding for disadvantaged students. It makes a tremendous difference in many of our schools. I think for us to--in an amendment here on the floor, without hearings, without any comprehension of what we are doing--just say we are going to eliminate title I, I think that is highly irresponsible. I believe very strongly that we made a serious mistake when we went that way. 
So there is no accountability if this amendment prevails. There is no oversight by the Federal Government as to how these funds are spent if this amendment prevails. We would cut State support networks out of the picture, also, if this amendment prevails. The Gorton amendment fully bypasses State educational agencies. In my State, our State educational agencies help to coordinate and monitor programs. Those are all bypassed under the amendment. Some people think that block granting education funds might give local school districts more control or more funding. The reality is that if we block grant these programs and bypass the entire State education network, we put a huge administrative burden on school districts, which very few of them are equipped to handle at this point. About 6 percent of Federal funds is taken off the top by States for administrative and technical expenses. I wish they didn't have to take any expenses off. But I fear that we will see a duplication at the local district level that will soak up substantially more than 6 percent of the total Federal funds if we bypass the networks that the States have set up. 
In my own State, there is really no way to anticipate the total effect of this amendment. It is untried. Funding levels would basically be determined by having each individual district conduct a self-reported census on its own of all school-age children in the district, weigh the district's funding according to each State's average per capita income level. It is not difficult to guess that we won't do nearly as well in my State as some might think. Current formulas already awarding money directly to the school district based on individual community need would be scrapped and many communities would be left to fend for themselves. 
Madam President, in summary, let me just say that this amendment should not become law. I am persuaded that if it remains in this bill, the President will veto the bill, as he should. 
I think this is the kind of irrational, unwise, misguided action which we sometimes get involved in here in the Senate when we don't have active debate. There was not adequate debate on the Gorton amendment. We have not had hearings in the Education Subcommittee of the Labor and Human Resources Committee on the Gorton amendment. If Senator Gorton and other sponsors of this bill want to pursue this course of action, I believe it should be put out as a piece of legislation that we can have hearings on in the authorizing committee. I am fortunate to be a member of the Labor, Health and Human Resources Committee which has worked long and hard over the years to authorize the various Federal programs being eliminated with this amendment. I think the proper course would be to have a full set of hearings on all of these programs, and determine which of them should be eliminated. If the will of the Senate and the will of the Congress and the will of President is to eliminate some of them, then fine. But coming along with this kind of an amendment absent hearings and absent adequate debate I think is not the responsible way to proceed. 
So I would join others here in objecting strenuously to the provision. As Senator Dodd suggested yesterday on the floor, if the bill comes back from the appropriations conference with this provision in it, he would commit to filibuster against the 1998 appropriations bill. I hope very much that course is not required. But, obviously, I and many others would have to join him in that course of action, if that amendment remains in the legislation. 
Mr. President, how much time remains?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a few minutes here on the subject of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. My distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, spoke about it this week. He, of course, is the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee which is one of the key committees with responsibility over this subject matter. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as I understand it, is intended to be sent by the administration to the Senate in the very near future. And I want to just reemphasize some of the points that Senator Biden made, and highlight the importance of the treaty to our national security and international peace. 
In the wake of the cold war, our world remains a very dangerous place in which to live. When the United States and the Soviet Union were still aiming thousands of nuclear warheads at each other during the cold war, all of us understood the danger that existed--perhaps only a half an hour away. But with the fall of international communism, the world breathed a huge sigh of relief, and hoped that we could move into a postnuclear age. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major part of the hope and a major part of what needs to be done in order to move into that postnuclear age. 
No greater threat to our national security or international peace exists than the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The potential damage that such weapons could do remains no less a threat than the one that we feared during the cold war. Think for a moment about the possibility of terrorists armed with nuclear weapons having been in the Tokyo subway instead of terrorists there with nerve gas. Think of the possibility of terrorists having been in Oklahoma City with a small nuclear weapon instead of with the weapon that was there. Perhaps my colleagues have read recent reports about the suitcase-sized nuclear weapons being unaccounted for in Russia. Whether these reports are true or not I recently had the chance to visit Russia and observe a model of the nuclear weapons that existed there; the size of artillery shells. And I am told that is also a weapon that we have had in our own inventory at various times. Such miniature nuclear weapons are indeed, feasible. They pose a realistic threat to the post-cold war world in which we live. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a critical element in the spectrum of policies and actions that we need to take to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons of whatever size--prevent the spread of them to rogue nations, to terrorist organizations, to individuals bent on some type of irrational destructive behavior. For countries that have no nuclear weapons, it is impossible for them to develop nuclear weapons and be confident that they will work without being able to test them. 
Senator Biden recently stated that the proof of this belief is manifested by the current reluctance of Pakistan and India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. These nations currently prefer to be able to test their weapons in order to ensure that they work--thereby demonstrating their nuclear capability and supporting their foreign policy goals. The danger of a nuclear conflict between these two nations and the potential impact such a war could have on the entire planet should be very clear to everyone who serves here in the Senate. 
But India and Pakistan, and other potential nuclear powers, will not step back from the nuclear brink if the United States and the other nuclear powers do not take convincing steps toward controlling, reducing, and eliminating nuclear weapons through arms control treaties, specifically through the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
The recent seismic event that occurred off the coast of northern Russia reminds us of how important it is for the Senate to ratify and for the world to implement this test ban treaty. In this case the experts disagree among themselves about the exact nature of the event. Article IV of the treaty will ensure that we could take steps to clarify whether or not that incident was a nuclear explosion or an underground earthquake. But, without the treaty, the experts will continue to massage the data in search for definitive answers. With the treaty, we could observe some answers directly through on-site inspection. 
Without the treaty, potential nuclear powers might well conclude that today's superpowers are ignoring their promises to discontinue nuclear testing--that, therefore, license exists for these nonnuclear powers who have the ambition to become nuclear powers to proceed on their own path toward development of nuclear weapons with impunity. If we put this treaty in place, those same potential nuclear powers would recognize that current nuclear powers should be held accountable for their promises not to test nuclear weapons. With the treaty in place, they would know that the commitment of today's nuclear powers to nonproliferation was a genuine commitment and one that we would abide by. 
It serves the peaceful interests of the United States and the peaceful interests of countries throughout the world to take this important step to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and eliminate nuclear testing. At the same time it serves the security interests of this Nation to ensure that our nuclear weapons remain a viable deterrent force. The science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program that we have in place today as part of our defense strategy is the means by which the United States can achieve this dual goal--the goal of a comprehensive test ban to ensure nonproliferation, and also a reliable nuclear deterrent force, should we ever need such weapons in the future. I will be working hard, and I urge all my colleagues in the Senate both to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to ensure that the Stockpile Stewardship Program is fully funded and implemented. The Nation's prospects for a peaceful world and our national security demand that we move ahead on world fronts. 
I urge my colleagues to examine these and other important issues surrounding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty very carefully during the coming months. I hope that we can have this treaty presented to the Senate in the next few weeks. I hope that we can begin the hearing process this fall. I hope that early next year we can act favorably upon it. 
I have written a letter to the chairman and the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee requesting that we hold hearings on this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at our earliest opportunity--hopefully, before we adjourn this fall. I look forward to that debate. 
I am confident that the Senate will choose to ratify the treaty since it is so much in our national interest to do so and in the interests of world peace, once we have all the facts. 
Mr. President, I think it is essential that we spend some of our valuable time between now and final adjournment this fall focused on this treaty so that we can understand those facts and act responsibly on this matter. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Helen Keller, the moving spirit for the American Foundation for the Blind and many in the visually handicapped community, once said, `. . . when I hold a beloved [braille] book in my hand my limitations fall from me, my spirit is free.' 
During the recent reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act it was my pleasure to work with the American Foundation for the Blind, the National Federation of the Blind, the American Council of the Blind, and other groups to include a provision for the teaching of braille for all blind or visually impaired students for whom it is appropriate as part of the IEP process. Because of this change which is now in law, every blind or visually impaired child will soon have the chance to experience the same freedom enjoyed by Helen Keller. 
Most children who are blind or visually impaired benefit from specialized instruction in braille to enable them to participate equally with their sighted peers in school and ultimately to compete in the workplace. Additionally, for those who cannot use print, braille provides an excellent means for reading confidential information, making notes at meetings and giving presentations, recordkeeping, labeling information files, performing household management functions, and ease of studying and reviewing critical information. 
Over 57,000 students, as of 1996, were registered with the American Printing House for the Blind and over 500 students from New Mexico are registered. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that in my State, 2,500 braille books were circulated by the New Mexico State Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, the Regional Library for the Blind in Santa Fe, in fiscal year 1996. 
The mission of the American Foundation for the Blind is to enable persons who are blind or visually impaired to achieve equality of access and opportunity that will ensure freedom of choice in their lives. I am delighted that the braille provisions of the recently reauthorized Individuals With Disabilities Education Act will help all children who are blind or visually impaired to achieve this goal.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate today contains several education and health provisions that I feel are especially important and have worked hard on to help improve the lives of people in New Mexico and nationwide. 
The key health and education provisions include a plan to move control over the proposed new math and reading tests to an independent board, increased funding for education technology and technology training for teachers, first-time funding to help low-income students participate in the rigorous and cost saving academic program known as Advanced Placement, and funding for a Boarder Health Commission that I helped enact in 1994. 
It is especially important to note that the United States Senate today approved $1 million in funding to implement the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission. The Commission, which has long been one of my priorities, is designed to help improve public health along the United States-Mexico border. I requested that the funds be included in the 1998 spending bill in a letter to Senate appropriators earlier in the year. 
I led the fight to fund the Commission because I believe that we can't wait any longer to begin addressing the serious health problems along the border. They greatly affect people in nearby communities and in New Mexico. What's alarming is that many of these health problems--such as malaria and tuberculosis--can affect people nationwide. This appropriation represents the first time Federal funds have been earmarked specifically for implementation of the commission. 
The funds would go to the commission to begin a comprehensive border health needs assessment followed by a coordinated medical response to border health problems. Each United States-border State would receive two federally appointed commissioners who would work with Mexico to design and coordinate programs to improve health, water resources, sewage treatment, vector control and air quality along the border. Because of the Senate's move today, we are inching closer to being able to directing medical help to our ailing border region. 
The Senate has also now approved funding for several key education initiatives that have been some of my top priorities in this Congress. 
Perhaps most notable is that the Senate approved $30 million to train teachers in the use of technology in the classroom. The funding will be used to implement the Technology for Teachers Act, new legislation that I authored earlier this year. 
There is a tremendous effort underway to put computers in classrooms and hook schools across American into the Internet. But until now, the primary focus has been on obtaining equipment--not on training teachers to use it. We can't simply install a computer in the classroom and expect it to revolutionize education all by itself. These new resources represent the first time Federal funds have been set aside specifically for training new and current teachers in the use of education technology. 
As a founding member of the Senate Education Technology Workforce, I am also proud that the Senate voted to double the funding for the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, created by my 1994 Technology for Education Act. The fund would jump to $425 million in 1998 from $200 million in 1997. New Mexico's State Department of Education this year received $1.7 million from the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund, and awarded grants to 26 communities across the State. The 1998 funding would boost New Mexico's share to $3.55 million. 
And finally, the Senate also approved $3 million in funding to increase the number of low-income students who participate in the rigorous Advanced Placement [AP] program in schools in New Mexico and across the country. I secured this funding in the 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill in order to broaden the reach of AP classes to all students--not just to those who attend more affluent schools or have definite plans to attend college. By promoting AP, we're promoting high-standards education in our schools without creating new Federal programs. 
These are just a few of the most important elements of a bill that on the whole is very strong, I believe. However, I must note one part of the legislation that we are sending into conference with the House of Representatives, which is the Gorton amendment. 
As part of this spending bill, the Senate narrowly approved--49 to 51--an amendment by Senator Gorton that would convert billions of dollars in critical Federal education dollars into unrestricted block grants that school districts could spend with few restrictions and little accountability. For reasons I would like to describe here, I strongly oppose the amendment and will push for its elimination from the final version of the 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations measure. 
In essence, this amendment would eliminate much of the U.S. Department of Education--a radical and misguided effort that I had thought was abandoned in the face of tremendous public opposition over the last few years. 
Specifically, this amendment block grants to local districts--not states--roughly $5.5 billion in annual funding for Federal education programs. The eliminated programs would include: 
Funding for the new voluntary national tests for reading and math, which would help so many parents keep their schools accountable for preparing their students for a high-tech world; 
Title 1, the roughly $7 billion program to help poor children improve their reading and math skills in the early grades; 
The $425 million Technology for Education Act, which is already providing $1.7 million in education technology funding to 26 grantees around the state, and would rise to $3.5 million next year; 
The $50 million Charter Schools program, which helps foster the creation of more new, independent public schools like the five that are up and running in New Mexico; 
Goals 2000, which has provided millions of dollars to New Mexico as part of its effort to raise academic standards and achievement; 
The School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which has given both local and statewide implementation grants to help improve training for students going straight into the workforce from high school; 
Safe and Drug Free Schools, a program that sends Federal funds to the States and schools most affected by school violence in order to make them more orderly; 
Teacher training funds called the Eisenhower program that are used in New Mexico to help upgrade the preparation of teachers in our classrooms; and 
Bilingual and immigrant education programs, which also provide much-needed support for communities with large numbers of limited English proficient students. 
In effect, this would create an unmonitored windfall for school districts that could be used for nearly any purpose--conceivably even raising administrative salaries, or building swimming pools and tennis courts. There would be no oversight or accountability--in fact, all of the limits on administrative costs and accountability measures that rely on State oversight and are already in Federal law would be eliminated by the amendment. 
The Gorton amendment would also fully by-pass State education agencies that in New Mexico help coordinate and monitor programs. Some people think block-granting education funds might give local school districts more control or more funding. The reality is that if we block grant these programs and bypass the our entire State education network, we actually put a huge administrative burden on school districts that very few will be able to handle. And in fact, only about 6 percent of Federal funding is taken off the top by States for administrative and technical assistance. It simply isn't cost-efficient for small districts to provide the specialized training or diverse course offerings that can be provided economically at a state and regional level. 
It's also entirely unclear how New Mexico would fare under such an arrangement--there is no real way of telling from the amendment, which proposes an entirely untried approach that has never really been debated before. Funding levels would basically be determined by having each individual district conduct a self-reported census on its own of all the school-aged children in the district, and then weighting each district's funding according to each State's average per capita income level. However it's not too hard to guess that we won't do nearly as well as some may think, since current formulas already awarding money directly to districts based on individual community need would be scrapped--and many communities would be left to fend for themselves. 
For these reasons, it is my hope that this ill-conceived amendment will be dropped in conference, and left out of the final bill that is made into law. If necessary, I would likely join my colleague Senator Dodd in filibustering the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill if the Gorton amendment is kept in the final version.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me start by complimenting the Senator from Indiana for the compromise that we have worked out here. I am pleased to cosponsor that compromise amendment with him. I do think the essential point to be made here is that through this amendment, this compromise amendment, we transfer control of the development of voluntary national tests over to this independent governing board that is referring to as NAGB, the National Assessment Governing Board. This is essentially the same approach that was suggested by Secretary Riley and proposed by myself, Senator Dorgan, Senator Harkin, and offered in the amendment 1115 which we offered last week. More important, the amendment will allow the test development process to continue without any undue delay. 
Let me say a word about what NAGB is, because it would now be the organization or the entity with this responsibility. The governing board that now will oversee the development of these tests is the National Assessment Governing Board. It was established in 1988 by the Congress. It is bipartisan. It is independent. As Senator Coats indicated, it contains Governors, legislators, superintendents--now it will contain some mayors, business people, experts in education as well; and the core responsibility of this group has been to oversee the development and execution of NAEP, the National Assessment for Educational Progress. This test that we are talking about here, which will be available on an individual student basis, is to be an outgrowth of that National Assessment of Educational Progress test, which is well respected and has been for a long time. 
Let me point to two charts here, and then I know Senator Kennedy wishes to speak, Senator Wellstone and Senator Dorgan. I want to defer to them. 
Mr. President, how much time remains, and is the time controlled or is it uncontrolled at this point?

Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes, and then I will divide the remaining 6 minutes among the three Senators I indicated before. 
Let me first point to this chart which I think makes the case for these tests that the President is talking about and that many of us have supported. At the present time, we have a hodgepodge of tests that have been developed around the country that are given to students and then the results of which are given to parents, and they are told that this is an accurate description of how their child is doing in school. 
The reality is that some parents and some students are led to believe that they are performing at acceptable levels and are led to believe that the education they are receiving is an appropriate education. They don't find out the reality until they apply to college or get in the workplace and find they do not have the skills or the training they need. 
This chart shows a comparison between the standards that have been adopted by many States and the standards set by this National Assessment for Education Progress, or NAEP. You can see the dramatic difference. For example, in the case of Wisconsin, 35 percent, according to the National Assessment for Education Progress, which is the standard we are trying to give people information on, 35 percent of their students were performing at acceptable levels. According to the standard used by the State of Wisconsin, 88 percent of the students were performing at acceptable levels. 
In the case of Louisiana, the disparity is even greater. The State of Louisiana indicated that 88 percent of their students are doing fine. When you look at what the National Assessment for Education Progress given to students in Louisiana indicates, only 15 percent of their students were doing fine. So there is a dramatic disparity there. 
What we are trying to do is get good objective information to parents throughout the country. 
This is strictly voluntary. No State needs to use this test. No school district needs to use this test. No individual student needs to take this test. And if parents want to ignore the results of the comparison, they can, but it needs to be available to those who want to use it. 
This other chart I want to show is a listing of the States that have already chosen to use this voluntary test once it is developed. There are several States listed here: Alaska, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and West Virginia. There are many other States, including my own, which are thinking seriously about it. They have not taken any formal action to commit themselves to use this test, but they are looking at it and they are very interested. 
There are 15 school districts in our major urban areas that have indicated they wish to have the advantage of the benefit of taking this test or using it in their schools. 
All this amendment will do is to allow the development of the test, allow us to go forward with the development of the test so that it will be available to these States and to these school districts to the extent that they choose to use it. 
I believe this is a very good course to follow. I think this is the right thing to do for our students, it is the right thing to do for the parents of these students so that they can show with some accuracy whether their children are getting the kind of education that they are going to need in later life. 
I very much support the effort the Senator from Indiana has made here. I hope we can adopt this amendment with a large margin. 
Mr. President, I defer to the Senator from Massachusetts for a couple of minutes for him to make his statement.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to speak in support of a new Office of Tribal Colleges and Universities that has been created by Executive order, and to clarify language in the Senate Committee Report 105-58 that accompanies the legislation currently under consideration. This Executive order began as Senate Resolution 264, a Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution urging the President to issue an Executive order to promote and expand Federal assistance for Indian institutions of higher education. I am proud to be one of the initiators of this resolution, and I was very pleased when the President responded by issuing Executive Order 13021 pertaining to tribal colleges and universities in October 1996, in which he created an Office of White House Initiative in the Department of Education. The order also directed the Department of Education to `provide appropriate administrative services and staff support for the Board and the Initiative.' 
This issue was raised in two separate sections in the Senate committee report. Support for the Initiative Office was mentioned in the section pertaining to the Department of Education's Office of Indian Education, and then again in the section pertaining to the Office of Vocational Education. I ask my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, if it was the committee's intent to provide the White House Initiative Office with adequate support from the Department of Education's increased funds for general departmental management, and not from the limited funds allocated to the Office of Indian Education?

Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank my colleague for this clarification. The 30 Tribal Colleges and Universities in this country provide the best opportunity for many Native Americans to attend college. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recently published its second report on Native American colleges, pointing out the critical role they play. I believe that the office created under the White House initiative will have an opportunity to work across Federal agencies to strengthen tribal institutions of higher education and can help to implement the recommendations made in the Carnegie Foundation report. 
I know that my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, shares my concern for the support of tribal colleges and universities, and I would ask for his thoughts on this issue.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm cosponsoring this amendment to section 13(b)(12) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, to make this law reflect the on-farm realities in the West. I believe this amendment follows what must have been the true intent of legislation in the first place. Section 13 is a long list of occupations that for one reason or another we have exempted from the various overtime requirements of the law. Section 13(b)(12) in particular exempts employees of irrigation districts. 
The reason for this exemption has to do with the requirements of farming in the arid West. In my home state of New Mexico, for example, we usually have two to three months each year, from about mid-May to the end of July, where we get little or no rain. This yearly dry spell is right at the height of the dry season, and if a farmer can't irrigate his crops they die. Because of the expense of irrigation systems, most farmers belong to an irrigation district that maintains a system of canals and ditches to supply water to their fields. Most irrigation 
districts employ their ditch riders year round so that they know the system, the individual farms, and the needs of each farmer in the district, and don't have to relearn the process every year. With year-round employment these folks are an integral part of the farm community. However, the work these people do is very seasonal. Typically, a ditch rider will work long and hard hours during the summer irrigation season, and have a relatively lax work schedule the rest of the year. In enacting section 13(b)(12), Congress recognized the importance that year-round employment has for both the ditch riders and their families, and the farming community. However, it appears that in acknowledging the unique working conditions required for western farms, that the law was written too narrowly. The current section exempts: 
. . . any employee employed in agriculture or in connection with the operation or maintenance of ditches, canals, reservoirs, or waterways, not owned or operated for profit, or operated on a share-crop basis, and which are used exclusively for supply and storing of water for agricultural purposes. 
The phrase `exclusively for supply and storing of water for agricultural purposes,' has recently been interpreted by rulings in the 9th and 10th Circuit Courts to mean that all of the water from a district's system must be used for irrigation or the district loses the exemption. 
This strict all or nothing approach just doesn't match with the reality of western farming communities and the day-to-day life on a western farm. In the dry and dusty summer months it is very typical for farmers to use of their irrigation water for dust control, and for watering their lawns and flower beds. That is just human nature. However, the vast majority of water is used for growing crops. 
Mr. President, this amendment, which changes the exemption to required that `at least ninety percent' of the water be used for agriculture, merely reflects a practical application of this long established exemption. As the irrigation season is just winding down for this year, the farm districts will soon be making decisions regarding whether to retain their ditch riders in light of the recent court rulings. With this in mind, I ask my colleagues to accept this amendment now, so that there won't be any disruption to these people's lives.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for the amendment being offered by Senator Harkin. 
As I have said on the floor a number of times today and in the past, we must not delay the time when every parent and teacher really knows how each child is doing academically. 
For that reason, I am proud to cosponsor the amendment, which transfers oversight over the new tests to the independent and bipartisan National Assessment Governing Board. 
This is an approach that I, having long worked with this Board through my participation on the National Education Goals Panel, believe will ensure that the new tests are fair, and independent of political influence.

Mr. BINGAMAN. It strikes me that the job of Congress is to appropriate funds for the Federal courts to administer justice as best they see fit. I am wondering why we are trying to wade in and specify how this particular Federal judge administered the implementation of the consent decree which has been entered in his court. It strikes me that we have Federal courts all over the country and we have consent decrees in place in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of cases all over the country. Here we are, singling out one of those cases and saying we are going to step in and specify how a Federal judge in the future should implement the administration of that consent decree. It just seems to me that we are micromanaging, in the worst possible way, and really stepping into an area that the Congress should stay out of. 
We should get on with the business that we were given to do under the Constitution, which is to pass appropriations bills, and we should let the courts administer the cases that are before them. I ask the Senator from Maryland if he would agree with that basic view.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this morning, the appropriations subcommittee is having a hearing, as I understand it, to resolve the question about testing. The President has proposed a reading test that would be voluntarily made available to States and local school districts for fourth graders where the school wants to provide testing in reading, and one for eighth graders in mathematics. 
There has been some controversy about this. Senator Coats from Indiana has proposed an amendment which would--the Coats amendment and the Gregg amendment together, as I understand it--essentially prohibit the use of funds to go forward with the development of these tests. I believe this would be a very grave mistake for this Congress to make if we were to prohibit the Department of Education from going forward with the development of these tests. I think the President's support on this issue has been strong. The White House has indicated that they would veto the legislation if, in fact, it did contain a prohibition on the use of funds to go ahead and develop these tests. 
As I see it, the tests that the President has proposed and the Department of Education would like to develop and make available to school districts and to States is designed to allow parents, to empower parents, to understand the educational performance and the achievement level of their own children and how well the school that their child is attending is doing in preparing their child for a career later on. 
The Coats amendment, as I said, would prohibit the development of the tests, and I think that would be a very serious mistake. 
The problem we have today, frankly, is that every State that gives tests--and all of our States do give tests--every State that gives tests measures by a different standard how well their students are doing. Accordingly, you have some States where most all the students do reasonably well on the test that is provided, and there is a general perception that they are going to be fine. The general trend is that everybody thinks that although the school system nationally, the educational system nationwide, is in serious difficulty, they believe that their own child is getting a good education. It just doesn't add up. Every individual child in our country cannot be getting a good education and still have the vast majority getting a less than quality education. 
What we need to do is to have a system where there is agreement as to what the standard is, there is agreement as to what the test results demonstrate, and then parents can make an intelligent decision about how their child is doing relative to other children, how their child is doing, how their school that their child attends is doing relative to other schools in that same district and relative to other schools in the State or in the Nation. 
We have today what is called the National Assessment for Educational Progress test, and that is a test that in 43 States tens of thousands of students participate in on a voluntary basis. This test has been in place now for 25 years. The problem, of course, is that it is not available to most students. But clearly, communities, States, and school districts recognize that it is a good, objective assessment of how the students in the schools are doing. 
What we are trying to do through the development of these new tests is to take the model that the NAEP, the National Assessment for Educational Progress, has developed and, essentially, have a test that then is available for each student in each school around the country where they want to have that test administered. 
I believe this is important because I believe that improvement in education in the country is going to have to be driven by concern of parents. They are the ones who need to understand the quality of the education that their children are receiving. Without something like this test available, you are 
not going to have the level of concern by parents that is necessary in order to ensure and require the improvements in education that I believe are needed. 
Let me just indicate that there is nothing that complicated about the tests that they are talking about giving here. The reading test is a simple one. One example is they essentially go through and ask fourth graders to describe Charlotte to a friend after they read a passage from the well-known book `Charlotte's Web.' That is a commonsense kind of a test that all of us would like our children to be able to pass. It is the kind of test which is appropriate to make available to all of our schools. 
The same thing in math. The test there is a straightforward test. There is nothing convoluted or complicated about it. It tests basic math skills for eighth graders, and, goodness knows, everybody in this country, every parent I talked to believes their child should be prepared with a basic understanding of math by the time they complete the eighth grade. 
Let me say, the business community strongly supports the President's initiative to have these tests available to States and school districts. There has been a call, a repeated call and a consistent call, by the business community to have more objective assessment going on in our schools so that we don't have so much rhetoric, but we have actual information, good solid information, about how well our students are doing. 
That is exactly what employers require before they hire a person. They give them those objective tests to determine whether they have the basic skills in reading and in mathematics so that they can become productive employees. For us not to make those same kind of objective tests available in the schools before they get out into the workplace I think would be a serious mistake. 
Not only does the business community support this, the public supports it. In the most recent national poll, 77 percent of the public that was questioned supported establishing national standards; 67 percent specifically supported using national tests, such as were described and supported by the President and the Department of Education. 
I know that we have testimony being presented this morning. Secretary Riley is making the case before the Appropriations Committee. I hope very much that he will be persuasive to the members of that committee and that we can go forward with the funding of these tests as the administration intends. 
I do think this is an issue that has great long-term consequences for our country. It would be a serious mistake for us to head this off. We already have a whole number of States--I see the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee on the floor here right now. His State of Alaska has chosen to participate voluntarily in the use of these tests when they are made available. The superintendent of public instruction in my State of New Mexico has indicated his desire that we should also participate at some future date in the use of these tests. There are many States that are anxious to participate. There are many large school districts in our larger cities that have indicated the same thing. 
We need to keep faith with them, go forward and develop these tests, make the tests available. If they want to use them, so much the better, that is their choice. But it would be a serious mistake for this Congress to try to make that decision for the States, make that decision for the local school districts by denying the Department of Education the funds necessary to go ahead and develop these tests. 
So I hope very much that, once the appropriations subcommittee concludes its hearing on the issue, we can proceed to dispose of this matter. I hope very much that the Coats amendment and the Gregg amendment, which is a second-degree amendment, as I understand it, or a perfecting amendment, that those amendments can be disposed of and we can proceed to pass this legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the amendment that the Senator from Iowa has offered on increasing the funding for the FDA youth tobacco initiative. This amendment will restore full funding for the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco initiative in order to prevent tobacco use by teenagers and adolescents. The goal of the amendment is to prevent illegal sales of tobacco products to children. 
In the bill presently before us, the Senate has allocated $4.9 million for the implementation of the FDA regulations that restrict the sale and distribution of tobacco products to young people. 
This is not adequate funding. The FDA will not be able to enforce the restrictions on the sale of tobacco to children unless the additional funds proposed by the Harkin amendment are agreed to. Some have said that the amendment is premature and the tobacco settlement is still being reviewed. Here in the Congress we will provide the money that the FDA needs in order to go ahead with the enforcement called for in the current regulations. 
First, I point out that it is not that clear that Congress will go ahead and approve a settlement similar to that proposed by the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. Even if we are able to agree upon legislation to implement such an agreement, money for FDA enforcement through that settlement is not likely to be provided before fiscal year 1999, and the FDA enforcement and outreach efforts are very important and should not be delayed until that time. 
It should also be noted that the amendment has a sunset provision. The Harkin amendment has a sunset provision, and if funding for the FDA tobacco initiative is provided for fiscal year 1998 through any tobacco settlement legislation, then the extra funds covered by that offset would be rescinded under the amendment. The amendment would raise the level to $34 million in fiscal year 1998 so that the FDA, working with the States, can carry out rules to prevent kids from smoking. 
Clearly, the need to give more attention and more effort and more resources to the effort to prevent young people from smoking is clear: 4.5 million young people, ages 12 through 17, are smokers today. High school seniors are smoking at the highest rates they have in 17 years. Nearly 90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of 18 and began with that habit. Today, just like every other day of the year, another 3,000 young people will become regular smokers. If current rates continue, more than 5 million children under age 18 who are alive today will wind up being killed by smoking-related diseases. 
A root cause of youth smoking is the easy access that kids have to tobacco. A survey by the Centers for Disease Control shows that children and adolescents were able to buy tobacco products 67 percent of the time that they tried. The CDC found that most young smokers usually buy cigarettes without questions being asked and without any identification being requested. 
The American people support the effort that the FDA is making to reduce smoking among young people. Their strong support is shown in recent polls among the public with the use-access provisions of the FDA rule in the enforcement of those provisions. Eighty-seven percent of the public agreed with the FDA policy setting a national minimum age of 18 for the purchase of tobacco products. It is estimated that there are more than $1 million in illegal sales of tobacco products to children and adolescents in the United States every year. 
Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that this amendment, which Senator Harkin has offered and I have cosponsored with him, will allow us to enforce the law that is in effect in all 50 States--the law against the sale of tobacco products to minors. It simply restores full funding to the FDA's tobacco initiative to prevent teenage tobacco use. 
I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, a little over two weeks ago, I sat down with several Albuquerque families who are working hard to pay the bills, put food on the table, and give their children a good home. Among those gathered at the meeting, there was Carol Howell, who is struggling with the help of her husband to make ends meet and raise four children. And there was Jan Usinger, a divorced mother with a Masters degree in French, working three jobs to build a decent life for her three children. 
Each of the families I met were perfect examples of who should reap the benefits of any tax relief package produced by Congress. And yet, what brought us together that day was the sad fact that none of these families would be able to claim the highly-touted $500 per child tax credit in the bill passed by the Senate --not because they earned too much money, but because they earned too little. In the eyes of some in Congress, these families were not rich enough to deserve the full child tax credit. Some even argued that to give hard-working families making about $25,000 a year a tax break was like giving them welfare. 
I'm pleased to say that in the heated debate that took place in Washington over who should be allowed to claim the child tax credit, these families finally won--and they won big. Jan Usinger, who would have seen only $6 in tax relief from the child credit under the House bill, will now get a tax break of $1,500 in the final bill negotiated between the President and Congress. That's no small change when you consider the cost of clothing, school supplies and child care. 
The final tax relief compromise enacted last week is a significant victory for the Usingers, and for the millions of working and middle-income families like them across the country. Some of the more helpful provisions in the bill will help offset the cost of raising children, make college more affordable, and even help adults go back to school for more training. There is also a $24 billion set-aside to provide health insurance to more children from working families now unable to afford it. 
The child tax credit tops the list of provisions New Mexico families will find most helpful. This new child credit will be available to families earning between $15,000 and $30,000, as well as those making between $30,000 to $150,000 a year. The size of the credit will vary according to the number of children and parents in the family, along with other factors. 
Best of all, the credit can be used to reduce a family's total federal tax burden--whether it's income taxes or federal payroll taxes. This is a key change from earlier versions of the bill, and it will make a big difference for the nearly three-quarters of lower-income working Americans who pay more payroll taxes than income taxes. Furthermore, employers will be instructed to make adjustments on withholding forms so that families can see the benefit of this credit as soon as possible. 
While the economic benefits of a college-educated workforce have increased tremendously over recent years, the financial obstacles have increased even faster. To help make higher education more accessible, the tax bill now includes a $1,500 tax credit for the first two years of college, and a credit of up to $1,000 for students after their first two years of college. Together, these credits would cover nearly all the costs of the average public college in the U.S. Workers can also receive up to $5,250 in employer-provided training each year, without having to count the benefit as taxable income. At a time when workers must continually update their skills, this break will help them get the training they need to make it in today's job market. 
Finally, a major source of economic anxiety for working families is the cost of medical care. Almost 150,000 New Mexico children are without health insurance, and many of them come from working families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to afford health insurance for their children. The provision setting aside $24 billion for expanding children's health insurance was designed with these working families in mind. It will provide states like New Mexico the resources to cover these children, giving them access to everything from routine checkups and antibiotics to emergency medical care. This provision will help more kids develop into healthy adults, and it will do so without imposing unworkable new federal mandates. 
It's important to note that this tax relief would not be possible or responsible, were we not on the brink of balancing the federal budget. In 1992, our nation ran a whopping $290 billion budget deficit, which has been shaved down to an estimated $45 billion this year. I think it is fair to say that if our country had not tightened its belt in the 1993 budget package to achieve this deficit reduction, interest rates would probably be higher, unemployment higher, and our economic growth slower. Now the people who helped sacrifice to get us to the point where we are today--like the 70 percent of New Mexicans earning under $30,000 a year--are getting some deserved tax relief. 
This tax deal is not perfect, and it certainly hasn't done much to make the tax code any simpler. But this final compromise does deliver where it matters. It provides relief not just to upper-income families but to the many new, young families in New Mexico who are working hard to deliver a decent quality of life to their children and to provide the educational opportunities and health care support that will lay a strong foundation for their success. In the end, this bill helps us invest in all of our children--and for this reason I think we have actually achieved something worthwhile this week in Washington. 
Mr. President, I do need to make references as well about certain provisions in this tax bill which are very good for small businesses in New Mexico as well as around the nation. 
First, the bill reinstates the home office business deduction, which I know is a very important issue for many self-employed people in our state and many other small business owners. 
This legislation also includes an important provision phasing in an increase in the self-employed health insurance deduction. The percentage of the deduction in 1997 is now at 40%, but it rises to 100% by the year 2007. 
Also, many businesses benefit by investing in continuing education programs for their employees, and this tax bill extends for three more years the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance. 
It also provides an enhanced deduction which businesses can claim for the donation of computers and technology to schools. 
Also, very importantly, a provision has been included that I have been working with a number of Senators over the last year. This provision builds on a small business initiative included in the 1993 budget plan. The original legislation stated that gains from stock held more than five years in publicly traded firms with assets less than $50 million would be taxed after the sale of stock at 50% of the capital gains tax rate. The new provision allows this gain to be rolled over into other small businesses of the same size on a fully tax-deferred basis. 
This will hopefully keep more capital in the small business sector. Overcoming venture capital deficiencies in New Mexico is one of the major hurdles that our state constantly faces. Hopefully, this provision will do some good for our state. 
Furthermore, small businesses with average gross receipts of less than $5 million will be exempt from the corporate alternative minimum tax. This covers a great majority of New Mexico companies. 
Also in the estate tax area, owners of qualified family owned businesses and farms will be able to exclude--starting next year--up to $1.3 million of their estate from inheritance tax. This is a very big provision--particularly as the general estate tax will be incrementally increased from $600,000 to $1 million by the year 2006. This family-owned estate tax relief puts the entire exclusion in place next year. The requirements are that the family owned business or farm must be at least 50% of the estate and heirs must participate in the business for 10 years after descendent's death. This provision will help a great number of small firms, farms, and ranches pass on to their heirs estates which often have a vast majority of their value tied up in the business. The failure to provide this exclusion in the past has unfortunately forced some families to liquidate businesses after the principal owner died. 
Also on the farm front, farmers who often face years of boom and bust are provided the option of 3-year income averaging for the next two years. I suppose we are going to see if this provides relief to farmers and consider whether to extend this option in the years that follow. 
Finally, the tax deal also includes extension of the research and experimentation credit for another year as well as it extends the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) through June, 1998. This provision is particularly important to our state's jewelry firms that import some of their stones and materials from lesser-developed countries. 
These are some of the items that I feel that small businesses should know about. If you download the actual bill from the World Wide Web, Mr. President (the address is http://speakernews.house.gov/taxfull.htm), you'll be printing 304 pages. My staff had to do this, in fact. Hopefully, by highlighting these items, some small businesses won't be completely dependent on H&R Block and the various computer tax packages that sort out this material. 
I recognize that if the standard of living is going to increase for citizens of this state, small business is going to be the primary engine in that effort. In any case, I am happy to report and restate that I think we have actually achieved something worthwhile this week in Washington.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to extend the boundaries of the Bandelier National Monument. Since 1916 when President Wilson created the monument to protect the `archeological resources of a vanished people,' both Congress and the President have adjusted the monument's boundaries on numerous occasions to protect these treasures, and the ecological balance within the monument. The latest example was in 1976, when Congress set aside over 70 percent of the monument to create the Bandelier Wilderness area. Because we have acted to conserve this valuable land in the past, today's visitors to the monument, the people of New Mexico and Americans from around the Nation, have a wonderful place to go to. In the same morning you can see varieties of wildlife, including herds of elk and deer, and explore the homes of early native American peoples. This bill continues that foresighted tradition of protection. 
The greatest threat to the monument at this time is potential development in the upper watershed that drains into the park. Not only could this impair the esthetic experience of visitors to the monument, it could seriously harm the ecological balance within the monument. The potential for soil erosion, flooding, and siltation of streams from upstream development is of grave concern, and this bill seeks to address the problem. Under this bill the boundaries of the monument would be extended to include all of the lands which are not currently in public ownership in the upper Alamo watershed which drains into the monument. 
This bill will allow the Park Service to enter into agreements with private landowners to either purchase their land, or to restrict the development of their land in order to protect the monument. I want to note that the current landowners support this, and have stated that they would like to enter into such agreements that will protect the monument for future generations. Because of this, I have written this bill to give the Park Service authority to enter into contracts with willing sellers. This bill does not give the Park Service condemnation authority. 
Mr. President, because we have a situation where we can protect this treasure for generations to come with the help and cooperation of the private landowners that neighbor the monument, I am pleased to offer this bill.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a subject that is very important to the people of New Mexico; not just the Hispanic community, but people of all ethnicities that value the rich, historical traditions of our State. Today, I am proud to be co-sponsoring with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, legislation that will finally make possible the creation of an Hispanic Cultural Center. The Center has been in the planning stages for many years and, when completed, will be the product of very hard work by numerous people in New Mexico. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his work and Senator Kennedy, Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, and Senator Gorton for their efforts to make this Center a reality, and I congratulate them. 
Mr. President, the United States and New Mexico have enjoyed an enriched legacy of Hispanic tradition and culture. New Mexico especially can be proud of strong Hispanic participation in politics, government, economic development, and cultural expression. Hispanic presence in the United States reaches far back to 1528, and in New Mexico to 1539. Hispanic influence on our society can be seen all across our state, in our architecture, food, clothing, literature, music, family tradition, and even the names of many of our towns and cities; names like `Alamogordo,' `Raton,' `Quemado,' and `Penasco.' Since the time that Don Juan de Onate first settled New Mexico in 1598, Hispanic families have been a part of the New Mexico landscape. Today, we can look forward to a Center that will showcase this rich tradition, and it will serve as a living tribute to the Hispanic experience for all citizens of our Nation. 
Regrettably, our Federal Government has done too little to recognize that the Hispanic community has been present on this continent for 500 years and has been an integral fiber in our Nation's fabric. The Hispanic culture has made and continues to make many valuable contributions to our society as a whole. Hispanics make up the fastest growing minority group in this country. The Census Bureau reports that Hispanics presently account for 11 percent of our Nation's population, and by 2025 it will have accounted for 44 percent of the national population growth. 
Certainly, the Center will promote a better understanding of Hispanics, and, more importantly, will serve as a showcase of how New Mexico is a place where many cultures, including Anglo, Native American, and African American, live and work together in magnificent harmony. This legislation is an important first step by our Federal Government to long-delayed recognition. 
There is still much work to be done to make this Center a reality, however. Construction on the facility will begin, and the location of the Center is presently being determined. I strongly encourage all concerned parties to work together to ensure that the spirit of the Center remains intact. 
Again, Mr. President, on behalf of the people of New Mexico, I thank the distinguished Senators.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from the State of Kansas, Senator Roberts, in introducing a bill that will enable two Tribal Colleges to pursue their missions without the burden of unnecessary Federal regulations. Like Haskell Indian Nations University, the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute of Albuquerque (SIPI) is one of about 30 Tribal Colleges that is supported by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Many of the students at these colleges are the first in their families to attend college, and having a Tribal College near their home and in tune with their tradition is critical to their education and economic success. Both Haskell and SIPI have grown in academic stature in the past few decades. SIPI recently marked its 25th anniversary and adopted a Master Plan that will guide the growth of its programs and facilities beyond the year 2000. 
A recent report by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching entitled `Native American Colleges: Progress and Prospects,' documents the critical role that these colleges play in offering Native Americans access to higher education. This report also traces the history of the relationship between the Federal government and Tribal Colleges. Haskell and SIPI are the only Tribal Colleges that are administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and as a result are bound by the personnel regulations that apply to Federal agencies. At one time, this policy made sense and allowed these two universities to establish an administrative infrastructure and academic programs. But as the Carnegie Foundation report points out, the relationship between the Federal government and Tribal Colleges should evolve as the institutions take on more self-determination. The time has come to enact legislation that reflects the growth of these institutions. 
The Federal personnel regulations imposed on SIPI and Haskell are inappropriate for institutions of higher education and are not recognized by accreditation organizations. This bill would allow Haskell and SIPI to establish independent authority over their personnel policies and practices. There is a world of difference between a Federal agency and a thriving institution of higher education, and these differences should be reflected in their personnel classification, pay systems, and policies for hiring and promotion. SIPI needs the authority to hire and promote faculty and staff on the basis of their intellect and the excellence of their teaching, research, and service to the institution.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Indian Reservation School Roads Maintenance Act of 1997. This bill, which is being cosponsored by my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, addresses a unique situation with respect to roads in and around Indian reservations and nearby counties that is actually preventing children from getting to and from school safely. Because of the unique nature of this situation, it can only be addressed at the Federal level. 
I would like to start with an example of this unique problem and why I believe a Federal solution is necessary. As you can see, Mr. President, this first chart is a map of the Navajo Reservation in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. The Navajo Nation is by far the Nation's largest Indian reservation, covering 25,000 square miles. To give you an idea of its size, there are 10 States that are smaller than this reservation. For instance, it is the same size as the State of West Virginia. 
According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, there are 9,000 miles of roads that serve the Navajo Nation. Only one-fifth of these roads are paved--the rest, over 7,000 miles, are dirt roads. The schoolbuses have to use nearly all of the 9,000 miles of roads each and every day to get the kids to and from school. 
About 6,400 miles of these roads on the reservation are BIA roads and over 2,500 miles are State and county roads. All public roads within, adjacent to, or leading to the reservation, including BIA, State, and county roads, are considered part of the Indian reservation road system. However, only BIA roads are eligible for Federal maintenance funding from BIA, and generally, construction and improvement funding from the Federal Lands Highways Program in ISTEA is applied to BIA roads. On the other hand, States and counties are responsible for maintenance and improvement of their roads. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government is asking the States and counties to bear too large a burden for road maintenance in this unique situation, given the resources most of these counties have. For example, counties around the Navajo Reservation are predominantly comprised of Federal or tribal lands. Three-quarters of McKinley County in my State of New Mexico is either tribal or Federal land, including BLM, Forest Service, and military. This next map is of McKinley County, and as you can see, Mr. President, everything shown on this map that is either orange, yellow, green, or red, is tribal or Federal land. The Indian land area alone comprises 61 percent of the county. As you can see, everything else is county land, which is a very small fraction of total land area. Therefore, there is a very small tax base on which the county can rely as a source of revenue for maintenance purposes. The picture for San Juan County in the northwest corner of New Mexico is very much the same. 
Mr. President, families living in and around the reservation are no different from families anywhere else; their children are entitled to the same opportunity to get to school safely and get a good education. However, the miles and miles of unpaved, deficient roads in this vast area are frequently impassable. If the schoolbuses don't get through, the kids simply cannot get to school. 
Of the 600 miles of county-maintained roads in McKinley County, 550 miles serve Indian land. Because of the vastness of the reservation, this is a cost that the counties in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah simply cannot and should not have to bear without Federal assistance. Indeed, because of the large tribal and Federal presence in these counties, it is encumbent upon the Federal Government to provide this assistance. 
What my bill does is set aside $10 million from the highway trust fund that counties such as these can apply for to help maintain the roads used by schoolbuses to carry children to school or to a Headstart program. Let me be very clear: these Federal funds can be used only on roads that are located within, or that lead to the reservation, that are on the State or county maintenance system, and that are used by schoolbuses. 
Let me just state again, Mr. President, that maintaining schoolbus routes in this vast area is a unique problem that only the Federal Government can effectively deal with. 
I don't believe any child wanting to get to and from school safely should have to risk or tolerate unsafe roads. Kids today, particularly in rural areas, already face enough barriers to getting a good education. I ask all Senators to join with me in assuring that all schoolchildren at least have a chance to get to school safely and have an opportunity for an education. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, as I understand it. 
That amendment, if it were adopted, would essentially prohibit the Advanced Technology Program, which is administered through the Department of Commerce, from allowing participation of large companies. 
Let me give you my own understanding of how the Advanced Technology Program works. I think it has been an extremely useful program. It has helped to keep the United States at the forefront of technology development and high-technology industry development in the world, and, to a significant degree, our leadership in that arena, in that area of high technology, is the reason why we enjoy the strong economy we enjoy today. 
So I believe the Advanced Technology Program is useful. It has been a great help to many companies. It has been a great help in helping us, as a country, create jobs in the industries of the future. 
In order for that program to succeed, though, we need to be sure that taxpayer funds are provided, and they are only a very small portion of the total funds that go into these technology development activities, but they are a catalyst. They bring together companies. They bring together research institutions to do this important work. Those funds also provide a bridge between the Government-funded research and the private-sector research, so that we have national laboratories, such as the two in my State, Los Alamos and Sandia, and we have many large and small companies working together to make breakthroughs in technology. 
It is essential, if this program is going to succeed, that we allow the Advanced Technology Program to put the funds where the most good can be done and we not begin to structure this program as though it was some kind of a jobs program or as though it is a doling out of funds to different corporate interests. It is not that. It is an effort by the Federal Government to stimulate cooperative research in areas that show great promise. 
Sometimes the people doing that work are in large companies. Sometimes there are a few individuals in a large company who are doing very important work and can benefit from collaborating with researchers in small companies or researchers in national laboratories or researchers in universities around this country. 
I think it would be a great mistake for us to begin to limit the companies that can participate in the Advanced Technology Program. To do so would begin to move us down the road toward mediocrity in the technologies that are developed through use of these public funds, and I believe that is a very major mistake. 
I know that there have been criticisms over the past that any time the Federal Government invests dollars in research and development activities that private sector companies are engaged in, that somehow or another that is corporate welfare. I strongly disagree with that point of view. I think the taxpayers are well served if we can invest in developing technologies that will create jobs, will produce revenue, will produce additional tax revenue in the future and will keep our economy the strongest in the world. 
I very much hope that the Senate will reject the Brownback amendment when it is finally voted on, and I hope we will allow this Advanced Technology Program to continue to be the great engine of innovation and technology development that it has been in recent years.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is basically a sunshine provision that would require nonprofit public affairs organizations to register with the Attorney General if such organizations receive contributions in excess of $10,000 from foreign governments in any 12-month period. 
This provision would not affect churches, hospitals, or other nonprofit, 501(c)3 organizations which are not focused on public policy matters. In fact, this amendment only affects those public policy nonprofit organizations that do accept foreign government money. 
Furthermore, this amendment does not prohibit or object to such foreign government contributions. It only requires that organizations publicly acknowledge such contributions--when they are over a threshold of $10,000 a year from all foreign government sources--by registering this information with the Attorney General under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. 
Mr. President, I'm sure that many of my colleagues may be wondering what triggered the need for this legislation. Let me state that this amendment is not directed at any particular organization or nonprofit entity. This is simply a common-sense provision that will help make the public affairs environment healthier by the disclosure of when foreign government money is supporting a given nonprofit public affairs organization and when not. 
These nonprofit organizations are organized for the public good and they are subsidized by the American people. To the degree that these organizations are weighing in on important public policy matters--particularly on our Nation's economic policies and defense strategies, but also in other public policy areas--and are receiving foreign government contributions to support their activities, I believe that the American public has the right to know that such foreign government contributions have been made to that organization. 
Members of Congress and their staff meet regularly with representatives of many nonprofit public affairs organizations--which are permitted to engage in public education activities on the Hill. But while some organizations like the Japan Economic Institute and Korea Economic Institute are quite straightforward about their primary funding sources and register with the Attorney General that their sources of funding are foreign governments, some other nonprofit public affairs organizations actually try to keep from public view the fact that they receive substantial foreign government revenue. 
When these groups meet with Members of Congress and staff, mail information all around the country, and organize public affairs events without ever disclosing the fact that their funding comes from other countries' national governments, something is wrong. 
Mr. President, this amendment has a different target than the discussions going on about campaign finance reform. It is focused on a rather narrow window in the law which allows some nonprofits to be bolstered by foreign government funds while not having to be upfront with the broader public. 
I believe that our public policy process can only benefit by the disclosure that this legislation would require. And I trust that my colleagues will agree and hope that they will support this amendment which I am offering today.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what the amendment is. The amendment which I am offering along with Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Energy Committee, would strike section 630 out of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill which is pending before the Senate. The reason we are trying to strike section 630 is that it would impede Federal agencies from using energy conservation programs that are now being offered to all customers by electric utility companies. This section would override both the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the National Defense Authorization Act of 1993. There is nothing anticompetitive about eliminating section 630. Many energy conservation measures, such as agreements to use certain amounts of energy at certain times of the day, can only be made--those types of agreements can only be made with the local utility. 
We are in a period where we are moving toward a restructured electric utility industry, but we are not there yet. In most parts of this country today, customers still deal with one electric utility. So the opportunity to enter into these energy conservation measures is with that one electric utility. If there is only one source offering a particular service--in this case the providing of electricity--there is no point in outlawing a sole-source procurement, as section 630 would do. 
Existing law tells Federal agencies to use energy conservation services offered by local utilities if those same services are offered to other customers in that same location. This amendment overrides section 630 of the bill, which we are dealing with here and which we are trying to eliminate. It would override these mandates and would have the following negative consequences. 
First of all, there are 58 existing contracts between the General Services Administration and utilities that will be adversely affected by this provision, according to the Department of Energy. Second, the Department of Defense will be forced to scrap its model energy conservation agreement that it has with members of the utility industry. 
Since the law allows sole-source contracts, and since the sole source is sometimes the only option for the Government, section 630 is not about making agencies comply with the law; it is about the Senate intervening on one side of an electric industry dispute without having all of the facts. Energy conservation law is obviously complex. We should not be trying to change this law in an appropriations bill. Before we change the law, we need to hear from all of the affected parties. 
The chairman of the Energy Committee, who is cosponsoring my amendment, has agreed to hold hearings on the concerns raised by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Given that good-faith offer to investigate and resolve these concerns, I believe the Senate should support our amendment and take out section 630 until we have all the facts.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Murkowski and I have offered strikes section 630 of the bill. If enacted, section 630 would foreclose all Federal agencies from taking advantage of energy conservation programs offered by their local utility company. I believe section 630 would needlessly restrict an option that helps the Federal Government, the Nation's largest energy user, implement cost-effective energy-savings programs at Federal facilities. 
Mr. President, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 set a goal of reducing by 20 percent the average energy consumed by the Federal Government. Federal facilities were given various approaches for reducing energy consumption. For example, an agency can sign an energy savings performance contract with an energy service company, or it can work with the local utility company to take advantage of utility-sponsored energy conservation measures. Under current law, Federal agencies may select the option that is best for their situation. 
It is important to have this flexibility because working with the private sector to reduce a facility's energy use is not an ordinary procurement. Purchasing energy efficiency isn't like buying paper clips or furniture. The Federal Energy Management Program has made substantial progress in streamlining the contracting process for energy management services at Federal facilities. If an agency chooses to work with the local utility company, it may go directly to the utility on a sole-source basis to obtain the energy efficiency and management services that are available to all utility customers. In most cases, the utility teams with energy service companies to maximize cost-effective energy savings for the Government. 
Section 630 would eliminate the option of working with the local utility. If section 630 remains in the bill, Federal agencies will not be able to take advantage of the financial incentives, goods, or services generally available to all other customers of the utility. This could represent literally millions of dollars lost to the taxpayers. Section 630 
could also prevent payments on existing energy management contracts between Federal agencies and utilities. 
Over the years, I have spoken frequently here on the critical need for Federal agencies to make better efforts to reduce their energy use. According to a recent GAO report, the taxpayers' electric bill for Federal facilities is more than $3.5 billion a year. There is no question we could be saving a substantial portion of this amount through cost-effective energy measures that frequently have payback times less than 10 years. I am pleased to see the substantial progress now being made. 
For example, the Government's largest single energy user is the Department of Defense, which accounts for half of all Federal electricity consumption. The Department is now on a track to save up to $1 billion per year in total energy spending by the year 2005. The Department of Defense believes section 630 would significantly reduce its authority and opportunity to take advantage of private sector energy conservation expertise and capital, and would, in fact, seriously reduce the amount of work offered to all sectors of the energy community.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Earlier, I described the options available to Federal agencies to secure energy management services. If I could Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to give two examples demonstrating that the program is on the right track and illustrating the risks of hasty and ill-considered changes. 
The first example is the New Mexico initiative from my home state. The General Services Administration has a contract with a local utility, Public Service Co. of New Mexico, that covers the Federal facilities in PNM's service territory. Under the terms of this agreement, PNM partners with energy service companies on a competitive basis to implement the actual energy-saving measures. This initiative is expected to result in $60 million in new investments in conservation and energy efficiency technologies. The initial pilot project is at the White Sands Missile Range, where I understand that substantial reductions of energy and water use have been achieved. This successful program would be terminated if section 630 were enacted. 
The other option available to Federal agencies is to contract with energy service companies. I understand there may be concerns that these companies are left out of the Federal Energy Management Program when the agencies choose to work with their local utilities. Mr. President, I don't believe this is the case. An article from the May 22, 1997, New York Times describes the Department of Energy's awarding of five competitive contracts worth up to $750 million dollars. These contracts cover Federal buildings in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The winning companies include energy service companies such as Honeywell, Inc., and Johnson Controls. Five more awards are planned over the next 2 years for a total contract value of $5 billion. It seems to me

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, these are but two examples from the Federal Energy Management Program. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 simplified the contracting procedures Federal agencies may use to implement energy conservation measures. The last thing we should be doing is eliminating options. We should be striving for maximum flexibility and not hamstringing the agencies as they strive for substantial progress. 
Mr. President, last week the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee stated that section 630 `reflects no change in the law' and that the section `directs federal agencies to abide by the law.' I must respectfully disagree with the chairman. Section 630 would make very substantial changes in energy-management measures enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which Senator Murkowski and I, and the other members of the Energy Committee, worked to pass. 
Last week, in speaking on section 630, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee listed what he stated were the provisions that are, in his view, relevant to Federal agency contracting programs for energy services. However, with all due respect Mr. President, the distinguished Chairman omitted the sections of the existing law that section 630 would overturn. In particular, section 152 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 describes the implementation options available to agencies. If I may, I'd like to read the exact text: Each agency shall `take maximum advantage of contracts authorized under subchapter VII of this chapter, of financial incentives and other services provided by utilities for efficiency investment, and of other forms of financing to reduce the direct costs of Government * * *.' 
Section 630 would effectively eliminate the option for Federal agencies to work with utilities, receive any available financial incentives, or take advantage of attractive forms of financing. This would be a bad deal for the taxpayer. 
Another part of section 152 of the Energy Policy Act that section 630 would repeal specifically describes utility incentive programs:

<TEXT>
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have heard no arguments here as to why these good provisions should now be repealed. In addition, the Appropriations Committee's report offers no explanation of the need for section 630. 
Let me also observe that section 630 attempts to make these controversial changes in energy legislation through an appropriations bill. As far as I can tell, no formal notification to or consultation with the Energy Committee has taken place. I doubt that such a far-reaching change would be considered by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee without at least a hearing. 
The proponents of section 630 should have their views heard in the appropriate forum. I am recommending to the chairman of the Energy Committee that hearings be held so that we can get all the issues out on the table and, if changes are needed, come to a reasonable solution. 
In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and strike section 630.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the chance to speak again about my amendment. Let me take just a few minutes to describe what this amendment does and then reserve a couple of the 5 minutes that is allotted for my side for any rebuttal I need to make. 
This amendment is very modest. It tries to do three things. It is aimed at assisting the Cuban-American families that reside in our country, some of whom are citizens--some individuals are citizens, some are residents. It tries to assist in three respects. 
First of all, it says with regard to family support payments, that residents of the United States shall not be prohibited from sending to their parents, their siblings, their spouses, or their children who currently reside in Cuba, small amounts of money, not to exceed $200 per month, to be used for the purchase of basic necessities, including food, clothing, household supplies, rent, medicines, and medical care. 
Mr. President, I think this is self-explanatory. We had a policy until the shootdown of the plane some 2 years ago, nearly, at this point--we had a policy of permitting, I believe, $100 per month to be remitted by Cuban-Americans living in this country to their families in Cuba for these types of purposes. That is no longer permitted at any level. This amendment would say up to $200 per month could be sent by a person in this country to a family member in Cuba. 
Second, compassionate travel--that is the second item in this amendment. It says essentially that U.S. citizens and permanent residents here can travel without limitation for periods not to exceed 30 days for each trip to attend either a medical emergency or a funeral of that person's parent, sibling, spouse, or child. As I understand it, the present law in this country is that you can go to Cuba for a very short time once a year, if you are a resident of this country, for this kind of purpose. It doesn't take a great deal of ingenuity to conjure up a situation where you would have a person's parent getting sick, having a medical emergency that required that person to return early in the year, and then have a funeral later that year which would require a return again to Cuba. This amendment says that you could do both of those trips. Neither could be more than 30 days in duration. It is a very limited provision. It is only applicable to people who have spouses, parents, siblings, and children in Cuba. 
And the third item here, which I think is not just aimed at the Cuban-American community, it says that the United States Government shall not be prohibited from participating in humanitarian relief efforts of multilateral organizations of which the United States is a member, where such humanitarian relief efforts are made in the aftermath of a natural disaster in Cuba. 
All we are saying here is that if there is a hurricane, if there is some natural catastrophe in Cuba, and multilateral organizations that we are a member of decide to take some action to assist the Cuban people, then we can participate along with the other members of that multilateral organization. 
As I indicated when I started, this is a very, very modest amendment. It is trying to deal with some very specific problems I see in our current law, and I would very much appreciate it if our colleagues could agree to this amendment. I understand it is objectionable, and I will, at this point, yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time to allow the opponents of the amendment to explain why this is going to undermine our great democracy. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me conclude by saying I am not trying to change United States policy toward Cuba. I am not trying to provide assistance to Fidel Castro. I am not trying to send a signal that Fidel Castro is a favorite statesman of this country. I do think it is appropriate for us to separate out the concerns of Cuban-American citizens and residents from this geopolitical issue, and say these modest efforts to assist Cuban-American citizens and residents to help their families and to visit their families are not something that a great nation like ours should resist. 
Clearly, the humanitarian assistance my colleague from Florida cites that we have done is in the private sector. There is no public sector assistance at this time. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment. 
While I have the floor, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska as a cosponsor of my amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say this whole issue of most-favored-nation status is not what the name implies. We have normal trading relations with well over 100 countries in the world, and as to each of those countries, we have so-called most-favored-nation trading status with them. 
What we need to maintain with China is a normalized trading situation which then allows us to deal with the specific problems that the proponents of this resolution have identified. I agree that there are major problems in the trade imbalance that we have with China, that there are human rights abuses in China that are of concern, that there is missile proliferation that is of concern, and clearly the issue that is being raised about possible involvement by the Chinese Government in our elections is of concern. But those are specific issues that should be dealt with by a rifle-shot approach. We should not try to cut off our trade activities with a very large economy, such as China, and hamper the economic opportunities of our own private sector and the job creation that comes from that in this country through this kind of device. 
So I very much oppose the notion that we should deny most-favored-nation status to China. I think we should get that issue behind us and get on to dealing with the more specific issues that do require attention in regard to our relations with China. I hope in future years we can do that. It seems like we are caught in a time war. We get to where we have an annual debate about most-favored-nation status and that is all we seem to be able to have when it comes to talking about China, and that is, unfortunately, what is happening again this year.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say one more word about the amendment with regard to most-favored-nation status for China. 
My own strong impression is that with regard to Russia and most of the other major nations we deal with, we have a series of concerns that we deal with on a concern-by-concern basis, a case-by-case basis. And that is exactly what we should do. 
In the case of China, unfortunately, our debate has gotten to where it is sort of all or nothing, we are either going to have most-favored-nation status or we are not. And that is a very blunt instrument with which to try to deal with a very important and complex relationship. I believe it would be a great mistake for us to deny most-favored-nation status to China. 
I hope very much the amendment is rejected.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I cannot support Senator Smith's amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill, S. 955, which we are debating here today. 
I believe that Senator Smith and others in this Chamber who vote in favor of this amendment have good intentions, but this amendment is not structured in a manner that I can support. This amendment would prohibit the United States from issuing foreign aid to the Government of Russia should it enact laws which would discriminate against minority religious faiths in the Russian federation. On the surface, this is a very well intentioned effort. 
I understand and completely support the fundamental importance and right of religious freedom, a constitutionally protected right in our Nation, as I also appreciate the importance of other freedoms that we hold dear in the United States such as the freedom of speech and freedom to assemble. 
However, Russia and many other nations have not organized their nations to provide the same degree of freedoms that our Nation provides. This is not an excuse for other countries; it is just simple fact. To tie our Nation's foreign aid decisions too closely to legislative outcomes in other countries--even absolutely egregious ones like the Russian law which recently passed the Duma restricting recognized faiths to those recognized by the former Soviet Union before 1984, including Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Judaism--can have serious unintended consequences and disrupt national security objectives of our Nation. Through legislative actions such as this one which we are considering today, we can actually trigger the enactment of outrageous laws in other nations which could seriously damage the existing freedoms that citizens in other nations have. 
We should realize that many other nations--including Israel, Egypt, Turkey, and other recipients of United States aid--would lose that aid if held to the same standard that we are proposing for Russia. Perhaps this is something that we should discuss here. But my sense is that we don't want a single measuring stick--and that today, we are focusing on Russia in a rather knee-jerk fashion. Russia needs to hear our concerns about religious freedoms, and I feel that we should pursue this matter and communicate United States objections to this Russian law in the many different arenas available to us in our engagement with Russia. However, this vehicle--as it is constructed--is not appropriate and could send matters in a negative rather than positive direction. 
I think that the most important item left out of the drafting of this amendment is a national security waiver, which would permit the President to waive the provisions of this bill in cases where American national security were at stake. If this provision had been included, I may have viewed this amendment more positively. 
Again, I believe firmly in the innate human right to worship as each individual sees fit. However, in my opinion, not only is this particular foreign aid provision an inappropriate vehicle to send that message abroad but it also ties the hands of the President in the execution of foreign policy and fails to allow for waivers which may very well be in the national security interests of the United States.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have just sent to the desk is a very simple amendment that would provide that the President shall not restrict travel to Cuba by United States citizens and other people who are lawfully subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, except in circumstances where we are at war or where there are armed hostilities in or around Cuba, or where there is imminent danger to public health or physical safety of United States travelers in Cuba. 
My own view is that our policy today, toward Cuba, is a holdover from the cold war. It is an anachronism. It is out of step with the sentiments of the American people. And it is certainly out of step with the best interests of our own country. 
We have gotten into a situation where the only attention that is given to our relations with Cuba is that every 6 months the President comes forward and once again waives certain extraterritorial provisions that were part of the Helms-Burton Act that was passed last year; and at the same time that it waives those provisions, it assures Members of Congress and the Cuban-American community that it plans to maintain a posture of tough sanctions against Cuba. So any efforts that might be undertaken to promote a constructive and humanitarian engagement with Cuba, or at least some level of humanitarian assistance to those in need in Cuba, all of that has been put aside and lost, unfortunately, in our discussion of Cuban-American relations. 
When the Helms-Burton Act passed the Congress, Walter Russell Mead wrote an article in the New Yorker that I think sums things up pretty well. He said: 
Fidel Castro has survived the enmity of nine American Presidents. In concert with his enemies in South Florida, he retains a hypnotic ability to induce stupidity in Yankee policymakers. That seems unlikely to change until the U.S. Government gets around to taking control of its Cuba policy away from a small, self-interested lobby group. 
Mr. President, I share Mr. Mead's views on this anachronistic stance that we continue to take toward Cuba. 
In my opinion, the one reason that Castro has remained entrenched and has survived nine American Presidents is that he continues to be able to point to the United States as a menacing foreign presence and to call upon the Cuban people to withstand the hardships that they have to withstand because of bad intentions and actions by America, as he would have it. 
If people, including so many of my distinguished colleagues across the aisle and on the Democratic side, believe in the value of Radio Marti and TV Marti, our broadcasting operations in Florida, which are intended to inform Cubans about the way of life in the United States and our freedoms and our liberties, then certainly increasing contact by allowing travel by Americans to Cuba would do even more. I think it is important that the administration and others realize that the Helms-Burton Act and this 6-month clock on issuing a waiver on the worst provisions of that act not be allowed to serve as the be all and the end all of our Cuban policy. 
On June 19 of this year, I joined Senator Dodd and a great many other Senators in writing to the President urging that direct flights to Cuba for the purpose of humanitarian assistance be permitted. The subject of that letter is not the subject of my amendment today. I cite that as one example of an effort to improve constructive relations between ourselves and Cuba and to assist in humanitarian needs that are real. 
I do believe that one of the least justifiable aspects of our policy toward Cuba today is the restrictions that we place on travel by U.S. citizens and U.S. residents to that country. The right to travel is a constitutional right. It is one that the courts have recognized. It is one that we, as a country, have recognized and that we only interfere with where there is a national security reason or some overriding national interest that requires that we interfere with that free right of travel. 
I attended a conference, Asia Pacific Forum, 2 weeks ago at the Kennedy School in Boston. There were some Chinese leaders there and some Korean leaders and some Japanese leaders, and I was struck by the story that I heard from one of the Chinese leaders, the head of the Chinese delegation. He had been one of those singled out for abuse during the cultural revolution when that occurred in China a couple of decades ago. 
He was taken from his hometown, from Beijing, at that time where he was a prominent leader in the university, and he was sent to a very remote part of China and forced to work there. He worked in a factory for 10 years during the cultural revolution in a very lowly position. At the end of the cultural revolution, he was allowed to take a more responsible position and, once again, begin to demonstrate and use his talents, but he stayed in that factory for an additional 5 years after the 10 years that was required during the cultural revolution. 
I asked, `Why did you stay in that part of China? Why didn't you come back to Beijing?" 
He said, `I didn't have a permit. I wasn't permitted to travel.' You couldn't just travel. You weren't permitted, at that time at least, to travel in China without a permit. 
Mr. President, that refusal to allow people to travel is characteristic of Communist, authoritarian regimes. It is not characteristic of the United States. It should not be our policy to keep American citizens and American residents from traveling, except where national security requires it. Clearly, there is no national security justification for us continuing to prevent travel to Cuba by Americans today. 
Let me also just point out this restriction against travel is an invitation to abuse. We have a lot of people in business in this country, in Canada, in Mexico and in various nearby countries who make it their business to facilitate travel to Cuba by United States citizens. 
We made a little search of the Web. You are supposed to search the Web whenever you want to find out anything these days. So we got on the Internet. Here is a provision, Intra Kensington Travel. It says: `Cuba travel for U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens holding valid passports are welcomed as visitors to Cuba for purposes of tourism. Many U.S. citizens visit Cuba each year for this purpose.' 
This is what the advertisement on the Web said: `When you arrive in Cuba, ensure that your passport is not stamped. Instead, have the Cuban immigration officials stamp a separate sheet of paper and be sure to bring this with you, so your passport won't be stamped. To avoid difficulty with U.S. Immigration and Customs authorities, do not return to the United States with any evidence that you have ever visited Cuba. This would include cigars, rum, souvenir T-shirts, postcards, tourist information and other items.' 
Mr. President, this restriction is not enforceable. It is being abused. It is an embarrassment to a great nation like ours that we have this restriction in our law. I believe strongly that we should eliminate it. The amendment I sent to the desk would do that. 
Let me also say, though, for purposes of reality in the Senate, that we have had a vote on this amendment before, essentially this same amendment. Former Senator Simon from Illinois offered this same amendment in the last Congress. I supported his efforts. I am sad to report that we only received 25 votes for the effort to eliminate these restrictions. 
So this year, Mr. President, I would like to offer a different amendment and see if we can't get more support. Let me, at this point, Mr. President, withdraw my amendment and send another amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment addresses an important need of the Congress created by the demise, two years ago, of the Office of Technology Assessment. That need is for authoritative and in-depth studies of scientific and technological issues that are at the root of many of the problems that we are called on to address through legislation. 
Over the 23 years of its existence, from 1972 to 1995, the Office of Technology Assessment functioned as our in-house brain trust. It was a competent, timely, and impartial source of scientific and technical advice on a wide range of issues. In early 1995, the decision was made to end the existence of the Office of Technology Assessment by zeroing out its appropriation. The judgment of the Congress at that time was that it needed to demonstrate to the American people that it was willing to downsize its own operations. I miss the OTA, and I know that a lot of my colleagues in the Senate and in the House do too. I am not proposing today to reverse what we did 2 years ago by recreating new offices in the Congress or by hiring new permanent staff. I believe that there are other, more flexible ways for Congress to gain direct access to high-quality and timely advice and insight on cutting edge science and technology relevant to our legislative duties. 
My amendment attempts to use the existing legislative authorities for oversight of the old OTA to oversee a new pilot experiment. Members should realize that while we terminated the OTA by ending its appropriation, the underlying authorities governing the OTA are still on the books. For example, there is continuing legislative authority in title 2 of the United States Code to have a Technology Assessment Board of 12 members: 6 from the House and 6 from the Senate, with each chamber's representation evenly divided between the parties and appointed by the respective leadership. This is an excellent group to decide on which topics should be studied using the funds that would be provided by my amendment. The old OTA authorities also provided that topics for OTA studies be suggested by chairs of committees, ranking members, or numerical majorities of committees, or by the Technology Assessment Board. That is a sound procedure for identifying potential study topics. My amendment uses both of these authorities, but contains a crucial difference in how the studies are executed. In place of a permanent, continuing organization to undertake studies, my amendment provides for selection of external scientific, technological, or educational institutions to carry out the studies that would be funded under my amendment. Think of it as a `virtual OTA' or, if you prefer, an `outsourced' one. The contractual arrangements with these institutions would be handled by the GAO, which already has a wide network of similar contracting arrangements with accounting firms all over the country. Thus, there is no institutional mortgage associated with my amendment, and no new Congressional organization. I think that every member who reluctantly voted to terminate the OTA, because of the need to downsize our operations, can support my amendment with a clear conscience. We aren't bringing back a big bureaucracy. We are giving ourselves access, on topics that Members themselves determine are the most pressing to have authoritative scientific and technical insight, to the analytical capabilities of our best not-for-profit and educational institutions. 
Let me reiterate the key points behind my amendment. I am proposing a way for Congress to acquire better scientific and technological advice without an institutional mortgage. My amendment puts 12 members, selected by the bipartisan leadership of the Senate and the House, directly in charge of deciding how the funds under this amendment will be spent and what will be studied. My amendment allows all Committees of Congress to nominate topics worthy of study and to propose which not-for-profit institution would be most suitable to engage in their study. Contracting would be handled through the General Accounting Office, which routinely contracts to external sources for expert advice and assistance in its own audits. 
I am proposing an experiment of limited scope, only $500,000, which probably translates to somewhere between two and five studies. The offsetting funds of $500,000 come from the budget of the General Accounting Office, which is receiving over $354 million in appropriations in this Act. That is less than three-tenths of 1 percent of the GAO budget for this experiment. The contracting burden for GAO under my amendment is hardly crushing--an additional 2 to 5 contracts won't stretch their resources. I will also note that the Appropriations Committee's own report for this bill voices concern that GAO may have given priority to audits initiated under its own authority over those requested by committees and Members of Congress. My amendment represents a use of funds that is 100 percent directed to Member and Committee requests, and overseen by a bipartisan group appointed by the leadership. 
I believe that this is a sensible request and I urge the adoption of my amendment. 
The amendment (No. 920) was agreed to.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of the additional funds provided to the Department of Energy for stockpile stewardship and stockpile maintenance under this appropriation bill. I do so both as someone who has followed nuclear weapons' issues for many years and as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which has authorizing jurisdiction over these funds. 
In testimony before the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, two compelling points were made about these programs. 
First, we are only beginning to learn how to certify the safety and reliability of the stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing. This Spring was the first time that the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy jointly made this certification. This procedure is now required by law to be completed each year. As time goes on and the nuclear weapons stockpile continues to age, our ability to certify the stockpile without testing will become more and more dependent on new science and technology that will emerge from the stockpile stewardship and stockpile management program. This conclusion was agreed to by all concerned--by Assistant Secretary Vic Reis on behalf of the Department of Energy and by General Habiger on behalf of the Strategic Command. 
Second, there is considerable skepticism here in the Senate and in the defense community that the science-based stockpile stewardship can succeed over the long term. There are many who believe that the design of nuclear weapons relies so much on art as opposed to science that we will inevitably have to return to underground nuclear testing. I hope that this is not true, and I believe that ending underground nuclear testing is so important a policy objective that we must give science-based stockpile stewardship every chance to succeed. While the President shares this concern, it must also be recognized that his budget request had to strike a balance on many different dimensions and that even within the Department of Energy programmatic tradeoffs had to be made. We received strong testimony in the Armed Services Committee that the President's request was not adequate in a number of areas receiving extra funds in this bill, and I think that there is a good case to be made for keeping those funds in this bill. 
For example, on the stockpile stewardship side, we had the following testimony from the Director of the Sandia National Laboratories: 
The costs of stockpile stewardship are not a linear function of stockpile size. A threshold capability will be needed to support the stockpile as long as it numbers in thousands, especially with the sophistication and demand for reliability that is associated with the systems on which deterrence rests today. I believe that we are near that threshold now, especially in light of the closures and changes that have occurred in recent years. 
I don't believe that we ought to be addressing the question of the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile by seeing how close we can get to the threshold at which we can no longer certify the safety and reliability of the stockpile. 
Another Director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, Dr. Bruce Tartar of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, had this to say: 
The greatest challenges [to stockpile stewardship] lie ahead. The demands on the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program will grow as weapons in the enduring stockpile continue to age. The U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile is now older on average than it has ever been. And, the reservoir of nuclear test and design experience at the laboratories continues to diminish. 
Further, on the stockpile management side, the DOE production plants that make nonnuclear components for the enduring stockpile are in sorry physical shape. Some 80 percent of the nonnuclear components in nuclear weapons wear out and have to be replaced, during the lifetime of that weapon. Thus, there is an important continuing role for the DOE production plants in maintaining the enduring stockpile. The Armed Services Committee received credible testimony that the President's budget request was inadequate to do so. The budget request, for example, would result in a budget shortfall for one plant alone, the Kansas City plant, of nearly $56 million--$30 million for production operations and $26 million for capital equipment and infrastructure requirements. The president of the division of Allied Signal who is responsible for the Kansas City plant had this to say before the Armed Service Committee, in regard to the President's budget: 
In my view, diminishing support for the production plants would be extremely shortsighted and dangerous for the complex. For plants to be effective members of the team, we must have current and future capabilities to participate fully . . . [Implementation of the programmatic environmental impact statement for stockpile stewardship and management] will require future funding to downsize the plants physically, funding to recapitalize the plants so they are able to function properly once they are fully downsized, and adequate short-term funding to carry out production missions for current requirements. 
I believe that the additional funding in this bill is necessary and appropriate, and I can assure the Senator from Arkansas that as we go to conference on both this bill and the Defense authorization bill, we will arrive at final totals for funds authorized and appropriated that will result in the best possible, and most cost-effective program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the stockpile.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first just clarify what we are about here. The amendment that Senator Dorgan and Senator Moseley-Braun and I have offered is not an amendment to cut out the funding that the administration has requested in this area. It is to support the funding that the administration is requesting in this area. The administration in its budget said that it wanted $28.8 million in the space-based laser program this year, and that is exactly what we are proposing. 
Now, at the committee level and the subcommittee level an additional $118 million, or essentially five times as much funding, was added to the request of the administration. What we are trying to do is say let us go with what the Pentagon requested. That is not an unreasonable position. 
Last evening, Senator Lott spoke in opposition to our amendment, and he said clearly in his view the space-based laser was, and I think this is an exact quote, `the national missile defense option of choice.' 
That is just flat wrong. The Pentagon has made it very clear that their option of choice is the ground-based interceptor which we are funding through the National Missile 
Defense Program in this budget. In fact, we are funding it at twice the level that the administration had earlier requested. Instead of the plan of spending $2.3 billion over the next 5 years, we are going to spend $4.6 billion on that. 
I support that, and our amendment does nothing to interfere with that. So the option of choice is the ground-based program which we have already agreed to go ahead and fund. 
The real question here is where is the money coming from? If we are going to do this space-based laser, where is the money coming from? We would think it totally irresponsible for the administration to come in with this kind of request in 1998 if they could not tell us what they were going to do in future years to follow on in building this so-called demonstrator. But we think nothing of just adding it ourselves and saying, well, we will worry later about how we are going to fund this thing. So that is the issue.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of Senator Domenici's amendment to establish a framework for a final settlement of the assistance payments to the county of Los Alamos under the Atomic Energy Community Act of 1955. As Senator Domenici has pointed out, the Congress has already implemented the first part of a two-step process to end these payments and to provide the County with the ability to develop a commercial tax base--last year the Congress appropriated $22.6 million buyout payment for the county. This amendment implements the second part of the agreement, by transferring excess land from Los Alamos National Laboratory to the county for purposes of economic development. This development will mean jobs for northern New Mexicans and improved economic self-sufficiency for the County. 
In crafting the language being offered today, Senator Domenici and I have worked to address the concerns of a number of parties in New Mexico who have expressed interest in any land transfer involving the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
The language will ensure that land needed for national security purposes will be retained by the Department. 
The language ensures that an environmental review of any transfer will take place, and that land in need of environmental remediation prior to transfer is cleaned up. 
The San Ildefonso Pueblo, which was originally supposed to receive lands that subsequently were withdrawn for the use of the Department of Energy, will participate in the process and have some of these lands returned, including sites that are sacred to the Pueblo. 
Finally, the language addresses the interests of the Homesteaders Association of the Los Alamos Plateau, which represents former owners and descendants of former owners of land that was condemned by the Federal Government for the Manhattan Project. The homesteaders are now researching their claims to the land that was condemned in the 1940's, and have asked for assistance from the Department of Energy in documenting their case. The language that we are considering today requires the Department of Energy to take several actions with respect to these claims. 
First, after the list of parcels of lands that are to be considered for transfer is drawn up, the Department is to submit a report to Congress with the result of a title search on those parcels. 
Second, the Department is also required to provide Congress with an analysis of any claims of former owners, or their heirs and assigns, to such parcels. 
Third, during the year after passage of this act, the Secretary shall engage in concerted efforts to provide claimants with every reasonable opportunity to legally substantiate their claims. The Department, in the past, has provided assistance to other groups and communities to enable them to fully exercise their rights to participate in departmental decisions affecting their vital interests. It is our intention that, within the bounds of reasonableness and appropriateness, the Department provide assistance to the homesteaders, as well. 
Finally, the language states, in two places, that the Department is only to transfer land to which the Government has clear title. If a former owner has a valid legal claim to a parcel, this land transfer amendment provides the Department with no new authority to extinguish that claim. In such a case, the Department must report back to Congress on the claim and remove the affected parcel from consideration for transfer under this section, unless the Department and the former owner or the descendants of the former owner arrive at a mutually agreeable settlement of the claim. 
I believe that this amendment strikes the appropriate balance between the interests of Los Alamos County and the San Ildefonso Pueblo in having access to lands that are no longer needed by the Department and that are not in dispute, and the interests of the former owners of lands on the Los Alamos plateau in having their legal claims fairly examined and respected. I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, section 3161(c) of the fiscal year 1996 National Defense Authorization Act called for the Department of Energy to examine the need for continued funding of the Los Alamos School District and to make recommendations to the Congress. If the Department's recommendation indicates a need for further assistance for the school board or the county, as the case may be, after June 30, 1997, the recommendation shall include a report and plan describing the actions needed to eliminate the need for further assistance for the school board or the county, including a proposal for legislative action to carry out the plan. 
The amendment that I am offering today, with my colleague the senior Senator from New Mexico, is the result of this planning process, involving the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Department of Energy, and the Los Alamos school board, and takes a major step toward downsizing the Department's contribution to the Los Alamos School District. 
The amendment provides for a Federal payment in fiscal year 1998 of $5 million to a foundation that will support educational excellence in the schools serving the children of Los Alamos employees. This Federal payment will be matched by a contribution by the University of California--out of its contract fee for managing and operating Los Alamos National Laboratory--and by private fundraising in the State. The amendment further provides that the interest earned on any Federal payment will remain with the foundation, instead of reverting to the U.S. Treasury, as would be the case absent a special provision to the contrary. In our discussions with the majority members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on this amendment, we have agreed that future payments to the foundation from the Department will be in order, so that the corpus of the endowment is sufficient to sustain excellence in the school system, but that more analysis is required to arrive at an overall figure for such additional support. This is the first step toward bringing to a close the annual payment to the school district. 
It is important to recognize that the Los Alamos School District is subject to a number of special conditions that makes the development of alternative funding sources difficult. 
The State of New Mexico funds its public schools under an equalization formula. Thus, the Los Alamos School District is not funded from local property taxes directly, but from a State-wide fund into which all such property taxes go. This factor represents an important constraint on the ability of the community to tax itself to enhance its school system. As part of the agreement that resulted in this legislative proposal, the school board has agreed to seek special legislation in New Mexico that would allow it to raise revenues to supplement the State-mediated funding. 
Because of its geographic isolation and lack of developable land, Los Alamos is one of the highest-cost-of-living communities in New Mexico, with a cost of living 40 percent higher than the State average and 23 percent higher than the average for all of the United States. Thus, even though Los Alamos receives the same State funding as other comparably sized school districts, in Los Alamos the dollars do not go as far. 
Setting up an educational foundation to help shoulder the burden that the Department has been carrying makes good sense. Further, the Los Alamos School District has committed to a number of actions that will further decrease the need for Department of Energy support in the future. It will increase fees to students for various activities, implement energy efficiency measures, and reduce administrative costs. Already, this year the Los Alamos School District has reduced its spending by roughly $900,00 through such measures, and it will continue to examine contracts and functions in the future in order to reduce costs. 
The Department of Energy and the Congress have always recognized that the quality of the local school system is a significant factor is many relocation decisions involving personnel whom Los Alamos National Laboratory would like to attract and retain. The national interest in maintaining the strength of the laboratory translates into a need to have a mechanism that will produce a superior school system in the communities which are home to the technical employees of the laboratory. This proposal is a major step toward doing that at reduced cost to the Government, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I understand we are going to have some votes at 6 o'clock. So I will take a few minutes here to explain the amendment that I am offering. Senator Dorgan also wishes to speak in favor of the amendment. I believe the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, wishes to speak in opposition to it and maybe some others on both sides. 
Let me start by describing what the issue is. The administration has requested $29 million in this next fiscal year for the space-based laser program which is operated under the Ballistic Missile Defense Office. This is the same funding request level as we have had for the past 2 years. It is the same level that is planned for each of the next several years. This essentially is money to continue the research and development part of this program, which the administration supports, which I support. But the bill which has come to the Senate floor, which the committee has passed out, adds an additional $118 million in this next fiscal year for a total of about $148 million. The amendment that we are offering here will bring the funding level back to what the administration requested. That is $29 million. It shifts the $118 million that the committee added to this space-based laser program to increase the flying hours for the Air Force and the Navy both, $59 million for the Air Force and $59 million for the Navy. 
Mr. President, with that short description, let me send this amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, the bill that we have before us adds $118 million to what is called the space-based laser readiness demonstrator program. That funding level represents 5 years' worth of the planned space-based laser funding--planned by the Pentagon. In order to sustain the program at this increased level, which the committee has reported here, would require an additional expenditure of somewhere between $200 million and $300 million a year, which is more than 10 times what is planned for future budgets. 
Mr. President, let me try to demonstrate the difference that I am talking about with this chart. 
This chart tries to lay out between now and the year 2005 the current rate--which is in green here on this chart--the current rate of funding, cumulative funding, that is requested for this space-based laser activity by the Pentagon, and the yellow in this chart is what the committee would propose to begin adding. 
Now, we do not do all of that. This is a 1-year defense authorization bill. We just add $118 million to the $29 million that the Pentagon requested the first year. But if you take the best figures that have been given us and say we are going to have an additional $200 million a year added, so you put the cumulative amount there, you can see that the total amount by the year 2005 is a very substantial figure. 
The larger context for considering this space-based laser program involves four basic questions. Let me briefly go through each of those. First of all, what is a space-based laser? People need to understand something about that, and I will try to explain it. Second, how would a space-based laser fit into the U.S. plan for a national missile defense? Third, is there a threat that warrants or justifies developing and deploying a space-based laser? And finally, No. 4, would it be affordable for us to do so? Would it be cost effective for us to do so? 
Let me try to explain first what a space-based laser is and then answer each of these other questions. 
Mr. President, the space-based laser, which is the subject of this amendment, is technology that was born in the early days of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. For those who have followed this set of issues over the last decade or so, they will remember the star wars proposals that we debated on the floor. The crown jewel of that star wars program was the space-based laser. It held out the promise of tens of satellites constantly orbiting the Earth ready to zap the hundreds upon hundreds of Soviet nuclear ballistic missiles that were launched from land and sea both. 
The idea behind the space-based laser is that we would orbit a group of perhaps 20 or perhaps more very large satellites. Each satellite would be in the range of 80,000 pounds and each of them would be equipped with a chemical laser on the satellite. The chemical laser would produce a beam of very high-energy laser light that would then be focused very carefully with a very huge mirror so that the laser beam could be focused on missiles when they were first launched. That was the idea of getting up in space, so that you could zap a missile when they first launched it. You didn't have to wait until the missile actually came near your territory. 
This would require having equipment on the satellite capable of detecting and tracking and pointing the laser at a relatively small object some 1,300 kilometers away over a long enough period of time to permit the laser energy to destroy the missile. 
The satellites are so large, the satellites contemplated in this program of space-based lasers are so large and so heavy, we would have to design and build an entire new series of heavy space-launch vehicles with enough lifting power to get one of these huge payloads, 40 tons, into space--80,000 pounds, 40 tons. There is today no rocket, there is no space-launch vehicle currently in our inventory that can boost such a large payload into space. 
The cost of building such a booster would represent a significant part of the cost of any space-based laser system. The space-based laser readiness demonstrator which we would fund or begin to fund with the $118 million provided in the bill is meant to demonstrate that the many technologies that are required in order to accomplish what I have just described can be met and overcome. The demonstrator would be a reduced size system with all the necessary technology and parts to make all the components work together at the same time. 
This would presumably cost several billion dollars to find out the answers to these questions. The money does not exist anywhere in the Pentagon's budget plan for this coming year or the next 5 years, or the out years even after that. So, clearly that money would have to come from other defense programs. 
I should point out that this chart, which takes us through the year 2005, does not get us to actual deployment, or development even of a space-based laser. This only gets us to the development of this demonstrator, which I think, as I indicated, is a half-size replica of what we would actually be talking about developing at some future date. 
The second question I mentioned, which needs to be dealt with, is, how does this space-based laser fit into our National Missile Defense Program? The United States is developing a National Missile Defense System to defend against a small Third World nation ICBM program, an intercontinental ballistic missile program that has not emerged yet and is not, in fact, expected to emerge for another 15 years. But we are developing that program. The National Missile Defense Program is designed to be compliant with the ABM Treaty, although it remains to be seen whether we might need to change or propose changes or withdraw from that treaty at some time in the future. 
There is no U.S. plan to deploy a space-based laser system, and we know of no justification today for doing so. That is why the Pentagon has asked merely to continue with research and development funding in this area. 
Furthermore, the cost of deploying such a system would be enormous. The existing National Missile Defense System Program involves developing a ground-based missile interceptor capability which is very different from a space-based laser. The ground-based defense system just had its development cost increased from $2.3 to $4.6 billion. The administration requested that increase. 
Our committee is proposing that the Senate go along with that increase. We are adding $474 million to this year's defense bill in order to do that, and nothing in our amendment that I am talking about here would affect that at all. But the cost to deploy the National Missile Defense System last year was pegged at about $10 billion. When you add to that the space and missile tracking system, you get another $5-or-so billion. So we are already planning on paying something in the order of $17 billion for the limited National Missile Defense System that is designed to stop a handful of rogue missiles coming into this country. As I said before, we have no plan, however, to pay the additional tens of billions of dollars to actually develop and deploy a space-based laser. 
The third question that I cited when I began my comments is, is there a threat that this country faces to our national security, a threat that would justify developing and deploying the space-based laser? The National Missile Defense System that we are developing today that I just described is meant to defend against a handful of these ICBM's that might be launched at some future date by some rogue nation, if they develop the capability to do that. According to the administration, there is no significant ballistic missile threat being faced by the United States today. 
North Korea is the only nation considered to be actively trying to develop such a missile. But the North Korean economy is in terrible shape. Their own military, according to the best information we have, is going hungry in some cases. The Defense Intelligence Agency publicly stated that their country is--I believe they used the phrase `probably terminal.' Neither Russian nor Chinese strategic missiles are considered a threat today because neither nation has a plausible reason to attack the United States. And, of course, we maintain an overwhelming nuclear deterrent capability, which we should maintain. 
The United States and Russia have detargeted their ICBM's and their SLBM's, which means that no accidental launch could be expected from either territory toward the other country. So this is not a threat situation that requires a space-based laser. This is not a threat situation that requires rapid and expensive development of this so-called readiness demonstrator, as this accelerated program is referred to. 
The final issue I wanted to mention is the issue of cost. Is the space-based laser either affordable or cost effective? Last year's Defend America Act, as proposed but not as enacted, included a requirement for space-based lasers. That was a primary factor that led the Congressional Budget Office to estimate the cost of the system at up to $60 billion to procure and up to an additional $120 billion to operate it over the next 30 years. 
The Department of Defense stated recently that CBO's cost estimates may have been too low and that the cost of building and launching a space-based laser system is almost certainly higher than those figures. One reason for the high cost, as I mentioned in describing a space-based laser, is the cost of launching the heavy laser systems into space. We need a heavy-lift booster that does not exist today. It would be very expensive to develop. The cost of such a system is totally outside the realm of the current budget or the planned defense budgets. This would not be affordable, and it is not likely that it is cost effective against the limited emerging ballistic missile threat. The current program is designed to handle any foreseeable limited ballistic missile attack from a rogue nation. 
The Department of Defense has recently doubled the cost estimate for the development program, as I mentioned, and there is no plan to deploy even that ground-based missile interceptor system today unless and until a real threat emerges. If such a deployment is warranted, obviously we will have to spend substantially more. But none of the deployment funds are planned in any future defense budget even for the ground-based missile defense system, the missile interceptor system that I described. 
DOD has no plans to fund the space-based laser program at the much higher levels that are proposed in this defense bill. DOD clearly has higher priorities. We need to protect those higher priorities and not pass a bill here which commits us or which starts us down the road toward spending money on programs that the Department of Defense has not requested. 
The bottom line is that we are nowhere near deploying a space-based laser. There is no need for us to do so. The administration already has a very expensive National Missile Defense Development Program underway. And unless this amendment that we are offering here this evening is adopted, the Senate will be putting five times as much money into the space-based laser program as the administration has requested in 1998, and we will be starting down the road to developing a demonstrator and eventually a space-based laser program that will be hugely expensive and of very marginal value to our national security. 
So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. At this point, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, if there is nobody else wishing to speak at this point.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just add a couple of items that I overlooked, since we have just another couple of minutes here before the vote occurs. 
As I indicated in describing the amendment, we are suggesting that the $118 million which we are trying to delete from the bill for the space-based laser program be, instead, transferred over for Air Force and Navy flying hours. The reason I have offered that suggestion is a letter from the Secretary of Defense to Senator Levin, and I am sure Senator Thurmond also received a copy of it. The letter is dated the 23d of May. Former Senator Cohen, now Secretary Cohen, stated in this letter: 
In addition to adjustments reflective of the Quadrennial Defense Review, I recommend a fact-of-life adjustment concerning flying hour costs. The Navy and the Air Force are both experiencing greater costs per flying hour than anticipated in their budgets. We are currently analyzing the causes of this increase, but the preliminary indications are that the increase is caused by greater spare parts requirements per flying hour than were experienced in the past. We estimate the impact of these increases to be $350 million for the Navy and $200 million for the Air Force. 
So he has requested that we add the total of $550 million to the combined flying hours for the Air Force and the Navy. This amendment adds $59 million to the Air Force and $59 million to the Navy. Obviously, it does not meet the entire requirement as stated by the Secretary of Defense, but it moves us in the right direction. 
So I do think this is a better use of the funds. It is a use that the Pentagon itself and the Secretary of Defense have indicated they support. For that reason, that is what we are suggesting be done with the funds. 
Mr. President, let me also, before I yield the floor again, ask unanimous consent that Senator Dorgan be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes the Secretary of Energy to ensure full participation of the Department of Energy in the very successful Hispanic Outreach Program that that department has had. 
In September 1995, the Secretary of Energy announced a strategic plan to address the needs, talents and capabilities of the nation's Hispanic community. 
This strategic plan calls for the Department to take effective steps to further the participation of DOE in educational programs, particularly in the fields of science and technology that serve Hispanic students. 
In fiscal year 1996 the DOE set a goal of $20 million for funding Hispanic Service Educational Institutions and Initiatives. This level of investment provides significant dividends to the Hispanic community as well as to the Department of Energy. 
Other programs are included within the Hispanic Outreach Initiative to encourage improved investment, training, and placement for Hispanic population in business using the internet and the Hispanic Radio Network. 
As a result of such initiatives, Hispanic employment at the Department of Energy has increased at all grade levels during the past four years. 
The amendment I am offering today directs the Secretary of Energy to ensure that all components of the Department participate fully in this initiative in order to achieve the widest possible impact. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment as an effective means to benefit the taxpayer and improve opportunities for the Hispanic community. 
I believe we can take action on the amendment at this point. I know of no Senator that wishes to speak in opposition.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since there is no other Senator wishing to speak right now, let me say a word about the procedure that we seem to be agreed upon of having a cloture vote this afternoon at 3 o'clock. I know the majority leader has requested unanimous consent to do that and has been granted unanimous consent to do that. I certainly did not object. But I have to say, Mr. President, that the procedures in the Senate, as is said in Alice in Wonderland, get curiouser and curiouser. Having a cloture vote at this stage in our deliberations on this Defense authorization bill seems to me the most curious of any procedure I can recall. 
We are, as I understand it, being advised by the leadership, the majority leadership, Senator Lott, that we do not want any votes on this bill until at least 6 o'clock tomorrow evening when the absent Members who are in Madrid with the President attending the meeting on NATO return. I understand that is a very important meeting, and I certainly commend them for being there to attend 
that. I do not object to postponing votes on this important defense authorization bill until they return. 
But for us to be, on one hand, being told that we should not vote because Members are absent and, on the other hand, being told that we should invoke cloture because someone is delaying the Senate in concluding action on this bill, the only people delaying the Senate in concluding action are the absent Senators or the leadership in trying to protect them from votes. So I have great difficulty understanding why we are having this cloture vote today. 
Obviously, if that is the majority leader's will or desire, he has that right under Senate rules. But for people who try to understand the proceedings around the Senate, I think they need to understand that invoking cloture does cut off debate. That is the purpose of it. It limits the number of amendments each Senator can offer. It limits the length of time each Senator can speak. It prevents us from seriously considering legitimate proposals that may be made to improve or alter this bill. 
So I think it would be a big mistake for us to invoke cloture. As I said in my early comment, I think it is really very confusing to this Senator to understand why we are having the vote at all. I hope that the majority leader will reconsider and vitiate the yeas and nays and put off any votes on cloture until such time as there is some evidence at least that some Senator is trying to delay action on the bill. I see no evidence of that at the present time. I think all of the Senators who have come to the floor this morning to offer amendments have had those amendments set aside because of their agreement with the majority leader's position that we should postpone votes until tomorrow evening after our colleagues return from Madrid. 
Mr. President, I wanted to make that statement because I have great difficulty understanding myself the procedure that is being followed. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly in support of this amendment that Senator Lugar has offered and commend him for his leadership on this very important issue. Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn established this program, promoted this program, and have led the Senate in gaining support for this program over these last several years. I see it as one of the few shining examples that we can point to to indicate that we are aware of the new reality, the new post-cold-war reality that we face with Russia and with other former Soviet Union countries. 
Let me briefly describe, as Senator Lugar has and Senator Levin has, what the amendment does. It would add or restore to the bill before us amounts that were cut at the subcommittee level to get it back to the level of funding that the administration requested in three different areas. One is what is referred to as MPC&A funds--that stands for materials 
protection control and accounting funds--for the Department of Energy. The second is $50 million being restored for the International Nuclear Safety Program, again, in the Department of Energy. And the third item is $60 million that is being restored in the cooperative threat reduction programs which are operated and administered by the Department of Defense. 
Mr. President, the legislative provisions that accompany this provide greater flexibility in administering the CTR Program. They allow fiscal year 1997 funds for international border security to be available for obligation for 3 years and allow the Customs Service to use fiscal year 1997 funds that were provided to purchase new equipment to also be used to provide assistance to employees to allow that new equipment to be fully integrated into the operations of the Customs Service. 
This amendment and the funds that these programs contain are intended to reduce the danger of so-called loose nukes, or nuclear weapons that might fall into the hands of terrorists, might fall into the hands of people not authorized to have those weapons; also, to help reduce the danger that fissile material, material that is essential to making of new nuclear weapons, not fall into those same hands. The funds are intended to help destroy ICBM silos and launchers in the former Soviet Union and to generally help reduce the risk in the near term from the operation of Soviet-designed nuclear powerplants. 
Mr. President, the arguments have been well laid out by Senator Lugar and Senator Levin, as well. This is a program that has accomplished a tremendous amount already in reducing the risk of nuclear weapons. 
I had the good fortune earlier this year, about 2 months ago, to travel to Russia and to visit some of the facilities that we are spending funds at to work on these cooperative programs with the Russians. I traveled there with Mr. Paul Robinson, who is head of Sandia National Laboratory, and with others who work with him at Sandia National Laboratory on these cooperative threat reduction programs and Department of Energy programs. I also traveled there with others from the Department of Energy Los Alamos National Laboratory. The general impression I received in visiting Chelyabinsk-70, which is one of the closed cities that the Russians established in order to develop and promote their nuclear weapons activity, the general impression was that these funds are being extremely well used and are, in fact, increasing the security that surrounds fissile materials and other materials that could be used in connection with nuclear weapons. 
We met with Minister Mikhaylov who is head of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, MINATOM, and, again, I was impressed with the willingness to continue the cooperation to work with our own Department of Energy in making progress on these programs. 
We met with admirals from the Russian Navy. They have a very significant problem of fresh uranium that can be used as fuel in their nuclear reactors, how to secure that, how to protect it from possible seizure by terrorists. They clearly wanted our help. They are obtaining our help. They need substantially more help in the years ahead. I felt good about the level of cooperation that is occurring there. 
My general conclusion from the trip was the same as the one stated by Senator Lugar in his statement earlier, and that is that there is a long list of useful projects that funds in these programs can be put to. We are not short of useful activities to work on. The contrary is the case. There are a great many things that the Russians need to do to protect and to reduce the risk of theft of nuclear materials. We are just now beginning to make serious progress on that. The funds that will be restored by this amendment are essential to making that progress. I very much believe that when you look at the entire U.S. defense budget and say, which of the funds are the most cost-effective, where are we getting the most national security return for the dollars spent, the funds being spent in these programs are clearly very high on that list. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I hope that we can get a unanimous vote. This is a program that needs bipartisan support. This is not a program that should become the subject of partisan dispute in the U.S. Senate. It is too important to our safety and to our future and to the future of the world for us to find ourselves in some kind of partisan dispute over funds like this or programs like these.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 6 years ago, the Congress voted to take some dramatic steps to reduce the threat of nuclear terrorism when it approved the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--CTR. Since that time, as a result of work being done by CTR programs, over 1,400 nuclear warheads that were aimed at the United States or our allies have been removed; 64 submarine ballistic missile launchers have been eliminated; 54 intercontinental ballistic missile silos, 61 SS-18 ICBM's, and 23 strategic bombers have been eliminated. Today, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan no longer have any nuclear weapons with which to threaten the United States or our allies. 
Support for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has run high and enjoys bipartisan support. Last year in the Senate, in a 96-to-0 vote, we enacted the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction. This program and its companion programs in the Department of Energy have repeatedly withstood attempts to undo the progress that has been made in reducing the threat of nuclear terror. Legislators from both sides of the aisle are able to see the important benefits to the United States, and to understand the need to move beyond cold war attitudes that prevent us from meeting today's national security needs to prevent nuclear terrorism. 
This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted along partisan lines to cut $135 million from the CTR Program, the Materials Protection Control and Accounting Program, and the International Nuclear Safety Program. The benefits gained from those programs are so important that I must appeal to my colleagues on the floor of the Senate to restore those funds so we can continue the valuable work being done to minimize the possibility that some person or some rogue country could threaten the United States or any other nation with nuclear weapons. 
I've already mentioned some of the benefits gained through the CTR Program. Much more work remains to be done to dismantle Russian missile launchers, silos, and aircraft. I urge my colleagues to continue to support this program which reduces the threat to the United States in such a direct manner. The $60 million cut by partisan vote in the committee should be restored in order to continue work that is essential to our national security interests. 
The Materials Protection Control and Accounting--MPC&A--Program in the Department of Energy--DOE--is intended to prevent theft of smuggling of nuclear materials that could be used in nuclear weapons or for other forms of terrorism. DOE has put security equipment in place at 18 sites to safeguard those nuclear materials, and agreements are in place to expand security procedures and equipment at 30 additional sites. I recently observed the work being done by this program first hand during a visit to Russia's nuclear research facilities. I felt relieved to know that the Russians are now better able to control and monitor their own nuclear materials than ever before. I am also aware, however, that the Russians have hundreds of nuclear sites needing additional security measures to prevent theft and unauthorized use. A great deal of work needs to be done, and it is important that the Congress continue to fully fund the MPC&A Program in our own national security interest. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to support our amendment to restore $25 million to the MPC&A Program so that this valuable work can continue without pause. 
The committee also voted on partisan lines to cut all of the funding requested for the International Nuclear Safety Program--INSP. This program began in the wake of international concerns over the damage done by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster. The Russians continue to operate reactors that are similar in design to the one at Chernobyl, and that pose a similar risk of a catastrophic accident. The INSP Program, managed by the Department of Energy, is designed to reduce those risks for Russia's older reactors and to help Russia and Newly Independent States to establish self-sustaining nuclear safety programs that enable them to reach international nuclear reactor safety standards. It is in our national and international interest to do what we can to ensure that those reactors are safe. I urge my colleagues to vote to restore this important program. 
As I suggested earlier, the Congress has repeatedly demonstrated its conviction that CTR, MPC&A, INSP, and related programs serve our national security interests. To those who say these programs are a form of foreign aid to the Russians, I concur that ultimately the Russians must assume full responsibility for these programs. Until they are financially and technologically capable of doing so, it is essential to our own interests that we assist them in putting effective security programs into place. We know how expensive it is to support the strategic offensive and defensive weapons systems designed to ensure our security against nuclear weapons. We also know how dangerous and vulnerable this country could be to nuclear terrorism which, in some cases, we may not be able to effectively protect ourselves from. For those modest expenditures for CTR, MPC&A, and INSP, we buy ourselves a significant measure of security worth many times the funds invested. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to continue their bipartisan support for these programs and vote to restore their funding. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<DOCNO>105-bingaman-nm-2-19970627</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is being offered on behalf of myself and Senator Conrad. 
Mr. President, we all understand what regular IRA's are about and how those work where a person can put up to $2,000 into an IRA. It accumulates earnings over a career, and then when you retire you go ahead and pay tax on it. 
What we have in this bill is something different than a regular IRA. We have an IRA Plus. The IRA Plus differs in a very important way. What this chart shows is it essentially says if you agree to pay the tax that is due on your existing IRA up through the end of next year, the 1st of January 1998, it will give you the time that this budget agreement covers to pay all of that tax in. And then the earnings from that money in that IRA Plus account are never going to be taxed the rest of your life. 
That is what the provision is. It is a back-loaded IRA which means it is specifically for people who are not eligible for the other types of IRA's. So if you have over $100,000 and you already have a retirement account, then you can have an IRA Plus. The earnings from the funds in that IRA Plus will never be taxed. 
I urge the Senate to adopt our amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the tax bill we are debating, S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. This bill is not the bill I would have preferred if I had written all of the details, but it has many redeeming sections which I think do benefit New Mexico and the Nation as a whole. 
I want very much for New Mexicans to get needed tax relief. We have a strong economy and are within reach of a balanced budget. It does seem to me that the tax burden of many New Mexicans and others is higher than it needs to be--and while this is not structured the way I would have preferred it--I will support final passage of S. 949 because it does move us further in a positive direction, than it does negative. This bill expands IRA's in a way in which nearly 90 percent of our working population will be eligible for these accounts, in contrast to just 70 percent today. Also, this bill provides both capital gains and estate tax relief, phased in in incremental steps, but nonetheless important to the overall investment climate of the Nation. I hope that a great portion of that investment and economic activity gets directed toward and takes place in New Mexico. 
This bill contains about $32 billion in education provisions which will be of benefit to many New Mexicans, particularly those who need support for college tuition. In addition, over 45 percent of New Mexico's families paying taxes of $1,500 or more will be eligible to take advantage of the HOPE scholarship. And while I would have preferred that this figure be far higher, approximately 51 percent of dependent children in New Mexico will be eligible for some portion of the per child tax credit. Another important accomplishment in this bill is that it provides resources to help cover child health insurance for the 10.5 million uninsured kids in America by raising the tobacco tax by 20 cents per pack. 
There are other provisions in S. 949 that are worthy of support including permanent extension of the tax credit for employer provided educational assistance which many New Mexican workers and firms have very much wanted. This bill also provides for an exemption from the 2 percent miscellaneous work provision of the Tax Code for hard-working, dedicated teachers who spend their own money on education technology materials and who should be able to fully expense these costs on their tax returns. 
However, this bill is far from perfect. S. 949, which provides for an $85 billion net tax decrease, does not provide for the kind of distribution of benefits across our society that I would have preferred. Although the Finance Committee did a far better job of making the tax cuts fairer than did the House Ways and Means Committee, I would have preferred the Democratic alternative which was offered yesterday by Senator Daschle. 
The bill we are passing today--and which I plan to support on final passage--still hands the lion's share of tax relief to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans, more than the combined lower 60 percent will receive. By contrast, if we had passed the Daschle bill, working families would have received almost twice the tax relief provided in the Finance Committee plan. 
Furthermore, the Democratic proposal had many targeted tax relief measures which would have done much more for small businesses and small farms than the Republican bill achieves. In education, the Democratic amendment would have provided working families more opportunities to help educate their children, rebuild schools and send their children to college. 
Perhaps most importantly, the Democratic bill was the more fiscally responsible of the two alternatives. One of my major concerns about S. 949 is that the backloading of estate tax provisions, capital gains provisions, and particularly IRA provisions will balloon the budget deficit enormously just after we finally achieve the discipline to bring the Nation's spending and income into balance. 
Let me explain a bit about my concern about the IRA provisions. I completely support the notion that the Nation needs more savings. This will help generate more capital for long-term investment and growth. But I object to allowing only the wealthiest in our society to have the tax incentives and tax havens to save. We should provide incentives across the board--and make sure that all sectors of our society are getting some degree of retirement savings in place. This bill does not do this. In fact, this legislation is a radical departure from our current retirement savings policy which at least purports to establish a level playing field for both high income and low income workers. 
Unfortunately, the Finance Committee tax proposal contains two IRA provisions which are at fundamental odds with each other and represent the Cain and Abel of retirement savings policy. On one hand, the bill makes an important contribution to strengthening the national savings system by doubling the income eligibility for deductible IRA's. The proposal makes deductible IRA eligibility available for 90 percent of the population instead of the 70 percent now eligible. 
Under this better side of the S. 949, deductible IRA's will be available to everyone with less than $100,000, joint filers, of income. And as is the case with current law, even those with incomes above $100,000 can still make deductible IRA contributions, as long as they have no other employer-sponsored pension plan. 
It is also important to understand that under current law, people who have employer-sponsored retirement plans can still make 
nondeductible contributions to IRA accounts. These people can put an extra $2,000 a year away so that this money can accrue and compound tax-free until retirement. This tax-advantaged savings opportunity provides significant benefits to those who make after tax IRA contributions. So far so good. 
But Senator Roth's IRA Plus proposal, in contrast to the IRA expansion provisions, is a bad step for us to take. A radical departure from past retirement savings policy, IRA Plus overwhelmingly benefits the rich. It also creates a slippery slope towards tax-free havens for other retirement programs and blows a very large hole in the Federal budget deficit in future years. The fact is that because tax advantages in the other Roth provisions are available to both those under $100,000 income levels as well as those at any income level who don't have an employer-sponsored pension plan, only those above $100,000 income levels and who actually have employer-sponsored plans benefit from IRA Plus. 
Because all distributions from these IRA Plus accounts are tax free, they provide a certain group of wealthy savers a home grown version of a Swiss bank tax haven. If these IRA Plus accounts are established, there is no doubt that they will be a terrific deal for those who participate. But it's not fair and not good policy to provide a tax windfall to the rich and do nothing for those who are struggling to save smaller sums; those less wealthy taxpayers will continue to pay tax on any distributions. 
Furthermore, IRA Plus accounts create a troublesome benchmark vis a vis other savings vehicles. It is reasonable to ask that if IRA Plus accounts are tax free, then why not 401(k)'s or regular IRA's or the Simple Plan or corporate defined benefit programs? It would be terrific if all savings vehicles were tax free, but the fact is that the IRA Plus program alone--given the tremendous backloading in it--will blow a huge hole in the budget deficit in future years. 
While the IRA provisions in the Finance Committee tax bill start out costing just $3.3 billion in the first five years, the cost surges to $20.5 billion in the next five years and then to an estimated $88.5 billion in the following ten years. Most of this backloading comes from the establishment of IRA Plus accounts. Furthermore, the irreversibility of this backloading will tie the Nation's hands just as the crush of retiring baby boomers forces very real costs on the Federal Government. 
We should think very carefully about the consequences of setting up these IRA Plus accounts. I very much hope that when this bill goes to conference, the conferees will tread carefully and will reconsider this very troublesome provision. 
I have other concerns including the signals that I think are being 
sent to hard-working New Mexican families that you have to have a high level of income and children to fully qualify for the child tax credit we are providing in this bill; 70 percent of New Mexico tax filers report less than $30,000 in annual income, 45 percent have less than $15,000 income. It is obvious that many, many New Mexico children will not be able to benefit significantly from the child tax credit. 
Many here attempted to offer amendments which I supported and which would have made the $500 per child tax credit refundable against payroll taxes; or in a different approach, would have allowed tax filers to get their full EITC credit and then figure the per child credit. Either of these would have ensured that millions more children around the Nation and more than 250,000 New Mexico children would have benefited from this provision. 
Overall, S. 949 delivers a better package of education, health, and child care spending initiatives and various tax relief provisions than the House bill. I wish we had done better and hope that the conferees will struggle to produce an even better bill than this, rather than dumbing this down to many of the worst provisions in the House companion bill. I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to change the subject just slightly in this debate and talk about a different aspect of why I believe the Democratic alternative being proposed here is preferable to the bill which was reported by the Finance Committee. That is because, as I see it, the Finance Committee bill has in it what have been referred to as fiscal `time 
bombs,' which would explode the size of the revenue loss as we move into the next century. 
Our bill, our alternative, the Democratic alternative, tries to eliminate those fiscal time bombs, and in doing so is more fiscally responsible for the long-term future of the country. 
Let me talk about that aspect of it slightly. I do so first with this chart that I have here. This chart shows tax cuts--the Senate bill; this is the bill we are debating and getting ready to vote on here either late tonight or tomorrow--shows that the tax cuts in this Senate bill are heavily backloaded. 
What that means is that, although the budget agreement calls for $85 billion in tax cuts in the next 5 years, through the year 2002, it calls for $250 billion in tax cuts up through the following 5 years, up to 2007, and if you take the next 10 years and look at what happens in that period so that you have the full 20-year period in mind, it goes to $830 billion in tax cuts and lost revenue to the Treasury. That is what we mean by backloaded. 
You say, why are we losing that much revenue? What is there in this tax bill that is costing that much revenue? Here are three of the main reasons why we are losing that revenue. 
Of course, this chart only goes through the year 2007, but it shows that the alternative minimum tax, of course, the change there is losing $15 billion, the change in the capital gains is losing $24 billion in this second 5-year period, and the change in the IRA's is losing $45 billion. 
I want to talk a moment about the provisions in this bill related to IRA's and how we are going about losing that much money. 
We are losing it primarily because of a provision in this bill that is called the IRA Plus--the IRA Plus. People need to understand a little bit about the IRA Plus. 
Mr. President, there are two kinds of IRA's that are available to any of us today in America. One is a deductible IRA where you are able to deposit into your individual retirement account money before you pay tax on it. That is deductible money, deductible from your tax return. 
The other, of course, is a nondeductible IRA. You can deposit up to $2,000. If you do not use the deductible IRA, you can deposit up to $2,000 in a nondeductible IRA. That is money that you have already paid tax on. 
You can have either under current law. 
Let me just talk a moment about the deductible IRA. Under current law, all taxpayers with incomes below $50,000--that is joint filers--so a family that earns less than $50,000 or reports income of $50,000 may make a deductible contribution to an IRA. They can put up to $2,000 in an IRA every year without paying tax on that money. That can be saved by them for their retirement into the future. They do not have to take it out, do not have to begin taking it out until they are over 70 years old. That is a very good benefit. 
All ratepayers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored plan may make deductible contributions regardless of their income level. So we are saying that if you are not covered by any kind of employer-sponsored plan, you can go ahead and deposit your $2,000, take the tax deduction under current law, and you are not penalized. This covers over 70 percent of all of those who are eligible, so that 70 percent of the people filing tax returns today can take this $2,000 deductible contribution if they so choose. 
Under the proposals in this bill on deductible IRA's, all taxpayers then with incomes below $100,000--we are essentially doubling or increasing by twice the income level for joint filers--and any family with an income up to $100,000 can make a deductible contribution to an IRA. All taxpayers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored plan may make deductible contributions regardless of the income level. 
The estimate here is that we are now talking, under the proposed bill, of 90 percent of all taxpayers, 90 percent of all families will be eligible to make deductible contributions. 
We are going next, Mr. President, to the real clincher in this so-called IRA Plus. 
An IRA Plus is a nondeductible IRA. It is not a deductible IRA. It is not the kind of IRA that is available to people who have $100,000 or less in income or who are covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. This is aimed primarily at those who earn over $100,000 in income and who have employer-sponsored retirement plans already. 
Current law says that you can go ahead and deposit your $2,000 each year. That money compounds, that money gains interest or capital gains of whatever kind until such time as you start drawing the money out, at which time you pay tax on it. 
The proposal in here, IRA Plus, says that not only can you have this, you can have it in a particularly attractive way. 
First of all, we are going to let you take any IRA you have now and convert it into an IRA Plus if you want to and pay the tax that is due up to January 1, 1999. You have to pay it during the 5 years that it is covered by this budget plan so we can take full credit of those funds in deciding whether we have balanced the budget, but you can pay that, and then once you have set that up, the nondeductible IRA is no longer taxable. 
There is no tax owed when you realize a gain. There is no tax owed when you distribute money out of that IRA. There is no tax owed when you spend the money. We are setting up essentially, Mr. President, our own version of a Swiss savings account or a Swiss bank account. 
We have all read about people with lots of money who go to Switzerland and set up a bank account so they can avoid taxes that way. They will not have to do that anymore. They can just set up an IRA Plus, put money in there, and then any gain they realize on that for the rest of their life is not taxable. 
This is the only place in our tax law, as far as I know--I am not an expert on tax law--but as far as I know there is no place else in our tax law where we set up this kind of a provision, where we say if you put money in one of these accounts we will no longer charge you any tax on that or on the gains from that money for the rest of your life. This is what the IRA Plus is. This is why this bill is so heavily backloaded. 
Clearly, this is a fiscal time bomb. There is no other way to look at it. There is no justification, in my view, for us putting this kind of a benefit in for individuals who have over $100,000 in income and who are also covered by another employer-sponsored retirement plan. This is a provision which is not, as I understand it, in the House bill that is being considered on the House side. 
I hope very much later in the debate today I can offer an amendment to try to strike this provision from our own bill. If we do strike this provision, we will deal with a great deal of the problem that exists in the Finance Committee bill in the backloading of this provision. It will be much more fiscally responsible to eliminate this provision, and clearly it will be fair to working Americans at all income levels. 
I still want all Americans to have the right to deposit the $2,000 after tax into an IRA, just as they can under present law. That is entirely appropriate. But they ought to have to pay tax on the earnings from that as they do today. 
Mr. President, I hope this amendment is seriously considered when I do get a chance to offer it later in the evening. I also believe that the fact that we are eliminating this IRA Plus in the alternative that the Democrats are offering today is a major reason why I am planning to support that alternative. 
I commend Senator Daschle for putting it forward today, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the problem of retirement security is an ever mounting challenge to the future welfare of our Nation. More than 51 million Americans are not covered by any kind of pension plan. The aging of the baby boom generation will dramatically increase the retired population in proportion to the working population early in the next century. By the year 2029, when the youngest baby boomers reach age 65, more than 68 million persons will be older than 65--accounting for more than 20 percent of the U.S. population, compared to just 12 percent today. 
In my own State of New Mexico just 29 percent of our work force has some kind of pension plan. As this chart shows, New Mexico has the worst ranking in the nation in terms of workers covered by pensions. Just a few states have private sector working populations with over 50 percent covered by pensions. 
Our Nation is facing certain crisis if we fail to take steps to correct this problem of people working until retirement--and finding that their Social Security benefits fail to maintain adequate and acceptable living standards. Despite the proliferation of retirement products in various forms of IRA's and 401(K) plans, patterns clearly show that those who earn enough to save probably do. Our problem is that over the last 18 years, we have had no increase in the percentage of our work force that is participating in a qualified pension program. 
Those who are well off and can look forward to retirement security cannot afford to just abandon those who are not. We have a market failure that we must address, particularly as the Nation's traditional safety net is being rolled back because of budget cuts on so many other fronts. I am not opposed to improving and even expanding the pension plans of those who have them now. My concerns, however, are focused on the reality that we are improving existing pension plans, expanding IRA opportunities and creating new forms of individual retirement accounts, but we are still doing absolutely nothing to get a large portion of our uncovered work force covered by some degree of retirement savings. 
The costs of doing what we need to do will be large. But let's think for a moment about the IRA provisions in the tax bill we are discussing today. The IRA expansion provisions in the Senate version of the bill cost approximately $3.3 billion during the first 5 years and $20.5 billion in the following 5 years. These costs may be appropriate and necessary--but at the same time, we need to confront the revenue impact of covering the parts of our society that currently have no retirement savings at all. I think that it is poor public policy to expand only one-half of the equation like we have been doing. 
Mr. President, in order to ensure that this Congress does face the issue of retirement security for all working Americans and not just the fortunate minority who are saving, I am here to introduce the `Retirement Security for All Americans Pension Pro-Save Act.' 
The bill I am introducing outlines a concept for pension expansion and portability that has been discussed in this Chamber several times over the last several decades but which has not 
evolved until now as legislation. The Pension ProSave System, a clearinghouse for individual pension accounts, would improve the retirement income security of millions of working Americans by encouraging employees to make contributions on their behalf, by facilitating pension portability, by preserving and significantly increasing retirement savings and by simplifying pension law. 
Mr. President, this plan is not aimed at the existing pension and savings structures in this country. This proposal targets those who are working their way towards retirement--and will have little or nothing to supplement their Social Security benefits. Despite 18 years of availability of simplified pension plans, pension coverage remains low in the small business sector. Even when covered by a tax-advantaged pension plan, workers do not always continue to save their pension assets when they can receive them when moving from one place of employment to another. Tax penalties unfortunately have not been very successful in discouraging the spending of these mid-career retirement savings disbursements. Of the $47.9 billion in pre-retirement distributions made in 1990, less than 20% of recipients reported putting the entire distribution into another tax-qualified retirement plan. 
The Pension ProSave Clearinghouse is modeled after the highly successful Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equity Fund [TIAA-CREF], the largest private pension system in the world with assets over $136 billion and about 1.7 million participants at about 5,500 institutions. Not replacing existing pension programs, Pension ProSave is designed to supplement these other programs and will increase pension coverage to millions of Americans. 
The benefits of Pension ProSave are first, that this plan would provide an incentive and a simple, hassle free way for employers to provide portable pension benefits to their workers. Employees could also make matching contributions to their accounts on a 2:1 basis to a maximum of $6,000. The employer's contributions also would not exceed $6,000. Mr. President, I want to emphasize that these are the employee's accounts--not the government's and not the employer's. These accounts will remain with those workers the duration of their lives. 
Second, Pension ProSave would stop the leakage of retirement savings by furnishing employer's pension contributions into a privately managed, pension portability clearinghouse. Worker's account balances would be invested and managed by private sector firms in diversified portfolios. 
Let me explain how Pension ProSave would work. Any employer wishing to take advantage of the Pension ProSave Program would furnish the names of all employees, employed for at least 6 months and over 21 years of age, to the ProSave Portability Clearinghouse established in this Act. The employer will indicate each employee's salary and the uniform percentage of all salaries which the employer will contribute to employee ProSave accounts. The employer will have the option of changing its percentage contribution each year, as long as that 
contribution equals at least 1 percent. This can help business owners--who want to provide pension benefits to their employees--avoid getting locked into a rate that remains fixed while the economic performance of their small businesses may be volatile. 
Once a ProSave account is established for an employee, the employer will forward contributions to the account at the time of each paycheck or at least prior to the end of that year. 
With the agreement of the employee, an employer who has another defined benefit or defined contribution plan for its employees and who does not choose to establish ProSave accounts will still be able to use the portability clearinghouse as a repository for retirement funds of an employee who is leaving its employ. When a worker leaves one job where retirement benefits have accrued, the employee may request the employer to deposit the cash value of those retirement benefits--or any portion of them--in the Pro Save account of the employee at the portability clearinghouse. 
Mr. President, the funds contributed by an employer to the retirement security of his or her employees by way of a ProSave account will remain there and be invested at the direction of the employee until retirement. The portability clearinghouse will contract with investment firms to manage funds through the clearinghouse. Investment options would include a fixed income fund, an equity fund, a government securities fund, small business capitalization fund, an international fund, and an infrastructure fund. Accounts would be valued on a daily basis, and participants could transfer funds among investment accounts at intervals determined by an oversight board, perhaps at monthly or quarterly intervals. Employers will have no responsibility for administering a pension fund or managing funds for employees who have left their employment. This should be very attractive to businesses that do not desire to carry long-term responsibilities for workers who have moved on. 
While employer contributions are locked into the Pension ProSave accounts until retirement, funds contributed by the employee are available to be loaned for certain purposes and under terms established by the Portability Clearinghouse Board. 
At retirement, account balances would be paid out either in the form of an annuity--with survivor benefits--or a lump sum retirement. Spousal consent would be required. 
Mr. President, I have no doubt that some who oppose this plan will rattle the cages and make claims that this act is nothing but more big Government, another bureaucratic institution that spreads the Government further into our lives. These claims will be wrong--and will only serve to help maintain an economic reality that permits those best off in our society to save up to $30,000 a year on a tax-advantaged basis. Others in simple 401(k) plans can save up to $9,500 a year. It is unacceptable that workers who don't have an available pension plan--can only save $2,000 a year in IRA accounts. 
We have a responsibility not only to create a more equitable savings structure for those Americans who have the desire and wherewithal to save--but also to the many Americans who are low-income workers who move from job to job eventually to retirement, finding then that nothing has accrued to help them in their retirement years. 
Government had a role in establishing IRA's and 401(k)'s. Now we must do what we can to provide incentives to employers to provide modest retirement security for more employees. This plan is an enabler--it creates a structure, similar in many ways to the TIAA-CREF model established at the beginning of this century by Andrew Carnegie to provide pension portability for professors and university employees moving between one higher education institution and another. 
This is an issue in which the Government does have an important role to play because the market has failed to provide the extension of pension coverage to 51 million Americans. Pension ProSave promotes savings, helps more people reach retirement with pensions, helps buffer against the turbulence of the economy, and provides many employers with a good vehicle for profit-sharing. All of these are benefits for our Nation as a whole. 
For the employer, Pension ProSave provides a hassle-free, no red-tape way to make contributions to a pension--and frees employers from the responsibility and requirement of administering a pension plan. 
The plan also increases the amount of the tax-deferred savings permitted for the employer and each employee. It gives the employer a vehicle for profit-sharing, and the employer escapes any and all responsibility for the employee's pension. Funds contributed to Pension ProSave will be exempt from other savings limits under current law for other pension products. This should provide a powerful incentive to owners of small businesses who can save more themselves if they make equivalent commitments to their employees. 
For the employee, the benefits are most importantly that millions of pension-uncovered workers in this country will get coverage. This plan increases the amount of tax-deferred savings permitted to each employee, provides immediate vesting, and removes the concern that employees might have about the solvency of pension plans or their previous employers. Among other benefits, Pension ProSave eliminates political corruption in the administration of pension funds and provides one account that can be permanently maintained and in which funds can continually accrue no matter the number of job changes in a worker's career. 
By having national visibility, Pension ProSave would make the concept of saving for retirement more attractive and appealing to employees. This plan would increase employer pension contributions on behalf of their workers without existing pension plans, rather than relying on 401(k) plans that are funded largely by employees' voluntary saving decisions. Employers would be able to make voluntary, tax-deductible contributions on behalf of their workers and would have flexibility in the amount they contribute each year. 
Vesting would be immediate. Plan sponsors would be relieved of the expense and responsibility of providing financial education to their employees and the legal implications of providing investment options. 
Mr. President, I think that one cause of the extraordinary economic anxiety in our Nation is related to the eroding sense of financial security at retirement. A recent study of workers' views of their present and future economic circumstances found that most people believe that despite the twists, turns, and pitfalls in our rapidly changing economy, they can chart a successful course to retirement. But their anxiety levels were extremely high when concerns about the solvency of Social Security and about the great number of Americans without pension benefits were mentioned. 
Americans include retirement security in their personal strategies for economic success. I believe that America is calling for a credible proposal that will get more of our citizens covered by some kind of pensions. 
There is no doubt that the costs will be high and will impact the Nation's short term tax revenue. However, it is also clear that increasing retirement savings will help bolster national savings, which will help spur more long-term investment and economic growth. The high cost of this plan would be true of any plan that succeeds in establishing more retirement security for our working population. We seem to be willing to sustain high costs for expanding retirement opportunities for some; I just think we need to make sure that we are doing whatever we can to provide retirement savings coverage to the rest of society. 
These are costs that we must consider and should bear--for the long term benefit of our Nation in whole. Establishing Pension Pro-Save accounts is an investment that will help our Nation better able to cope with the retirement savings crisis that we will certainly face in the future.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his courtesy, as always. 
Let me speak for a few moments on a motion, or amendment, that is going to be offered by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, and myself. This is a motion to strike one provision that is in this reconciliation bill which would change the age at which senior citizens become eligible for Medicare. It raises that age from 65 to 67. Our amendment would propose to strike that provision from the reconciliation bill. In my view this is an unacceptable provision, it is very misguided, and one that we should not continue to keep in this legislation if we send this legislation on through the legislative process. 
Mr. President, there are no budgetary savings that would accrue as a result of this provision until the year 2003, after the target date for reaching the balanced budget. I am informed that this section would fall under the Byrd rule, and for that reason a vote of 60 Senators or more will be required to keep this provision in the bill, so I hope that a substantial majority of the Senate will agree with us that this provision should be stricken from the legislation. 
Raising the eligibility age for Medicare, first of all, is not necessary in order to balance the budget. The extra budget savings that this provision might generate are not necessary to meet any of the targets set by the budget negotiators in the earlier negotiation. While this change is described as being something that was done in order to bring Medicare into line with Social Security changes that were earlier made, there are obviously very real differences between Medicare and Social Security. Social Security allows an individual to receive early retirement benefits at age 62. Unlike Social Security, Medicare does not provide any other option for the retiree who wants to retire at age 65. Either the person has insurance or they do not. To make this change in Medicare, I believe, would visit a real hardship on many seniors who have planned for their entire careers to be able to retire at age 65 and to have Medicare available to them at that time. For us to make this kind of change, even though there is a long period for the phase-in of the change, I think will be breaking faith with many of those Americans and many of the people in my State. 
Raising the eligibility age creates, also, the specter of a new group of uninsured Americans. We have spent much time in the previous Congress and in this Congress debating how we can cover more Americans with health care insurance. We have too many Americans today--in my State we have way too many Americans--who do not have health care coverage. We have talked about how to cover more children, how to cover more working families, how to cover more seniors before they are eligible for Medicare. This provision that we are going to propose to strike from the reconciliation bill adds to that pool of uninsured Americans who would be without health insurance at a very critical time in their careers. Essentially, it says to them that between the age of 65, when they would normally expect to retire, and the age of 67, the responsibility for health care will be theirs. 
There are different groups of Americans and people have different circumstances. There is a large group that has no health care coverage in their employment. This would provide that there is an additional 2-year period in which they continue to have no health care coverage as they approach their senior 
years. There is another group that has health care coverage but that health care coverage terminates at the time they quit their jobs. That group, of course, would have the financial responsibility. They would have the choice to either go out and buy private health care coverage, which would be very expensive, to cover that interim period of 2 years, or they would have the choice, of course, of trying to get through that period without health care coverage, either depending upon Medicaid or hoping against hope that they do not get sick and do not need medical attention. 
Of course there are others, I should point out, who have health care coverage and whose employers have agreed to maintain that health care coverage until they reach the eligible age for Medicare. Those individuals, of course, would continue to have health care coverage under their employer but the provision we are trying to strike here would visit a hardship on the employers in that case. The provision would have an immediate impact on employers right now, who provide health benefits to individuals until they reach the age for Medicare. Companies are required today, under Financial Accounting Standard 106, to estimate their liabilities for all future retiree health benefits. Companies determine the present value of their future liabilities for those health benefits and have to report that. These figures are reported as part of the financial statements the companies make. All of those liabilities would have to be rolled into those financial statements immediately upon the adoption of this provision, if this provision were to remain part of the reconciliation bill. 
So the change that we are proposing here not only would visit a hardship on the employees, the senior citizens who are ready to retire or who have retired, it also visits a financial hardship on employers and constitutes, in many ways, an unfunded mandate on the private sector. I am sure that issue will be discussed to a great extent by the other sponsors of this legislation. A higher Medicare eligibility age would actually create a disincentive for employers to hire or retain older workers, and it would also create an additional incentive, perhaps, for them to cut back on health care benefits at an earlier time. 
Mr. President, we are in the period where employers are cutting back on additional benefits that go with employment. That trend has continued, now, for some time. I do not think there is any doubt that it is a lower percentage. I have one figure here that the American Association for Retired Persons put out that in 1973, 71 percent of large employers covered early retirees with health care coverage. By last year, that proportion was no longer 71 percent, it was down to 63 percent. Of course, that only applies to large employers. Most of the small employers in my State do not provide that coverage and most of the employees in my State, accordingly, do not have that benefit. 
Mr. President, I believe very strongly that we need to make necessary changes in the structure of Medicare in order to keep it solvent as we go forward. I support efforts to do that. I do not, though, believe it would be appropriate for us to try to improve the solvency of Medicare by reducing the number of individuals who are eligible to receive Medicare, reducing the pool of individuals who are eligible to receive those health benefits. This provision which we are trying to strike from the reconciliation bill has that exact effect. I hope very much the Senate will agree with us on this proposed amendment to strike this provision. I think this would substantially improve the legislation if we did strike this provision. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when the vote is taken on the amendment. As I understand that will be tomorrow morning.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the passage of S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997. Some of my distinguished colleagues have cited this legislation as historic in scope and worthy of support because of the consolidation of the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and parts of the Agency for International Development into the Department of State. I do not object to this consolidation, but I am concerned that the Senate is yet again infringing too much on the Presidential prerogative to be the primary architect of U.S. foreign policy. This bill gives microlevel direction on how consolidation should occur, and I feel that this is not appropriate for the Senate to be trying to micromanage the performance of our State Department agencies, offices, and employees. 
Mr. President, I have other concerns as well with S. 903. As Senators Lugar and Sarbanes have articulated, I feel that we have established inappropriate benchmarks for the United Nations in this legislation so that moneys obligated by the United States to the United Nations can be released. I feel that it is important for the United States to communicate its concerns to the United Nations about its management problems. But I also feel it is important for the United States to honor its already incurred obligations and pay our debts. Furthermore, some of the tests that we impose on the United Nations are very inappropriate. For instance, during the first year, only $100 million of the $819 million in arrears payments after a sovereignty test, which states that efforts must be taken to ensure that no U.S. law be over-ridden or changed by any action of the United Nations. I don't believe that there are many legislators in this Congress who believe for a moment that any U.N. law would purport to have such authority, nor would the United States allow such authority to be vested in the United Nations. However, the inclusion of this in S. 903 sends a signal to our constituents that this is a serious problem. I was sent to the Senate to try and address real problems, not to stir up fake ones. 
On another front, it seems to me strange that we would be abolishing two agencies and preparing for the absorption of a third into the Department of State and at the same time creating a brand-new stand-alone agency to oversee the broadcasting functions that were traditionally part of the U.S. Information Agency and under the auspices of the Board for International Broadcasting, which was abolished by the International Broadcasting Act of 1994. We should be basing our current institutional consolidations on the basis that the cold war has ended and that we need to reorganize to meet the challenges of a new and different international system. This legislation however, which sets up a structure virtually identical to the Board for International Broadcasting will cover, among other activities, our broadcasting to Cuba activities. I think that it is not wise to build new institutions, which this bill does, which will keep our Nation mired in a cold war mode. 
For these and other reasons, Mr. President, I am registering my objection to this State Department authorization bill, S. 903. I realize that this bill will pass with overwhelming support from this Chamber, but I believe that sometimes we can give away too much on the commonsense front to strike a deal.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill is entitled the Technology for Teachers Act. Its purpose is to increase the ability of millions of new and current teachers to use technology in the classroom. 
Every school day in my home State of New Mexico and across the country, computers are being purchased, are being unpacked and are being delivered to classrooms in the hope that the teachers there will do wonderful things with those computers to assist the educational process. Sometimes that happens, but most of the time, the computer that is delivered and unpacked is just one more challenge to that teacher, one more demand on that teacher's time and one more drain on the energy of that teacher, because no one has given the teacher the training necessary to be able to do wonderful things with the computer. 
Most of the teachers in our public schools today started teaching before the era of personal computers really began and was established. 
The problem begins with low standards for the preparation of teachers to use this new technology and for the licensing of new teachers. This is reflected in a chart I have, Mr. President, that I would like to call attention to. This chart demonstrates the following. On the left-hand side, we have the States that now require one course in education technology. You can see that the red area indicates that 32 States now require a course in education technology. Eighteen of our States require no instruction in education technology today. 
But the more problematic part of this chart is the right-hand side, where we try to depict the new teachers who feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. 
You can see that the green area indicates that 90 percent of our new teachers do not feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. That means 90 percent have not had adequate training, including the 90 percent who have had that one course that is required in those 32 States. So there is a serious problem. 
We also have a disturbing imbalance between the high investment we are making in equipment on the one hand and our inadequate investment in teachers on the other. Let me show a couple of other charts to make that point. 
This chart tries to make the distinction between the high availability of computers in our schools versus the low amount of teacher training to use them. Ninety-eight percent of our schools today are equipped with some computers. So, clearly, that is a major step forward from where we were, for example, 5 or 10 years ago. But if you look at the teachers who took more than 1 day of training in a single school year on how to use those computers, it is 15 percent of our teachers. Clearly, that imbalance exists. 
We are investing in the hardware; we are not investing in training the teachers to use that hardware effectively. 
Let me show one other chart to make the same point. This is connections to the Internet. This shows a 1997 estimate of the percent of schools that are connected to the Internet. About 65 percent of our schools have at least some connection to the Internet. When you look, though, down at the classroom level, you see that only 14 percent of our classrooms actually have a connection to the Internet. 
Only 13 percent of schools require some kind of advanced training for teachers so that they would know how to take advantage of that hookup to the Internet. And teachers who are actually using the Internet to help with their instruction is only 20 
percent. So, again, we have a major imbalance between the investment in the equipment on the one hand, and the inadequate investment in training our teachers on the other. The experts say that 30 percent of the total investment we make in education technology should be used to train teachers, but right now we spend only 9 percent on teacher training. In my own State of New Mexico, only 4 percent of the $33 million spent on education technology goes for training teachers. That's less than half the national average and less than one seventh what we should be spending on teacher training. 
I am not saying that the Federal Government has not invested in teacher training as a part of school reform. There is a lot of money which is available for this, but also for a great many other needs. Clearly, this chart shows that. When we talk about general reform of education, there are four large programs that the Federal Government has. Of course, Title I is by far the largest, Title VI, Goals 2000, the Eisenhower Professional Development Program--all of those programs have funds that arguably can be used for training of teachers in this respect but, in fact, there are other great demands on those funds. 
When you look at technology for education, we now have the Technology Literacy Program that is funded at $257 million. The request from the President and the agreement in this year's Budget Resolution is to substantially increase that in the coming years. But when you look at technology training for teachers, there is absolutely nothing planned for that or required to be spent on that. This legislation tries to correct that deficiency. 
There are no Federal programs today devoted exclusively to technology training for teachers--either technology training for new teachers that are being trained, or technology training for current teachers in the work force. 
Let me briefly describe what our bill would do, Mr. President. This bill has two parts. One would improve the technology training that 2 million new teachers will get while they are in college during the next decade to try to ensure that as they begin their teaching careers, they have had this instruction. 
The other part involves the technology training that millions of our current teachers will need throughout their teaching careers. 
For both parts, our legislation provides that the Department of Education would make competitive grants to the States, to the States' departments of education that are responsible for the licensing of teachers and for maintaining high teaching standards. Those States' departments would then set up competitive grant programs, one to go to colleges of education for innovative programs to train new teachers to use technology; the other set of grants would go to local school districts for innovative professional development of current teachers. 
The bill would require that the States' departments of education, the colleges of education, the local school districts, and the education technology private sector all work together to create these innovative teacher training programs. This bill would be a major step forward in providing the necessary training to our teachers so that they can benefit from new technologies and integrate those new technologies into their instruction. 
There are some very good examples, happening in a few places, of what should be happening all over the country. For example, the University of Missouri has a program that issues a laptop computer to incoming freshmen in their College of Education. It has built telecommunications links to K-through-12 schools throughout the State of Missouri. 
This bill would also support some innovative programs similar to the program we have in New Mexico called the Regional Education Technology Assistance Program; it trains five teachers from each of the school districts in my State. In fact, we have only reached out now and gotten the involvement of 52 of our 89 school districts. But the idea here is to get a cadre of teachers who are comfortable with the use of technology who can then work in their school district to train other teachers so that they, too, can be comfortable with the use of that technology and not have the technology just be a frill which is put over in the corner of their classroom for people to use when they don't have other more important activities to pursue. 
Mr. President, I think this legislation is particularly important because it tries to deal with the very real resource constraints that some of our school districts face. In my home State, we have a school district in Cuba, NM, where they have had to give up their music instruction, they have had to give up their home economics program, in order to acquire technology to try to enrich their curriculum. This would provide some additional sources of funds for them so that they could get that technology, they could get the training for the use of that technology. That is the great need that we have at this particular time. 
I hope very much that we can get a hearing on this bill this summer, move ahead with it, and enact this legislation before the conclusion of this session of the Congress. I think this is a step forward. 
We have seen significant progress over the last few years in Federal support for technology and the use of technology in education. The one great deficiency today is that we do not put enough into training teachers so that that technology can be used effectively. This legislation will help to correct that problem. 
I thank Senator Murray for cosponsoring the legislation. I hope other colleagues will do so as well.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act of 1997 and the alternative that has been offered by my friends and colleagues, Senators Baucus, Kerrey and Landrieu. 
Mr. President, while the goals embodied in S. 4 may, on the surface, appear to be family friendly, the legislation passed by the Labor Committee is decidedly worker unfriendly. 
Unlike the bill recently passed by the House, S. 4 is not limited to the issue of compensatory time. Instead it includes provisions related to flexible scheduling and flexible credit hours that repeal the 40-hour workweek, which has been the bulwark of employee protection for almost 60 years, and turn the purported choice for employees that supporters claim S. 4 provides into no real choice at all.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me first say that I am an original cosponsor of the amendment by the Senator from Illinois for funding for school construction. There is a great need in this country for this. In my view, one failure, one defect of the budget resolution before us is that we give great emphasis to higher education and very little emphasize to elementary and secondary education. The needs are great in my State for school construction funding, and I think this is a beginning. I grant it is a modest beginning, but it is a step in the right direction. I commend the Senator from Illinois for offering this amendment, and I intend to support it. 
I rise as an original cosponsor of the Mosely-Braun amendment to restore funding for school construction to the resolution. 
The lack of school construction funding is one of the many ways that this resolution reveals its strong emphasis on higher education rather than improving elementary and secondary schools. 
In fact, the lack of funding for the repair and construction of schools is perhaps the most obvious and compelling gap in this resolution. 
I believe this is especially true since New Mexico is facing such a serious problem with its schools: 
As of 1994, 94 percent of our schools needed to upgrade or repair onsite buildings, and 29 percent had crumbling roofs. 
In 1996, 44 percent of districts in New Mexico had at least one building in need of serious repair or replacement--much higher than the 33-percent average nationwide. 
Over 70 percent of high school students in my State attend schools of 900 or more students, a size that is too large to be an effective learning environment, some studies say. 
There is a $475 million backlog in school construction and repair for BIA schools, of which there are 45 in New Mexico. 
Meeting the demand to repair and build schools is difficult because New Mexico is one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, and 47 percent of its student population attends school in rural areas. 
Small and isolated communities such as these simply cannot generate sufficient funding to pay for repairing and building new schools required by skyrocketing enrollments. 
Over the last 10 years, student enrollment in New Mexico has jumped by 57,000 students, 23.7 percent. 
In just 3 years, enrollment will grow by another 20,000 students--the same number of students as are in Las Cruces, the State's second largest district. 
Having visited and heard about schools that are crumbling, incapable of handling modern computers, and overcrowded, I know 
Let me also say on the resolution more generally that clearly a balanced budget is an important component of the fiscal health for the Nation. It is very important that we pursue this. I do believe, however, that before we complete the process, before we complete a reconciliation bill and tax legislation, we need to look at the details as they will impact on the lives of average citizens in our country. 
Obviously, in my State, we have a very high rate of poverty, a high rate of inadequate health care coverage, great needs in education, great problems with unemployment. I want to be sure that the implementing legislation, particularly the tax provisions that we wind up adopting, is consistent with the needs of average citizens in my State. 
I intend to support passage of the budget resolution. I do believe it is extremely important that we are closing in on a balanced budget. That has been a goal that many have pursued, myself included, for a long time here in the Congress, and we need that type of fiscal responsibility. But I am concerned that when we get into implementing legislation, if we are not careful, we could adopt some tax provisions which would institutionalize in the next century, in the first and second decades of the next century, a new and increasing disparity between what we raise and what we spend. 
I pledge my best efforts to work with the leadership here in the Congress and in the Senate to see that that implementing legislation is acceptable and is fairly balanced. I hope that is the case, and I hope I am able to support the reconciliation bill as I intend to support this budget resolution. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank the managers for the time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during my tenure in the Senate, I have long been concerned about our Nation's economic fundamentals and long-term competitive and economic vitality. During the 1980's, budget deficits roared upward as both spending increased and major tax cuts were enacted. As Senator Hollings mentioned here last night, it can be an intoxicating combination to slash taxes for constituents while pumping up spending. This is what we did in those years. In a way, we just stole from the future, from our childrens' future and from the strength of the economy that they will live in. 
Fortunately in 1993, we turned this trend around. Since passage of the 1993 budget, our Nation has shaved $2.5 trillion off of our budget deficit. This is a stunning turnaround for our country, and we are on the verge of achieving the kind of balance and fiscal responsibility that I have been fighting for these many years. If the truth be told, this balanced budget resolution, which we are debating now, is rather modest and only cuts another $207 billion off during the next 5 years. This is a tenth of what we accomplished in 1993. However, this resolution is vastly better than the draconian and unfair budget package the Republican majority tried to pass in 1995. 
Our fiscal prudence has brought down interest rates, helped increase investment and business activity, and increased our employment levels dramatically. Continuing this trend makes sense for our Nation and makes sense for New Mexico. 
Balancing the budget is an important component of fiscal health--but we would be making a great mistake--to think that this solves all of our economic problems. We need to know the details of the tax framework, which we will soon debate, to fully understand how this budget will impact the lives and quality of life of our citizens. New Mexico is still trailing much of the Nation, and has a long way to go before my State will share as it should in the growth of this economy. New Mexicans have the lowest level of pension coverage in the Nation; the lowest level of health care coverage; the highest poverty rate in the Nation and the only State in the Nation to worsen its poverty level during the last 2 years; we also have the highest unemployment levels west of the Mississippi. 
New Mexico is not expecting large hand-outs to improve its situation--but we need to be sure that the budget framework we are debating here--and the follow-on tax bill, which represents the small print at the bottom of the contract--impacts New Mexico fairly in relation to other parts of the Nation. I want to make sure that we invest in education, which provides the best chance for the people of my State to get ahead. And I want to make sure that any tax cuts we provide are responsible, equitable, and reward the hard working families in New Mexico and across the country. 
While I support this budget, we need to be honest about the fact that this budget does not deal with the looming challenge of increased Social Security and Medicare entitlement spending caused by the aging of the Baby Boom generation. Also, we are not incorporating any structural changes in our defense spending. In fact, it is hardly reflected in this budget that the Soviet Union has dissolved and that strategic threats to our Nation have dramatically decreased. Our defense strategy seems to be primarily the product of inertia. 
Although the details of the accompanying tax bills are not yet clear, there are some items that concern me greatly. First, I am concerned that the $500 per child tax credit is not clearly specified as refundable. If this is not refundable, it means that low-income working families in New Mexico will not significantly benefit from this provision and will largely help those who are already better off in our society; 45 percent of the tax filers in New Mexico have adjusted gross incomes below $15,000; 70 percent have income levels below $30,000. This means that the majority of those in my State--and probably others--will not benefit much from this per child tax credit unless we make this credit refundable. 
In the areas of capital gains relief, inheritance tax exclusions, and IRA tax cuts, I see something very dangerous brewing that we must not allow to happen. While I don't want to see Medicare cuts made just to put money in the pockets of the wealthy, I can support reasonable tax cuts--as long as they do not come at the expense of achieving real balance in our budget or at the expense of improving our schools or environment. But in this deal, $85 billion in cuts is pledged during the first 5 years of the agreement--and nearly double that amount, $165 billion, is pledged in the following 5 years, 2003-7. Given that the tax cuts are priced at $42 billion in the 10th year of this program--and are increasing at a rate of $5 billion a year during the last 3 years--we can logically anticipate tax cuts in the vicinity of $500 billion or more, or over half a trillion dollars, during the next 10 years 2008-17. 
What is alarming about this is that if the numbers I just cited are believable, then all of this celebration on balancing the budget could be premature. The effect of a tax package with these characteristics would be to reduce taxes on well-off Americans by half a trillion dollars, while leaving middle and lower income working Americans with very little relief. A half trillion dollar reduction in our Federal revenues could throw our budget again into substantial deficit. And just at the time that we have discovered that we are once again living beyond our means, then the crushing entitlement costs of retiring Baby Boomers will hit us. 
I hope we can develop a tax bill that will avoid this result--and I 
am confident that this budget resolution can be complied with in a fiscally responsible manner.  
EDUCATION 
As others have said before me, this budget resolution and the balanced budget agreement should be applauded for including many key education programs, including provisions such as increases in Pell grants to $3,000 per student, a new $35 billion program to help more students attend college, and substantial increases in funding for education technology, Goals 2000 grants to States, and other programs to help improve elementary and secondary education. 
Despite these important elements, however, I believe there are at least two key remaining issues we should address if we hope to make this resolution a blueprint for a more effective system of public education. 
The first of these education issues is school construction. Our schools' need for funding for school repair and construction is perhaps the most obvious and compelling need that is ignored in this resolution. 
With a student population that is 47 percent rural and a significant portion of the Nation's BIA schools, New Mexico is facing a school construction problem that exceeds that of many other States. Over 90 percent of New Mexico's schools need to upgrade or repair onsite buildings; 44 percent of districts report having at least one building in need of serious repair or replacement. And as one of the fastest-growing States in the Nation, over 70 percent of our high school students are forced to attend schools that are as large or larger than the 900-student maximum at which student achievement begins to deteriorate. 
For this reason, I am an original cosponsor of the Moseley-Braun amendment to restore $5 billion in funding to help local school construction efforts. 
A second educational issue we need to address is rigorous standards for students receiving tuition tax deductions. Now that the President and the leadership have agreed on the need to develop a new $35 billion program to help more students go on to college, it will be essential to ensure that these students are prepared to succeed once they arrive. 
For the proposed $10,000 tax deduction, we need to find uniform and rigorous measures of academic preparedness to ensure that these funds are being used effectively. 
A clear measure of academic preparation is necessary because it is increasingly clear that fewer and fewer of those enrolling are receiving adequate preparation to meet the challenge of college-level work. And as a result, more and more students are dropping out, taking remedial courses, or struggling academically. 
However, linking eligibility for these tax benefits to a student's grade point average--whether it be in college or in high school--ignores the fact that grades are not a sufficiently uniform or rigorous measure, given the decentralized nature of our schools and colleges. 
We need to consider more uniform measures, including widely used examinations and adaptations of other assessments for high school students that may be available. Without taking reasonable steps to ensure the academic readiness of students, this new investment to encourage more students to attend college could be a cruel and expensive hoax. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this issue when the tax bill is being considered later this year. 
Mr. President, I will support passage of this budget resolution and am glad that we are finally closing in on a balanced budget and the kind of fiscal responsibility that benefits our Nation and our people. But I support this resolution somewhat concerned about the implementing language. If we are not careful, we could adopt legislation which institutionalizes a disparity between what we raise and what we spend. 
I pledge my best effort to see that the end result of all these efforts is of benefit to working families in my State and it is the hope that we will arrive at such an end result that causes me to vote `Aye' on the resolution.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on behalf of this amendment by the Senator from Connecticut. 
I think, to put this in context, at least as I see it, this budget resolution is a blueprint for taking us into the next century. It sets out our priorities as a nation as we go into the next century, what we think it is important to spend our resources on, and what can we justify to the people who elect us in our States for spending resources on. 
I believe very strongly that we can justify to our constituents, to those who vote for us and those who vote against us, we can justify to any of them the additional expenditure for the Head Start Program that the Senator from Connecticut is recommending here. 
I look at my home State and the inadequate funding that we have for Head Start there, and it is a great concern. Let me give you a few specifics. In a State like mine, New Mexico, for example, 16 percent of the eligible children under age 5 are enrolled in Head Start. That is in the 1995 fiscal year. The national average is around 20 percent; in my State, it is 16 percent. There are only 1,000 of the 8,000 eligible children that are being served by Head Start in our principal city of Albuquerque, NM, which is about 12 percent of the eligible children in Albuquerque being served. I had the good fortune of visiting a Head Start center and was impressed by the opportunities being offered to those young people, but for them to tell me there are 8,000 eligible students or eligible children who are not able to participate in Albuquerque, I think, is a real concern. 
Despite the clear need and several proposals to obtain funding that received higher ratings, my State has no early Head Start programs. The early Head Start programs are for the students that are less than 3, as I understand it, and there are some of those around the country but very few. We will have another amendment later on in the budget debate here about the importance of early childhood education and the tremendous impact of trying to work with children from the age of birth until 3 years old. Early Head Start programs provide, fill a need there, and we are doing too little. In my State, we have no, absolutely no early Head Start programs. 
Increasing Head Start participation to 1 million children by the year 2002, as has been proposed in the resolution, would only increase participation by about 200,000 children, as I understand it. We need to add 1 million children to Head Start, not reach the total of 1 million by the year 2002. 
For these reasons, I am glad to cosponsor the amendment of Senator Dodd, and glad to speak on behalf of this amendment. 
Let me say we need to recognize here on the floor, we have a lot of talk about what we can afford and what we cannot afford. We are the wealthiest nation in the world. We have the largest economy of any nation in the world. We are able to afford what we determine is a priority in our country. 
Unfortunately, we have not determined that it is a priority to fully fund Head Start. This amendment would correct that very major defect in this budget resolution. I strongly support it. I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the last few years, many of us have been trying to figure out how to solve some of the troubling questions surrounding public education. These issues include two core questions, one about inadequate academic standards and the the other about the skyrocketing cost of going on to college. 
What can we do to improve the standards of academic performance in our schools and, how can we make college more affordable to more of our students? 
One very straightforward answer is to expand the number of advanced placement courses taught in our schools and to increase the number of students who have the opportunity to take those courses. 
Let me briefly describe what an advanced placement, or AP, course really is. The AP program is a set of college-level courses that are usually taught to high school juniors and seniors for college credit. They are taken on a voluntary basis. These courses are now taught in a majority of our high schools. They use locally developed materials. However, the year-end AP exams are evaluated on a uniform basis, making test scores comparable nationwide. Overall, there are 30 different AP courses, although most students take them in the areas of math and history and science and English. 
Today, I rise to introduce the College Affordability and High Standards Act of 1997, which is also being cosponsored by Senators Hutchison, Mikulski, Bumpers and Collins. This legislation will allow thousands of additional high school students to participate in AP courses. The bill focuses on low-income and minority students who often attend school in less affluent or in isolated areas. 
I am introducing this bill based in part on several recent visits to New Mexico high schools, where I learned that what students want is more well-trained teachers. They are asking for more challenging academic work. In my home State, in schools like West Mesa High School in Albuquerque and Las Cruces High School, AP students told me they never thought they could succeed in classes that are this challenging. There is great satisfaction and pride, evidenced by their ability to succeed. 
While it may seem new, this is not an entirely new approach to raising academics and lowering college costs. In fact, we have had legislation proposed before by Senator Kassebaum and a bipartisan group of other Members, which became law in 1992 and is still in effect. We are just building on this approach. In addition, Secretary Riley, the late President of the AFT Al Shanker, and Boston Schools Superintendent Tom Payzant have spoken out on this. 
Most importantly, 23 States today provide some type of incentive program to encourage more AP participation. I have a chart I want to show my colleagues to make the point, which shows where there are initiatives to promote AP instruction. 
The States in white do not have an incentive program in place. We need to supplement the 23 States listed on this map with AP programs in the other 27 States, and we need to have every State in the Union promoting more advance placement courses. In essence, that is the purpose of this legislation. 
There is a long-outdated myth that I want to address very briefly about what type of students take these AP courses. There has been in the past the impression that AP courses are only for the elite. The truth is, more and more students from minority groups from various backgrounds are taking AP courses today, as this chart shows, with out a decrease in rigor or quality. 
Roughly 1.5 million students participated--80 percent from public schools, 55 percent female, and 30 percent minority. 
Almost 60 percent of all high schools offered AP courses, and over 800,000 exams were taken. 
As a result of this growth, the AP program is the most widely accepted program of high academic standards in the nation.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me point out the general framework of this discussion as I understand it. 
The administration, in the supplemental request that they sent to Congress, suggested that we needed to add $318 million in order to essentially continue a windfall that had been in the previous law to various States under the highway funding formula. There was 24 States. And this was what I would refer to as the 1997 fix. For fiscal year 1997, we were saying, essentially the administration was saying, look, these States expected to get more than they really should have been getting, but we will give them this $318 million to divide among these 24 States. 
Then, in the supplemental, we first saw a proposal to add some additional money for 10 other States, and that was added by the subcommittee chairman in the Appropriations Committee, not for fiscal year 1997 but for fiscal year 1996, and he was saying, OK, you have made good to these States for this windfall that was represented to them for 1997; what about for 1996? They ought to get the money they expected in 1996 as well, and he added money for that. 
Now, the Appropriations Committee has come along and said, what we are going to do, if all this windfall money is going out to these 24 States--and, clearly, that is what is happening here, and I am not opposed to that, but they are saying if all that money is going out to these windfall States, let us at least hold harmless the rest of the States. Let us make sure they do not see an absolute cut in the level of funding for highways in this current year over 1996. So it is essentially a save harmless provision. It says that although we are going to give this money to these 24 States that expected to get the money, we are not going to have it adversely affect any of the other States, and that is the provision which Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd have reported to the full Senate here. 
The Warner amendment, of course, comes along and says, no, we do not want to save harmless these other States. We, in fact, want to go ahead and cut some of those States' funding from what they did receive in 1996, and, clearly, that to me is not a fair arrangement. 
If this group of States is going to get the windfall, which the administration requested and which the appropriations subcommittee has added, then all other States should be held harmless, and that is what the bill does at this time. The Warner amendment would eliminate that hold-harmless provision and would result in States like mine getting less money than we otherwise would. 
So I think, clearly, the Warner amendment should be defeated. The committee proposal here is by far the fairest of the proposals, and I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating the Warner amendment. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

<TEXT>
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about my amendment No. 69, which strikes section 305 of this supplemental appropriations bill. 
Section 305 of the bill states that `Section 5803 of Public Law 104-208 is hereby repealed.' That is a very economical formulation, but it doesn't tell the reader much about the substantive issues at stake. For this reason, I would like to take some time to describe to my colleagues what I think the key issues underlying section 305 in the supplemental appropriations bill are, and why I believe section 305 is an unwise step and should be stricken from this bill. 
Section 305 repeals a $100 million appropriation to a Department of Defense program known as the Dual-Use Applications Program. By doing so, it eliminates one of the two major initiatives in this program. The Dual-Use Applications Program is just getting started. It was authorized for the first time in last year's Defense Authorization Act. Because of this, most of the money appropriated last year has not yet been spent. Awards are now just being made and announced. So, at a very superficial level, the $100 million looks attractive as a candidate for rescission. 
But the Dual-Use Applications Program is, in my view, essential to our future national defense. This program will introduce major technological changes and cost savings in military applications, and major cultural changes in how the Department of Defense manages R&D. We have forged a bipartisan consensus on the Senate Armed Services Committee in favor of this program. Once my colleagues in the Senate understand what this program is all about, I am confident that they will agree with me that gutting the Dual-Use Applications Program at its inception is a very bad idea for our long-term national security. 
America's Armed Forces today enjoy technological supremacy over any potential adversary. This is not an accident. It is the result of two things: wise past investments in defense R&D and competent advocacy from the top echelons of DOD for moving the fruits of that R&D into practice. 
Our current recipe for maintaining military technological supremacy, though, is not a guarantee of future success. In fact, to ensure that our men and women in uniform maintain their technological edge over any future adversary, we will need a new strategy for defense technology. In this strategy, we will have to rely more on the commercial sector to provide defense technologies, through adaptation of cutting-edge commercial technologies to military use, rather than developing the same technology in isolation in a MILSPEC world. 
There are two forces driving this new overall technology strategy. 
The first force is the constrained budget for defense R&D. Defense R&D, like all defense spending, is under tremendous pressure as we move toward a balanced budget. We no longer have an open checkbook for defense scientists and engineers, as we essentially did during the cold war. Thus, we need to spend our funds more strategically, and seek ways to leverage our defense R&D dollars. with R&D investments being made by other funding sources. 
The second force driving the defense world toward greater use of commercial technologies is the fact that technological advances from commercial R&D are outpacing similar advances from military R&D in many applications important to national defense. For example, the military is faced with an explosion of requirements for 
rapid and widespread processing and dissemination of information. The commercial world has led the development of the Internet, despite its origins in DARPA, and there is now much that the defense world can learn from the commercial world's experience with distributed information processing and communication. 
Despite the emergence of these two new forces, the defense world is not used to, and is not prepared for, working with the commercial R&D sector in a radically new manner. It is used to thinking about its own, supposedly unique, defense requirements and perhaps some subsequent defense spinoff to commercial applications. It is not used to thinking about common requirements between defense and commercial applications and desirability of commercial `spin-ons' to defense applications. 
This is where the Dual-Use Applications Program, established by section 203 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997, comes in. The missions of this program are to a prototype and demonstrate new approaches for DOD to use in leveraging commercial research, technology, products, and processes for military systems. 
Over the long term, these new approaches to working with industry must become widespread throughout DOD, in order for the Department to take full advantage of the technological opportunities afforded by the commercial sector. These leveraging approaches are not widespread in DOD today, by DOD's own admission. While acquisition reform has helped clear the path to a new relationship between DOD and the commercial sector, DOD reports that its experience to date with acquisition reform has shown that leveraging approaches are unfamiliar to many in DOD and are not widely adopted in the services. 
There are two initiatives now underway in the Dual-Use Applications Program. Both encourage the leveraging, by the services, of the commercial sector's research, products, and processes for the benefit of DOD and the Nation's defense capabilities. 
The first initiative is in science and technology research and development. It is very important, and I will describe it at some length. It is not immediately affected by this supplemental appropriations bill, in its current form, but I understand that it is likely to become a target for cuts in a conference. I hope that, after I finish my statement, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee can give me some assurance that he will resist attempts to cut the Science and Technology Initiative. 
The second initiative is zeroed out by section 305 of this supplemental appropriations bill. It is a Commercial Operations and Support Savings Initiative that will prototype an approach that the service can use to insert, on a routine basis, commercial products and processes into already-fielded military systems to reduce operations and support costs. 
Section 305 of the bill would repeal section 5803 of last year's Defense Appropriations Act. That provision provides $100 million in funding for DOD's commercial operations and support savings initiative, known as COSSI. Under the COSSI program, DOD plans to insert new commercial technologies into weapons systems to reduce operations and support costs. 
I am concerned that the elimination of this program could increase defense costs in the long run. DOD has learned that for many weapons systems, operations and support costs far exceed acquisition costs. By investing in upgraded commercial technologies with improved performance, the Department hopes to bring operations and support costs down in the long run.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Having made the case for restoring funds to the COSSI program, I would like to state my hope that such restoration not come at the expense of other dual-use technology programs that will benefit the Department of Defense. The Senate Armed Services Committee has carefully reviewed and authorized the dual use science and technology research element of the Dual Use Application Program as provided for in section 203 of the National Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997. Programs developed under this section will provide major enhancements in our military capabilities and can also benefit the commercial sector. Cooperation between DOD and the private sector will provide dual use benefits at a significantly lower cost to the government.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, during the last several days, I have expressed concerns about various provisions and amendments on this supplemental appropriations Bill. In the end, however, I believe that this bill addresses not only New Mexico's transportation infrastructure needs but also many of the disaster relief demands facing other parts of the Nation, and I will vote for passage. 
Unfortunately, this bill's continuing resolution provisions--which call for automatic across-the-board cuts--if the Congress fails to pass our appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year is a poor and unacceptable way to legislate. I strongly oppose this provision which does remain in the supplemental appropriations bill. I am hopeful that this provision will be struck in conference and support the President's promised veto if this provision is not struck. 
These supplemental appropriations bills should focus on the most pressing needs of the Nation--particularly natural disasters that call for our care and attention. We should not be cluttering these bills with provisions such as the continuing resolution provision which either the Conference Committee or the President must remove.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this morning the Federal Communications Commission made its ruling on implementation of the Universal Services Fund. They passed it by a 4-to-0 vote supporting the findings of the Federal-State joint board. This decision by them has opened the door to affordable Internet access for schools, libraries, and hospitals throughout this country. 
I want to congratulate Commissioner Hundt and his colleagues on the Commission for their leadership and their commitment to putting technology to work in our schools and in our communities. 
I also want to congratulate my colleagues, Senator Snowe, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Exon, and Senator Kerrey, especially, for their leadership in proposing the Universal Services discount as a provision in the Telecommunications Act which we passed last year. 
Their hard work on behalf of education technology was critical in getting us to this point. 
This Universal Services Fund will provide telecommunications discounts of between 20 and 90 percent, depending in part on the income levels of families in the particular school communities. 
I have done some back-of-the-envelope calculations about my State, and, as far as I can determine, the FCC's decision could mean a discount of more than 70 percent for many New Mexico schools. 
Education technology is important to my State. We have all seen how it can allow even the smallest or most isolated school across the State to develop a level playing field with larger school districts and, in fact, with wealthier States. 
In a cost-effective manner, education technology can provide advanced courses and access to amazing amounts of information for all of our students. 
That is why I am very proud. In 1994, we passed an act that I proposed entitled `Technology in Education Act.' That act will provide $200 million to America's schools for purchase of advanced technology. It has brought $1.7 million to my home State of New Mexico this year alone. 
I support the President's request in his budget to increase the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund from $200 million this year to $425 million next year. 
The 1994 Technology in Education Act also created the Regional Technology in Education Consortia, these consortia providing schools and school districts with the technical assistance that they need to be full participants in this information age. 
This technical assistance will be more needed than ever now that the telecommunications costs will be less of an obstacle to schools seeking connections to the Internet. 
Our country has also made some progress in raising the awareness of the need for high academic standards. I serve on the National Education Goals Panel, and, as such, I have supported the effort to build a nation of learners, and education technology is an important part of doing that. 
One of the things that we have to do a better job of clearly is training teachers to be comfortable with this new technology. I believe we need to pursue legislation on this area this Congress. I hope to have a part in that. 
In my view, the educational technology movement will change the way people teach and learn from now on. 
Distance learning is more than delivering instruction any time and anywhere, although that is an important part of what is involved. It is also about giving teachers the resources that they need to be effective as learning coaches. It is about empowering students to explore and learn in ways that are best for them as individuals. 
Today's FCC ruling is an important step forward. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to help ensure that our teachers and schoolchildren have the best technology that we can offer as we prepare them for the 21st century. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit about the supplemental appropriations bill, which I gather will be on the floor here probably next week, and this issue which has come to light about the effort to put a so-called continuing resolution onto the supplemental appropriations bill. I want to just try to make sense out of that as best I understand it and describe my recollection of things. 
There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about the shutdown of Government that occurred in the last Congress. I was here at that time and I remember the occasion. What was happening, as I recall it, was that the President indicated very clearly in public statements and private statements, in a variety of ways, that he would not sign appropriations bills that contained major cuts in education and some of the funds for enforcement of the environmental laws in particular. Those were areas of great concern to the President. He indicated that he wanted Congress to agree with him to maintain funding in those areas--not necessarily increase it, but at least maintain funding in some of those areas before he would sign those bills. 
In spite of those statements to that effect, the majority here in Congress sent those bills to the President and he vetoed them. Accordingly, we had a shutdown of the Government. There was no funding available through that appropriations process for those areas of the Government that were covered by those appropriations bills. So, essentially, what was going on was that the majority in Congress was trying to force-feed the President to accept some proposals and some cuts in funding that he was not willing to accept, and that precipitated a crisis. Some felt strongly. Some in the majority party--the Republican Party--at the time felt strongly enough about it that they were willing to just keep the Government shut down and not send another continuing resolution, not agree to fund Government at the steady State level, but to allow the Government to stay shut down as a way of gaining leverage in those negotiations. I believe it was on the 18th day of, I think, the second shutdown when Senator Dole, the leader in the Senate, finally came to the Senate floor and spoke and said that he believed enough was enough and he himself was going to urge that a continuing resolution be passed in order to go ahead and at least keep the Government funded on a steady-state basis while negotiations between the President and the Congress continued. I came to the floor right after Senator Dole spoke, or I was here at the time he spoke, and I commended him for his decision to break with the House leadership and to go ahead, after 18 days of shutdown, and finally go ahead and fund these departments of the Government. Many of his colleagues here in the Senate followed his lead after that and agreed to go ahead and pass a continuing resolution to fund those areas of the Government. 
That was the shutdown, as I recall it. That is a general description of the shutdown that occurred. What we have now is a bill to provide very important funding for a variety of subjects. It is all wrapped into this supplemental 
appropriation. It is a supplemental, of course, because it is not one of the regular appropriations bills which we do each year. It is a supplemental that comes at an unusual time, and the time that we are dealing with this has been driven, perhaps as much as anything, by the natural disasters that have occurred in particular parts of the country, in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and in some other areas as well. There are some other provisions in this supplemental which are also very important. My home State of New Mexico will be able to receive, under this supplemental, $14 million of desperately needed highway funds, which should have been provided to us under last year's bill and which I made a major point about in the last Congress. We had been fighting to get this money for over 6 months. We lost it in the last set of appropriations bills. 
This year, we have been able to persuade the appropriators to include it in this supplemental, and I think that is a very important step forward. So there are provisions in this bill that are important to my State highway funds, title I funds, as well as, of course, the provisions that are intended to assist with the disaster relief, which is so needed by many families that have been devastated by the weather and by the floods that they have experienced in recent weeks in these areas of the Midwest. So that is where we are. 
The problem has come up that there is an amendment being included in the supplemental appropriation that is another continuing resolution, and it says that essentially if we adopt that amendment, it would say that if the Republican majority in Congress does not send the President an appropriations bill he will sign, an acceptable appropriations bill, in any area, there will be allowed to be continued funding in those areas at a rate of 2 percent less than this current fiscal year. The difficulty with it, of course, is that it again changes the dynamic very greatly against a real compromise occurring between the Executive and the Congress on these very important funding issues. 
It says to the President, `Look. Before, you had the ability to veto an appropriations bill which you disagreed with, and then everyone had to go back to the table.' Now, if we add this continuing resolution provision to the supplemental, that requirement won't be there anymore because there will be no pressure on the Republican Congress to go back to the table and negotiate further with the President. The President will, if we send an appropriations bill that he determines is unacceptable for whatever reason and he vetoes it, as called for in the Constitution, then there is no pressure on the Republican leaders in Congress to renegotiate. They will have in place at that point a continuing resolution, which will have been part of the supplemental, which says we are going to fund everything, and, by the way, the funding level is going to be 2 percent less than it was in the previous year, or, in the case of areas such as education, it is going to be 7 percent less than he requested for this year. That will be the steady rate, and that will be the continuing situation from now on. So there is no pressure for the compromise that the Constitution contemplates between the executive branch and the legislative branch to occur. I think it is a very ill-advised provision. 
I think the President is taking the right position by saying that he will not agree to this kind of continuing resolution being adopted as part of this supplemental. But basically, if the Congress says to the President,  
If you want this relief for these flood victims, if you want this money for highways in New Mexico, if you want this money for Head Start, or for title I, or any of the other provisions in this supplemental, then you have to agree to a spending level that is 2 percent below this current year's level in all of these other areas, unless we are able to send you something else that is preferable at a later date. 
This is not an acceptable proposal. I think the President is correct in refusing to agree to it. 
We on the Democratic side are correct in refusing to agree to it. What we should do, and what I believe the American people would like us to do, is to go ahead and approve the supplemental appropriations bill, go ahead and appropriate the funds for flood relief, go ahead and appropriate the funds for the additional highway funding, go ahead and appropriate the additional funds for title I. Then we can have a debate, as we go through the rest of this year, on the budget resolution and on the appropriations bills. We can have a debate about what the right level of spending ought to be in each of these other areas. 
We should not at the very beginning, before we have a budget resolution, before we have any appropriations bills, have some kind of legal provision that says, unless the President agrees to what the Republican majority in Congress sends him, that he has to settle for a 2-percent cut in all areas: education, environmental protection, and all of the other areas. 
That is what this continuing resolution provision would do. It needs to be dropped from the supplemental appropriations bill if we are going to go ahead and pass this supplemental appropriations and have it signed into law. It is very important that it be signed into law, and sooner rather than later. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield myself such time as I will consume out of that 31 minutes. 
Mr. President, when I hear the debate here on the floor, it strikes me that anyone who is watching or listening to this debate must think that we are talking past each other. It must appear that we do not seem to be able to engage on any one subject. One Senator comes to the floor and talks about voluntarism, the need to protect volunteers from liability; another Senator talks about Alexis Herman, the President's nominee for Secretary of Labor and the need to get that nomination confirmed. People cannot understand why we are not talking about the same thing. 
Let me just give my perspective of where we are. 
On the Democratic side, the position that many of us are taking is that we should not be going ahead with business as usual in the Senate on the last day of April unless we can get the majority to agree to allow a vote on the President's Cabinet nominee. We are getting fairly far into this year. 
The President, several months ago, nominated Alexis Herman to be the Secretary of Labor. In the Labor and Human Resources Committee we voted unanimously to recommend to the full Senate that she be confirmed for that position. Just in the last couple of weeks we have been told that vote will not be taken on the Senate floor, we will not have a chance to vote for her confirmation because some on the Republican side disagree with the President's Executive order on another issue related to project labor agreements. He issued an Executive order on that subject which they did not agree with. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Alexis Herman to be our Secretary of Labor. Our committee, the Labor Committee, did report that nomination to the full Senate for consideration. We did so unanimously. This was not a Democratic vote and Republicans opposed. It was a unanimous vote. Unfortunately, we have not been able to go ahead and take that vote on the Senate floor. 
When I tried to put this in some perspective--I have served here in the Senate with three different Presidents in the White House. President Reagan, when he was in the White House--of course, much of the time that he was there the Republicans controlled the Senate, so an issue like this never arose. But there were 2 years during which he was President when the Democrats controlled the Senate. I am not aware of any occasion where we refused to allow a vote on one of his nominations because we disagreed with one of the policies that President Reagan was pursuing. We certainly disagreed with many of his policies, but I cannot recall any occasion where we refused to go ahead and permit a vote on one of his nominees in order to gain leverage and force him to change a policy. 
The same thing with President Bush. When President Bush was in office, of course the Democrats controlled the Senate during that time, and he nominated his Cabinet members. I do not recall any effort on the Democratic side to refuse to allow a vote on those Cabinet Members. I think everyone agreed that the election was over, the President had the right to choose his own Cabinet, and that we in the Senate could object to some of those Cabinet individuals and we could vote no on their nomination, but we certainly would not deny the President the right to a vote on those Cabinet members. 
So I see what is happening here with Alexis Herman's nomination as sort of unprecedented, clearly unprecedented in the time that I have been here in the Senate in the last 14 years. 
I understand that some of my colleagues are opposed to the administration's plans to issue an Executive order on project labor agreements. I know that many of my colleagues may have fundamental disagreements about the appropriateness of that Executive order. This is, in my view, simply not adequate grounds for refusing to go ahead and have a vote on his Cabinet nominee. 
I personally support the administration's proposal on project labor agreements for a variety of reasons. And we can have that debate when the issue comes up. As my friend from Wyoming, my colleague from Wyoming, indicates, there is a bill being considered. Fine. Let us get a piece of legislation out here. Let us have a vote on it. Let us do whatever and send it to the President, and perhaps we can persuade him to sign something if we can get agreement on something that seems reasonable. 
But the Executive order on project labor agreements has nothing to do with whether or not the President should be able 
to appoint his own Cabinet. We should allow him to do that. We should certainly allow a vote on the Senate floor on those Cabinet nominees. If the majority wants to turn down a nomination in order to make some point, clearly that is a course they can pursue. But to deny a vote on the Senate floor in order to try to register a complaint about the President's policy, I think, is improper. 
Ms. Herman presented herself extremely well to the Labor Committee. She honestly and fully answered all questions put to her. I think she won over several Senators who might have thought, going into that hearing, that they might not support her. She will be a strong advocate for working families. She will work hard, I am persuaded, to help our country prepare for the next century. Her record of public service, her record of caring about people on issues that come before the Department of Labor, which is unquestioned, her commitment to serving her country are the reasons why all of us, as I said on the Democratic and Republican side, in the committee joined to send her nomination to the floor. 
I know that if we get a vote on the Senate floor, it will be an overwhelming vote of support for this nominee because all of the Senators I have talked to believe she would be a good Secretary of Labor. 
The working families of this country deserve to have someone in that position which is a very important position at this time in our history. It is getting late in the legislative year. We need to go ahead and allow the President to put his own nominee in there so that he can proceed with his agenda. 
I say there will be many opportunities over the course of this year and next year throughout the 105th Congress where we will debate issues such as project labor agreements here on the Senate floor. I think that is entirely as it should be. But I do not think it is appropriate for us to proceed with business as usual on the Senate floor while refusing to allow a vote on the President's nominee for Secretary of Labor. 
So that is the basis for my objection to proceeding on this bill that is pending before the Senate today. I think it is a credible piece of legislation which should be debated and should be seriously considered by the Senate. But it should be seriously considered by the Senate in a circumstance where we are allowing the Executive branch and allowing the President to go ahead and name his Cabinet. It is too late in the year for us to be playing the kind of cynical game that is going on here in denying a vote for this Secretary of Labor. 
So I urge my colleagues to join on a bipartisan basis to bring that nomination to the floor and have that vote and then proceed to consideration of this other legislation and then proceed to the consideration of a great deal of other legislation that we should be getting on with. 
I think it is clear that the Senate is rudderless at this point. We have very little on the Senate agenda. We look ahead to the next 2 or 3 weeks, and I do not see a great deal of constructive activity going forward here unless there is much more in the planning than I am aware of. But I do think the least we can do is to go ahead and get one important nomination up and vote on it at the soonest date possible. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you. 
I thank the manager of the bill, the Senator from Delaware, for yielding me time. 
I also commend my colleague from Nebraska. I sat through a meeting with him and the Senator from Delaware at the White House where he asked some very penetrating questions. The President and the Vice President were there. The Secretary of State was there. Our Ambassador to the United Nations and a great many individuals who studied this treaty were there. And I am very pleased to see the decision that our colleague from Nebraska has made. 
Mr. President, a point that was made by the Senator from Nebraska I think needs to be foremost in our minds, and that is that this is different from all other treaties that have come before the Senate since I have been here, in that this does not ask us to give up any military capability that we have not already decided to give up. 
Most treaties involve an agreement by us to give up military capability in return for other nations giving up military capability. But we have decided unilaterally during the Reagan administration and have maintained the policy ever since then that we are going to renounce the use of chemical weapons, destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons. What this treaty does is try to find ways to bring other nations to that same decision. 
President Reagan did commit to that in the 1980's. President Bush reiterated that position. President Clinton has certainly done so as well. That is a central part of this discussion that needs to be kept in mind. 
A second part of the discussion that needs to be kept in mind is that by going ahead and ratifying this treaty, we give up no other tools that we have to prevent chemical attack or to retaliate against someone who might begin a chemical attack. 
This is not: Do you want to have the ability to retaliate, or, on the contrary, do you want the treaty? We are going to retain in the future all capabilities to retaliate which we presently have. We stated very definitively in one of the conditions that is attached to this treaty that we will use a massive force to respond to any chemical attack. We do not consider a chemical weapons attack by a potential adversary or adversary to be comparable to a conventional attack; therefore, people need to know that we are not giving up any of our abilities or resolve in that regard. 
I think these two factors are persuasive. We have chosen to destroy our own chemical weapons anyway, whether this treaty goes into effect or not. And, second, we maintain the ability to retaliate against any chemical weapons attack with all the strength that we have today. 
So what does the treaty buy us? 
It buys us an international agreement with other nations that will, hopefully, bring them also to give up their chemical weapons stockpiles. And it puts in place mechanisms to ensure that they do that. 
It buys us a guarantee that other nations which might have chosen to build chemical weapons will find it much more difficult to do so. 
It buys us a likelihood that if anyone decides to cheat on the treaty, we will have the ability to detect that. It enhances our intelligence-gathering capability substantially. As the Director of the CIA testified--he said this treaty gives us tools that we do not now have to look into places where we cannot now look. 
There have been some concerns raised. I will not go into those. I think they have been addressed extensively in the various conditions that have already been added to the treaty. 
Let me just say a few words about the amendments that are being proposed. 
The first amendment calls for us to withhold ratification until the Russian Duma agrees to the ratification and agrees to comply with an earlier statement about the destruction of chemical weapons. 
Mr. President, what this does is essentially make our foreign policy and our national policy hostage to what the hard-liners in the Russian Duma decide to do. It gives the Russians an excuse for not ratifying the treaty if we do not. I think it would be contrary to our best interests. 
A second amendment that will be offered, which I will oppose--or second effort to strike that I will support, deals with an amendment that would destroy the potential benefits of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It would require us to withhold ratification until various other countries, such as China, North Korea, Libya, and others, have ratified the treaty. 
Again, this provision would essentially shift to others the ability to define what is in our own best national interest. That cannot be a good thing for the United States. 
A third amendment deals with requiring us to reject inspectors from countries that have supported terrorism. 
Mr. President, we have the ability under the treaty to reject any inspectors we do not want to permit to come into this country and inspect. But it does not serve our interest to 
require, put into law a requirement, that certain inspectors be rejected at this early stage because, clearly, that will give them the same ability to reject our inspectors. That is not in our best interest. 
We will have the ability to decide any information that we will exchange with other countries. That has been a confusion about this treaty, Mr. President, that needs to be cleared up. 
When all the debate is concluded at the end of the day today, I believe it serves our national interest to go ahead and ratify the treaty. I believe it will contribute to a more peaceful world. Like all treaties, it lacks perfection. But the acid test is: Will this generation of Americans and future generations of Americans be less likely to confront chemical weapons on the battlefield or in a civilian context if this treaty is ratified? In my view, it is clear that they will be less likely to confront chemical weapons if we go ahead today. I hope very much my colleagues will join in supporting the treaty. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me, first of all, compliment my colleague from Michigan on his excellent statement. I agree with each of his points. It is past time for the Senate to bring this issue to the floor for debate, to debate it seriously, to make whatever modifications or changes or conditions the Senate believes is appropriate, if any, and to get on with ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, one of the challenges in discussing the Chemical Weapons Convention is to figure out how to bring this home to the average American that this is an issue and a concern that is important to them. Many people say, well, this is long term, this is international, this doesn't relate to me right here in River 
City, or Santa Fe, NM, or Silver City, NM, or wherever their hometown happens to be. But, in fact, the convention intends to reduce the likelihood that any of our troops or any American civilians in the future will be injured or killed as a result of chemical weapons. 
The history of the use of chemical weapons is better known by others than by me. My understanding is that the first time there was significant use of chemical weapons was in the First World War. There have been instances since then. We have heard much in the news recently, for example, about the injuries that some of our personnel in the gulf war encountered by virtue of the accidental destruction of Iraqi chemical weapons by some of our own military actions. 
So the issue is real, and the question is, what can we do as a nation? What can we do as a Senate to lessen the risk that chemical weapons will, in fact, injure Americans in the future? I think ratifying this treaty at this time is clearly the most important thing we can do. 
I hope very much that we go ahead and enter a into a unanimous-consent agreement today and begin formal debate of the treaty. We are not in formal debate as of yet because we have been unable to get agreement among all Senators to bring the treaty to the floor. We need to get that agreement and bring it to the floor, and we need to go ahead with the debate. The reason that it is time-sensitive, Mr. President, is that the treaty goes into effect on the 29th of this month. Now, some say it doesn't matter whether we are part of it at the time it goes into effect or whether we are not part of it. They say we can come along later. The problem is that international agreements have been made for the treaty to go into effect. American experts have been working with experts from other countries in putting together protocols and plans for implementing this treaty and the inspections that would be made under the treaty. All of that has been ongoing. If we are not part of the initial group of ratifying nations--it's a very large group; I think 161 nations have signed this treaty. If we are not part of that group when the treaty goes into effect, then the experts from our country that have been involved in establishing protocols and plans for inspection will be excluded from management and inspection teams and others will be put in their place. Perhaps at a later date we could join, but, clearly, it is not in our interest to have an international treaty of this importance begin without us being a part of it. 
I also point out an obvious point, which I am sure has been made many times in this debate. The sanctions called for in this treaty against countries that are not party to the treaty will be imposed on our own chemical companies. Many of the objections that have been raised about the treaty are, in fact, in my view, groundless for the simple reason that our own chemical manufacturers in this country have come out in strong support of the treaty. They want to be part of this. They understand the inspections that will be taking place. They readily subject themselves to those inspections, and they do not want sanctions imposed upon them that keep them from selling chemicals that can be used for chemical weapons, but can also have commercial uses at the same time. They would like to continue to be major participants in the world market in chemicals. They estimate that the loss to our chemical manufacturers could be around $600 million per year if we don't ratify the treaty and if sanctions are imposed on us because we are outside the treaty. 
Mr. President, there are various objections that have been raised. In my opinion, I have never seen a treaty where there has been more effort to accommodate very groundless objections. We have some objections which are not groundless--I will acknowledge that--and concerns that are valid and need to be considered and addressed. We are doing that. But many of the objections that have been raised, in my opinion, are really grasping at straws by people who are trying to find some basis upon which to oppose this treaty. 
The context in which this needs to be considered--this, again, has been said many times here, and I have said it myself--is that we passed a law while President Reagan was in the White House that renounced the use of chemical weapons by this country and which put us on a path to destroy our own chemical weapons capability. President Reagan signed that law. That has been the policy of our Government through the Reagan administration, through the Bush administration, through the Clinton administration, and now into the second Clinton administration. 
We have unilaterally made the decision that we do not need chemical weapons in order to look out for national security concerns. We have many other ways to deal with countries that would use chemical weapons. 
By signing this agreement, by going ahead and ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention, we are not giving up any of the other arrows in our quiver, so to speak. We have the ability to retaliate against the use of chemical weapons in any way we determine to retaliate, whether we are a signatory or not. So we do not lose anything by ratifying it and becoming part of this convention. We gain, however, a substantial amount. For that reason, I think the treaty should go forward. 
Since we have unilaterally decided not to have chemical weapons, not to produce chemical weapons, not to maintain a stockpile of chemical weapons, and not to use chemical weapons in the future, how can it not be in our interest to try to ensure that other countries make that same decision? How can it not be in our interest to join with international inspection groups to investigate and ascertain that the countries that are signatories to this treaty do not in fact violate the convention? 
As I indicated before, our manufacturers agree. If you want to inspect us, come on in. We are glad to have you come in and inspect our plants. We are not going to have chemical weapons, we are not going to stockpile chemical weapons, and, therefore, come on in and investigate us. 
If we ratify this treaty, we can be part of the inspection teams that go to other countries to make the same determination. Some people say, `Well, the problem with it is that not all nations are going to sign onto the treaty.' That is true. Not all nations are. That is very, very true. To deal with that circumstance, the treaty calls for sanctions against those countries that don't ratify the treaty. We cannot enforce the treaty against countries that don't ratify the treaty, but we can impose sanctions upon their ability to purchase or to sell chemicals that have dual use--that can be used in chemical weapons as well as in commercial purposes. That is a significant tool that this convention will give us. 
I do not know of another circumstance--at least in the time I have been here in the Senate--where we have made the unilateral decision to take action that a treaty calls for us to take. For us to now say, `OK, we have already decided to take the actions that the treaty calls for us to take, but we do not know whether we want to go ahead and ratify the treaty so that others also will take those same actions' is nonsensical to me. We need to recognize that in the large scheme of things, this country needs to provide leadership in the world. That leadership includes ratifying this treaty and going forward with putting the protocols for its enforcement in place and participating in the inspection teams required for its implementation. That is exactly what is required. There have been endless negotiations within the Foreign Relations Committee in an effort to accommodate concerns that have been raised. I was not party to those negotiations. I have seen the results of them. Quite frankly, I am amazed at the extent of the conditions that we have agreed should be adopted to allay concerns of different Members. I think that is fine. I have no problem with any of the conditions. I also support whatever is acceptable to the administration, which has primary authority in this area and primary responsibility to enforce the treaty. If they believe these conditions are acceptable, then fine, they are 
acceptable to me as well. But we do need to get on with ratifying the treaty. We need to get on with providing the additional confidence we can to the American public and to assure them that their security concerns are being dealt with responsibly. 
I believe very strongly that this treaty is in the best interest of our country and the best interest of the people of my State. I think it would be a travesty for us to fail to ratify it, and particularly it would be a travesty if we failed to even bring it before the Senate for a vote. That has not happened. I understand the majority leader has worked very diligently to bring that about, and I believe he is on the verge of doing so. I commend him for that. But the reality of the situation is very straightforward--this treaty needs to be ratified. It needs to be ratified soon. The clock is ticking. Our leadership position in the world is at stake, and the security of future generations is also at stake. 
I see that we have both Senators from Massachusetts ready to speak. I do not want to delay them. I ask if either of them wishes to speak on the treaty at this point. 
How much time remains on the treaty?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1997 on behalf of myself, my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, and a bipartisan group of additional Senators. 
This bipartisan measure provides for coverage under part B of the Medicare Program for medical nutrition therapy services by a registered dietitian. Medical nutrition therapy is generally defined as the assessment of patient nutritional status followed by therapy, ranging from diet modification to administration of specialized nutrition therapies such as intravenous or tube feedings. It has proven to be a medically necessary and cost-effective way of treating and controlling many disease entities such as diabetes, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and severe burns. 
Currently, there is no consistent part B coverage policy for medical nutrition and this legislation will bring needed uniformity to the delivery of this important care, as well as save taxpayer money. Coverage for medical nutrition therapy can save money by reducing hospital admissions, shortening hospitals stays, decreasing the number of complications, and reducing the need for physician followup visits. 
The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease account for a full 60 percent of Medicare expenditures. I want to use diabetes as an example for the need for this legislation. There are very few families who are not touched by diabetes. The burden of diabetes is disproportionately high among ethnic minorities in the Unites States. According to the American Journal of Epidemiology, mortality due to diabetes is higher nationwide among blacks than whites. It is higher among American Indians than among any other ethnic group. 
In my State of New Mexico, native Americans are experiencing an epidemic of type II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to their diabetes care. In fact, information from the Indian Health Service shows that medical nutrition therapy provided by professional dietitians results in significant improvements in medical outcomes in people with type II diabetes. For example, complications of diabetes such as end stage renal failure that leads to dialysis can be prevented with adequate intervention. Currently, the number of dialysis patients in the Navajo population is doubling every 5 years. Mr. President, we must place our dollars in the effective, preventive treatment of medical nutrition therapy rather than face the grim reality of having to continue to build new dialysis units. 
Ensuring the solvency of the Medicare part A trust fund is one of the most difficult challenges and one that calls for creative, effective solutions. Coverage for medical nutrition therapy is one important way to help address that challenge. It is exactly the type of cost-effective care we should encourage. It will satisfy two of our most important priorities in Medicare: Providing program savings while maintaining a high level of quality care.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered goes to the heart of a flaw in S. 104. Without the amendment that I am offering, S. 104 will send nuclear waste to the site right next to Yucca Mountain even if Yucca Mountain fails as the geologic repository. We will then have a permanent aboveground repository rather than a geologic repository and will be able to shuffle off the responsibility for dealing with nuclear waste to our children and grandchildren. 
There is an attempt in the bill to disguise this unfair policy with a provision that allows the President to send waste somewhere else if we pass a law to that effect within 24 months. But we are not going to pass a new nuclear waste law in 24 months especially if the reward for not doing so is to keep sending all the waste to Nevada where we can forget about it. 
My amendment stops construction and operation of an interim storage site in Nevada if Yucca Mountain fails as a candidate repository at any time before it opens. If Yucca Mountain is not suitable as a repository, then it is not the right place for interim storage. We must have certainty that our ultimate solution for nuclear waste is based on having a geologic repository and that any action on an interim storage facility rises or falls with the fate of a permanent facility. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the issue of disposal of spent nuclear fuels and high-level radioactive waste has been debated in this Senate in one form or another ever since I arrived here some 14 1/2 years ago. Nuclear waste is a serious issue. It demands serious attention by all Senators. It is a problem that is national in scope. 
It is also a particular responsibility of the Federal Government. After all, it was the Federal Government that proposed, beginning with the Atoms for Peace Program in the Eisenhower administration, to develop the peaceful uses of nuclear power. The problems of disposal of spent nuclear fuel that we face today are the legacy of our past laws and decisions. 
I am not going to characterize the current situation as a crisis. There is too much hype already about disposal of nuclear waste, from all sides of the debate. 
But there are serious problems facing the program that merit attention now, in this Congress. I have an important disagreement with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee about the substitute amendment that is before the Senate today. I believe that it is fatally flawed on two counts, and my amendment is intended to address this fatal flaw. But I also believe that the chairman is right when he says that simply continuing with the current situation is not acceptable. 
Let me point out a number of issues that call out for congressional action at this time. 
First, ratepayers have paid over $8 billion in fees to the nuclear waste fund and earned about $2 billion in interest. Only about $5 billion of this money has been spent on the program. 
Our current budget rules and accounting principles make it nearly impossible to give the program, each year, the appropriations that it deserves. For example, in fiscal year 1996, the President asked for $640 million for the DOE Yucca Mountain Program. Congress appropriated only $315 million--half of the request. As a result, the program had to abandon a comprehensive program plan that was less than 2 years old, and go through yet one more strategic planning exercise to 
figure out how to cope with an inadequate funding base. 
There is no incentive for the President to even make a reasonable budget request at this point. Not surprisingly, the utilities and public utility commissions, who are paying in $600 million each year and seeing only a fraction of that getting spent, are upset with this state of affairs. They have every right to be. 
A second reason why action is required in this Congress is that DOE won't meet its January 31, 1998, deadline to dispose of spent nuclear reactor fuel and is way behind schedule in building a repository. Utilities and ratepayers will have to pay for onsite storage for spent fuel after 1998 in addition to what they would otherwise have needed if DOE had met its 1998 deadline. While many thought that 1998 was unrealistic when it was first picked as a target date, no one thought that we would be missing it by so wide a margin. Some relief is now in order. 
A third problem that needs to be addressed in this Congress is that there will never be a repository if EPA doesn't issue a radiation standard for it. EPA is right in the middle of the critical path for this program, and keeps missing deadline after deadline. 
Part of the blame lies at EPA--it is hard to detect any sense of urgency on their part. But an important part of the blame lies in the inherent difficulty of writing this standard and having it stand up to scrutiny in the courts. Let me remind my colleagues that in 1985, EPA did promulgate a radiation standard for the repository. Two years later, it was stuck down in court. Without some statutory help to clarify issues, I believe that EPA is destined to face the same fate again. 
For example, according to the National Academy of Sciences, there is no technical basis for incorporating human intrusion into a repository standard, because any analysis of human intrusion, in their words, is `driven by unknowable factors.' How will EPA successfully defend a new standard in court, if it has to depend on the unknowable? 
Further, the underlying law governing EPA's development of a repository standard currently places EPA in a legal catch-22. The law requires EPA both to promulgate a dose-based standard and to follow the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences. But the National Academy of Sciences has recommended against promulgating a 
does-based standard. Without additional statutory guidance, how does EPA get out of that box? 
If we sit by and do nothing, we are setting EPA up for certain failure in developing a repository standard over the next few years. 
The final problem that I want to cite which justifies action and leads me to conclude that we need to have action in this Congress is that there is a lawsuit pending against DOE that seeks to escrow the current nuclear waste fee outside the Government. If the court decides that there is liability on DOE's part, there may be other payments for damages that no one can put a price tag on right now. No one can say what the court will do--but it has surprised the Government twice already with its rulings in favor of the utilities. One thing is clear though. There is a sizable potential for major damage, and perhaps fatal damage, to the nuclear waste program over the next 12 months. 
The administration has taken the view that it is premature to consider legislation on this topic at this time, and that Congress should wait until 1999, when the viability assessment of the Yucca Mountain site is complete. 
The list of problems that I have just gone through, and it is far from a complete list, won't age gracefully during the next 2 years. If we don't fix some of them fairly quickly, I believe that we will be wasting a substantial amount of taxpayers' money. I cannot support a same time, next Congress approach to clear and serious difficulties in this program. 
Further, the administration's emphasis on the viability assessment as some sort of touchstone for further congressional action greatly exaggerates the value of the viability assessment. The senior Senator from Nevada has reminded us repeatedly, in this debate, that the viability assessment is not a suitability determination. He is absolutely right. All the scientists involved in the viability assessment agree with him. The viability assessment will not tell us if Yucca Mountain is a good place for a geologic repository. 
The viability assessment will only be useful as a decisionmaking guide if Yucca Mountain is so terrible a site for a repository that even a small amount of scientific data is sufficient to make an overwhelming case that we should give up at that site and look elsewhere. 
If the viability assessment will not tell us much, if anything, about the suitability of Yucca Mountain for a repository, then why is the viability assessment in the critical path for deciding what we should legislate here in this Congress? 
I think the problems facing the Yucca Mountain Program speak for themselves. They will not wait another 2 years to be resolved and neither should we. 
Having agreed with the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee on the need for legislation at this time, let me say that in one important respect I cannot support the proposal he has presented to the Senate. I opposed S. 1936 last year, and I opposed S. 104 this year in its original form when we voted on it in committee. Although the chairman's substitute amendment today is a vast improvement over last year's bill, it still contains fatal flaws that force me to continue to oppose it. 
Before I talk about the fatal flaws in the bill, it is only fair to acknowledge the good-faith cooperation that we have had from the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee in addressing, since the committee's markup, many of the problems that the administration identified in last year's bill. 
The chairman said at the markup that he was open to suggestions as to how to make the bill better and that he wanted to have a constructive dialog, and he meant it. I am glad that I took him at his word for he and his staff have negotiated with me and my staff in very good faith, and anyone who looks at the substitute amendment that is before us today and compares it to the original bill has to admit that, while crucial flaws remain, major progress has been made on a number of topics toward getting a good bill on this topic. 
Almost all the problems that have been aired in the Chamber in this debate and in the veto threat issued by the administration have been addressed in one way or another. 
Mr. President, I would like to describe eight areas in which the chairman proved to be open and flexible to my suggestions for how to improve S. 104 and address major areas of concern raised by the administration and others. 
First, radiation standard. Few provisions of last years nuclear waste bill, S. 1936, and this year's bill, S. 104, have received more criticism than the statutory radiation standard of 100 millirems. Every Member of the Senate has received, over the last week, numerous letters opposing S. 104 from environmental, religious, and public advocacy groups. These letters consistently emphasize the fact that the 100 millirem standard in S.104 is 4 times higher than similar radiation standards for other nuclear facilities. The new radiation standard in the substitute amendment, which is identical to the proposal I offered in the Energy Committee, resolves this issue. It is a risk-based standard that is equivalent to about 25 millirems. It gives statutory expression to the major recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences on every issue except one. The National Academy recommended that the radiation standard be applied at the time of maximum risk, but this is 80,000 to 250,000 years from now. In a licensing proceeding, which is the venue in which any standard will be applied, proving anything with certainty about the world 80,000 years from now--160 times greater than all of recorded history--is a virtual impossibility. So the substitute amendment uses a timeframe for assessing compliance in the licensing proceeding of 10,000 years, the same timeframe that EPA has proposed to use in the past. The substitute also requires a report to Congress from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the predicted compliance of the repository at the time of maximum risk, and delays the effective date of the construction license until Congress has had 90 days to review the commission's report. A similar approach is taken to the question of human intrusion, which the Academy states is `driven by unknowable factors.' I believe that any objective observer would conclude that the radiation standard in the substitute amendment resolves all of the objections that were raised against the old 100 millirem standard. 
Second, NEPA. S. 104 was criticized for running roughshod over the NEPA process. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the licensing procedure for the interim storage facility. NRC regulations require it to prepare an environmental impact statement for any interim storage facility. Yet the time lines in the S. 104, as introduced, would have precluded the commission from carrying out a meaningful EIS. NRC regulations also clearly state that beginning construction of an interim storage facility prior to completion, by the NRC, of its NEPA process is, all by itself, grounds for the commission to refuse to issue such a license. Yet S. 104, as introduced, instructed DOE to start construction as soon as it submits a license application. In committee, I offered an amendment to correct these problems. The substitute amendment adopts my approach. Under the substitute amendment, no construction of an interim storage facility occurs until the NRC has completed the NEPA process called for under its regulations. 
Third, transportation planning. We have heard a lot of discussion about transportation risks in this debate so far. Senator Wyden proposed an amendment that was accepted in the committee's markup that strengthened the provisions of the bill relating to transportation planning. I supported his amendment and he deserves great credit for working closely with his own State of Oregon and with the Western Governors Association, which includes New Mexico as a member, in strengthening the bill in this important area. One goal that he was unable to achieve prior to committee markup was to provide for 3 years of funding and assistance to States and localities, to enable them to be up-to-speed to handle any contingencies related to transportation, no matter how remote their probability. The reason that it was rejected was because it would have conflicted with the headlines in the bill as it stood at that time. After his staff was briefed about progress in my discussions on timing issues, he requested that I explore getting them the third year of training and assistance. Senator Murkowski was agreeable to Senator Wyden's new request, and as a result, every place through which nuclear waste may be shipped will now have 50 percent more training and assistance. I think this is a real improvement. 
Fourth, timing. S. 104 was criticized for its unrealistic deadlines that were virtually impossible to meet. The new deadlines in the substitute amendment are virtually the same as those in the proposal that I offered in committee. They are drawn from the current DOE program plan and from technical discussions by my staff with the actual persons at DOE and the NRC who would be responsible for meeting those deadlines. The resulting deadlines are very realistic, and in some cases have extra scheduling cushion built in. 
Providing enough time for DOE and the NRC to do their work properly has the advantage of postponing construction and operation of an interim storage site in Nevada until after the scheduled record of decision on the permanent repository--September 2000. Under my proposal, which Senator Murkowski agreed to, the interim storage facility license is issued 9 months after DOE has applied for construction authorization 
for the permanent repository. In other words, we don't put the waste on the road to Nevada until well after the time at which DOE has determined, as part of its own NEPA process, that Yucca Mountain is suitable. 
A final advantage of the way my proposal sequences the interim storage facility and the permanent repository is the elimination of much of the competition between the two for financial resources. 
In the period 1999-2001, DOE can concentrate on repository characterization and on putting together a high-quality repository EIS and license application, while the NRC is working on the interim storage facility license application. 
In the period 2002-2005, DOE can concentrate on interim storage facility construction and initial operation while the NRC is reviewing the repository license application. 
Fifth, size of the interim storage facility. In S. 104, as introduced, the capacity of the interim storage facility grows to either 40,000 metric tons of spent fuel in December of 2002, or, if the Secretary is late in submitting a license application for the permanent repository or in opening the repository for operations, 60,000 metric tons of spent fuel. This extra 20,000 metric tons of capacity is added even if the Secretary of Energy does not ask for it or think it is necessary. We accumulated 32,000 metric tons of spent fuel over the last 40 years. I was concerned that an aboveground storage facility that had a capacity of twice today's spent fuel inventory, and a licensing term of 100 years, with indefinite renewals into the 22d and 23d centuries, would be, in reality, more like a permanent aboveground repository, than an interim facility. 
I proposed, and Senator Murkowski accepted, a linkage between the size of the interim storage facility and the status of the permanent repository. Before the permanent repository is in operation, the interim storage facility capacity is limited to just what is needed to get to that date. It is a bridge, not a replacement. A second part of my proposal was to allow the capacity limit of the interim storage facility to grow, only after the repository is licensed to operate by the NRC, and only for the purposes of operating the interim storage facility as an integral part of a total system with the repository. This, too, was accepted. 
The adoption of these changes improve the bill, but only represent a partial success in terms of establishing the correct relationship between the interim storage facility and the permanent repository. My remaining amendment to this substitute amendment is intended to finish the job on getting the right relationship between the two facilities. 
Sixth, preemption. S. 104, as introduced, contained a very worrisome provision preempting all Federal, State, and local laws on the basis of a novel standard of `inconsistent or duplicative.' Removing this preemption provision was a key demand in the administration's veto threat. At my suggestion, we have moved to a preemption provision that restates the status quo in this area of law. The first part of the provision restates the two fundamental Supreme Court rulings on preemption of State requirements by Federal law. Its language is identical to that found in the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act. The second part of the provision is also modeled after the HAZMAT Act. It lists five areas where Congress intends this act to be the last word. Three of the five are modeled after the areas listed in the HAZMAT Act. The other two topic areas for preemption are the land transfer provisions of the Act and the siting and licensing of the repository and interim storage facility. Neither topic breaks new ground. Thus, we have taken a very objectionable provision and removed everything that was objectionable about it. 
Seventh, financing. We have heard a lot, over the last few days, about the problems of S. 104 in terms of how it pays for the nuclear waste program. The junior Senator from Nevada has made some pretty good points about how the bill, as introduced, transfers the burden of paying for the repository from the beneficiaries of nuclear power to the general taxpayer. This issue has been of deep concern to me, as well. Fixing this problem is not easy, as has been evidenced by the fact that we have had additional amendments on this topic during the floor debate. The Nuclear Waste Fund is caught, along with other trust funds, in a trap of budgetary rules and accounting principles that have grown up over the years and that, in cases like this one, yield results that defy common sense. Getting completely out of the trap requires cooperation from either the administration or the Budget Committee, and neither is willing to help. There is a partial solution, though, that puts the program on a sound financial basis outside the current scoring window and that can be implemented for 4 years during the scoring window. This solution has three parts. 
The first part is a fee that is tied to appropriations, to remove the disincentive that now exists to fully fund the program. In the original substitute amendment, there was 
no cap on this fee. Thus, if the Congress were to appropriate $800 million of civilian spending to the program, the fee would rise to about 1.3 mills per kilowatt-hour. I believe that it is appropriate to go over the 1-mill limit, if the ratepayers are getting what they are paying for. 
The second part of the partial solution is a second fee that kicks in if the level appropriated is less than 1 mill per kilowatt-hour. This second fee is set at the difference between the appropriations-based fee and the 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour level. The second fee goes into the nuclear waste fund, to build the needed surplus for the last 40 years of the program. 
The third part of the partial solution is an expedited procedure to approve any recommendation by the Secretary to adjust the 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour level used to calculate the second fee. If we need to be collecting a larger second fee to ensure the integrity of the Nuclear Waste Fund, the Secretary's proposal will make it to the floor for expeditious consideration. 
This agreement, as I originally proposed it, completely answers the concerns raised by the junior Senator from Nevada. Instead of a 1.0 mill per kilowatt-hour cap, we have a floor that the Secretary can propose to raise, to ensure that the funds needed to keep the nuclear waste fund solvent are always there. Instead of transferring liability to the general taxpayer and providing corporate welfare to the nuclear industry, my original proposal ensures that the industry continues to pay its fair share of the costs of the repository. 
Eighth, lawsuit. The last area of agreement that I want to discuss is a commitment to discuss the current lawsuit by the nuclear industry in any conference on the bill. The commitment is in the form of a sense of the Senate that the DOE, the utilities, and the public utility commissions should settle the lawsuit before we enact this bill into law. The idea behind this sense of the Senate language is simple. The utilities and public utility commissions have a two-track strategy to solve their problems. One is legislative. The other is judicial. There is nothing wrong with pursuing both tracks at this time, since it is not clear that the legislative track will produce a public law anytime soon. 
But if the utilities and the public utility commissions do succeed in getting relief from Congress and the President, in the form of nuclear waste legislation that delivers an interim storage facility on a reasonable timeframe and that fixes the nuclear waste fee problem, then the lawsuit against the Federal Government should go away. 
The principle that I believe that the Senate should take to conference, then, is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't get a complete legislative overhaul of the nuclear waste program and then go and try to improve on it, or blow it up, in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. I recognize that we are dealing, in the lawsuit, with vested contractual rights, and that our options to deal with the lawsuit in legislation may ultimately be somewhat limited. But I believe that we should put all parties on notice that the Senate is serious about a cooperative solution to the problem, and that they should be, too. 
Mr. President, I cannot say if the administration thinks that its concerns have been resolved. I am still waiting to hear some definitive statement from the administration on the amendments that we offered in committee a month ago and also a definitive statement on their position with regard to the amendment I am offering today. 
Despite the substantial progress toward making S. 104 a better bill, a key flaw remains in the substitute. It is an issue of the highest importance. It is an issue of whether S. 104, if enacted, would lead to the abandonment of our fundamental policy of geologic storage of nuclear waste in the circumstance where Yucca Mountain would fail as a candidate for a repository. 
This scenario can occur and it does occur in the substitute amendment if the proper relationship between the interim storage facility and the permanent geologic repository is not maintained. 
So what is this proper relationship that I think is so important? The current Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provides for a facility similar to the interim storage facility that is provided for in this bill. In the 1982 act it was called the monitored retrievable storage facility or MRS. We never found a place to put an MRS, but the restrictions on the MRS in current law--which we passed in 1982--are instructive as a guide to how we need to think about such facilities. 
In current law, construction of an MRS cannot begin until the permanent repository has a construction license. In current law, construction of the MRS or acceptance of spent nuclear fuel at the MRS is prohibited during any time in which the repository license is revoked or construction of the repository, that is, the permanent repository, ceases. In current law, the MRS has a capacity limit tied to the opening of the repository. 
These restrictions are all safeguards to prevent the MRS from turning into a de facto permanent above-ground repository. 
In the case of the current bill, we are allowing the interim storage facility to proceed in advance of the licensing of the Yucca Mountain facility, and I agree with that. This is a defensible step in light of the delays in the repository program and the need for such a facility to be in full operation 10 years from now. 
But the decision to allow the interim storage facility to get ahead of the permanent repository makes the issue of safeguards to prevent the interim storage facility from turning into a de facto permanent repository all the more important. 
On the issue of tying the capacity limit of the interim storage facility to the opening of the permanent repository, there is a provision in the substitute amendment that works providing that the substitute also addresses the issue of what happens to the interim storage facility if Yucca Mountain fails to pass muster at some point in the process. And here is where the rub is. The substitute does not address the issue in a complete fashion. 
As I see it, there are four points in the process where Yucca Mountain can fail. There must be clarity on what happens to any interim storage facility in each of those cases. 
The first point in the process is already covered in the bill. It is the viability assessment. As I mentioned earlier, if Yucca Mountain is an absolutely terrible place technically to put a repository, we will probably find out at this stage. The substitute amendment provides that if the President finds, based on the viability assessment, that the Yucca Mountain site is unsuitable for a repository, then he and the Congress have 24 months to find another interim storage facility site or the site in Nevada right next to Yucca Mountain is chosen by operation of law. I will come back to the automatic default to Nevada in just a moment. 
The second point in the process where Yucca Mountain can possibly fail as a candidate repository occurs before the Secretary submits the license application to the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. During the NEPA process for the repository, the Secretary will have to make and defend a suitability determination. If the Secretary determines that Yucca Mountain is unsuitable or cannot meet NRC licensing standards, then, according to the substitute amendment, the Secretary must notify Congress and the State of Nevada to cease all activities at the repository site and report to the Congress within 6 months on the need for additional legislation dealing with nuclear waste. 
What the substitute amendment remains silent on is this question: What happens to the interim storage facility in this case? The Secretary has already submitted a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but no construction has started as yet. In that case, the silence in the substitute amendment means that the Secretary is authorized and in fact is required to go forward in Nevada. In fact, the provisions of the substitute amendment, perhaps unintentionally, turn the interim storage facility into a runaway train. Recall that the statutory limit for the interim storage facility in the substitute is tied to what is needed to get you to the date when the permanent repository opens. If the permanent repository 
suddenly moves 30 years into the future because of a decision that Yucca Mountain is unsuitable, these provisions could be construed as sanctioning moving an extra 90,000 metric tons of spent fuel to Nevada. This is unacceptable. 
The first provision added to the substitute by my amendment would fix this problem. It terminates the Secretary's authority to move forward on an interim storage facility at the site in Nevada if Yucca Mountain fails as a candidate for a permanent repository during the process of making the suitability determination. The Secretary must then make a preliminary designation of one or more alternative sites within the next 24 months. 
The third and fourth points for potential failure of Yucca Mountain as a repository candidate is during the two-step Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process. Suppose that during this process the NRC concludes it is not possible to issue a license for a repository at Yucca Mountain. Under the substitute amendment, the construction and operation of the interim storage facility continue unabated. 
So the second provision added to the substitute by the amendment that I am offering today would try to fix this problem. If Yucca Mountain fails to pass muster at the NRC, then all construction and operation of the interim storage facility is stopped except for safety-related surveillance and maintenance. 
As with the previous case, the Secretary must then make a preliminary designation of one or more sites within the next 24 months and must, in addition, make recommendations to Congress about what to do with the interim storage facility. But in this case, it takes the enactment of another law by Congress to restore any authority to resume construction or resume shipments to the interim storage facility. 
Could there be nuclear waste stored at the interim storage facility at this point? Yes, there could. If the NRC concludes that Yucca Mountain cannot be licensed after the first 20 months of its deliberations on DOE's license application for the repository, then the interim storage facility will contain some amount of spent nuclear fuel. The same situation can also occur under current law. It is possible for the MRS to have its operation suspended because of failure to license a permanent repository after the MRS has received spent nuclear fuel. 
But if you are troubled by the fact that there is a possibility that waste could be shipped to Nevada before the geologic repository is open for shipments, then you are against one of the fundamental premises of this bill; that is, that it is acceptable to provide for an interim storage solution linked to the repository prior to the opening of the repository. Whether or not you think this is acceptable is, of course, for each Senator to decide. If the program were close to a successful opening of the repository today, I would personally be in favor of waiting a few more years. But since the date is now 2010 or potentially beyond that date if we do not fix some of the other problems with the program in this bill, I believe that an interim storage solution is acceptable with the right safeguards. 
In the case of the amendment that I am offering here, one of the safeguards is to face this issue squarely and to make Congress decide what to do and then to enact another law before the Secretary can act. In this way at every stage in the process where Yucca Mountain can fail, my amendment would stop the interim storage facility in its tracks or cancel it outright. 
The probability of Yucca Mountain failing is probably not great, particularly after the suitability determination by the Department of Energy in the year 2000. But that probability is also not zero. The 5-mile tunnel has been dug through the mountain. There is more water inside the mountain than was previously thought to be the case. Maybe this is significant; maybe it is not. There is a second east-west tunnel that will go through the exact area under the western side of the mountain where most of the waste will be placed. The east-west crossing will not occur until after the viability assessment but is critical to the suitability determination. The western slope of the mountain receives more rainfall than the eastern side. Does this mean that there will be even more water under the mountain where the waste will be placed? Enough pause to make the mountain fail as a repository site? No one knows at this point. That is why we are characterizing the mountain in the first place. The ultimate answer will not be known until after the window, in the current substitute amendment, for making a final and irrevocable decision on proceeding with the interim storage facility in Nevada. 
Mr. President, in addition to the problem in the substitute of not permitting us to deal with the failure of Yucca Mountain as a candidate site at any point at which it can occur, there is the problem of the automatic default to Nevada if another site for an interim storage facility is not picked within 24 months. Under the substitute amendment, an interim storage site in Nevada is established regardless of whether the Yucca Mountain site is suitable or not, and the site is changed only if Congress and the President can produce another law providing for an alternative site within 24 months. 
Realistically, Mr. President, passing another nuclear waste law from scratch in 24 months is not going to happen. Consider that we have been working on this bill and its predecessors for substantially longer than that. The nuclear industry spent a great deal lobbying this effort in the last Congress and came up with no solution. 
Does anybody believe that they would make any kind of effort like that if there was an easy answer to their problem, which this bill now provides no matter what happens? So, the provision contained in subsection 204(C)(2) of the bill is fatally flawed on two counts. If Yucca Mountain fails, the practical result is that the waste goes to Nevada, no matter what. 
I do not think that any reasonable person should vote for the substitute amendment with this provision in it. It is not sound policy and it is certainly not fair to the people of Nevada. 
There are lots of ways to ensure that the President acts expeditiously in finding an alternative site and proposing legislation to Congress. The chairman of the Senate Energy Committee has alluded, in previous remarks, to discussions that we have had as to whether a mechanism such as a base closure or realignment commission could develop a set of recommendations that would be forwarded to Congress for action. There are, no doubt, other mechanisms that could work equally well. But I think the principle has to be that any default mechanism we propose has to be workable and has to be fair, if it is actually invoked. I think the scheme in S. 104, the substitute for S. 104, fails on that point. 
I will conclude these remarks by reiterating the basic principles behind the amendment with respect to how interim storage should relate to the permanent repository. First, siting an interim storage facility next to the Yucca Mountain site is acceptable, but--and this is crucial--only as long as that is where the permanent repository is going to be built. 
Second, we should not start construction on an interim storage site in Nevada until Yucca Mountain has passed the suitability determination phase of site characterization. That phase ends with the completion of the environmental impact statement for the repository and issuance of the record of decision. 
Third, if Yucca Mountain is disqualified as a repository site at any point during the process, we should stop any interim storage facility at the site in its tracks. The search for a new interim storage site should then be part of an overall process of looking for a new repository site as well. 
I do not expect my colleagues from Nevada to agree with all these principles. I realize they are implacable in their opposition to the idea of interim storage in Nevada. I oppose the proposition as set forth in the substitute amendment, unless my amendment being offered today is agreed to. But I urge Senators who, like me, would like to have the chance to vote for a good nuclear waste bill, one that has what I think is the right relationship between the two facilities, to support this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me clarify my understanding of the situation. First of all, I agree with much of what was said by the Senator from Alaska. The amendment that I am offering here today does not, in any way, interfere with the end result, as long as the determination is made at every step of the process that the Yucca Mountain site is the appropriate site for a permanent repository of nuclear waste. If that decision is made, then we are in agreement. Then the problem does not exist. It is only if a contrary decision is made that we get into disagreement. 
Let me clarify here that there is a difference in my understanding between the viability assessment, which is due to be completed on December 1, 1998, and the suitability determination, which is due to be completed on October 31 of the year 2000. I agree that as long as Yucca Mountain is a suitable site and that suitability determination is made in the year 2000, then that is the site we ought to go forward with. So we are in agreement there. 
I think the question is, if we want to look at a permanent repository, I think we choose Yucca Mountain, if it is suitable. If it is determined not to be suitable, then the question is, what do we do about an interim facility? 
Now, the only reason for putting an interim facility in Nevada is that that is where the permanent repository is going to be. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board said in its report, `If Yucca Mountain proves suitable for permanent repository development, then the centralized storage facility should be located there as well.' That makes eminent sense to me. Let's have an interim storage facility there, as long as it is decided that we are going to have a permanent repository there. If we decide not to have a permanent repository there, then, in my view, we ought to have the issue come back to Congress, come back to the President to make a decision on what we are going to do. 
The reason I think it is so important that we do that is that I think the end result is a different end result than the Senator from Alaska has in mind. The Senator from Alaska is saying the end result is we have to get this waste out of the present locations at these nuclear powerplants and move it to a central site. That is the end result he is looking for. The end result I am looking for is that we need to have geologic storage, permanent storage, of this waste. In my view, my amendment has a much greater chance of getting us to geologic permanent storage of this waste than his solution does. 
His solution says that, regardless of what we decide about Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository, we are going to put the waste in Nevada in this interim site, and that's going to happen. There is no way to wiggle out of that. Once the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site is determined, we are going to put the waste in Nevada. It is going to be on an interim site there, and there is no way to wiggle out. So we have accomplished our end result. 
My view is that, fine, we moved the waste to Nevada, but it is on a slab of cement out in the middle of the desert. It is not in geologic storage, not in safe storage, not in permanent storage. Therefore, we have not solved the problem that we set out to solve for all these many decades with regard to nuclear waste. The only way to get us to a geologic repository for that waste, a permanent repository for that waste, if the Yucca Mountain proves unsuitable, is to bring it back to Congress and the President and say, `Choose another permanent repository for this waste.' That is what is going to have to happen. That is what ought to have to happen. At that time, we also can decide what to do about an interim site. 
But it makes no sense to me to be saying, look, if we decide Yucca Mountain is not suitable, we decide we can't put the waste there in a permanent repository, we are still going to put all the waste there; we are going to put it in a central repository, and it is going to be in Nevada because we earlier said it was going to be in Nevada. Granted, the only reason we said that is because we are going to have a permanent repository there. Now we have decided if we can't have a permanent repository there, we can still put the waste there and get it out of these other States. I don't think that is fair to Nevada. I don't think it is good public policy. So I say let's keep the two issues tied together. Let's say, if the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada is determined not to be a suitable facility, if we decide that that site, Yucca Mountain, is not a suitable site for a permanent repository, then we need to put the brakes on with regard to using this interim facility in Nevada and say, wait a minute, we have to pick another permanent repository. Let's also make a decision about an appropriate interim storage site. 
So that's the difference that we have. I think it is a good-faith difference. The great failing that I see with the substitute the way it now stands is that if Yucca Mountain is determined not to be an appropriate permanent repository, then all of the pressures, the course of least resistance will be to move the waste to an interim site in Nevada, put it on a cement slab out in the middle of the desert. That will be the end of it. The pressure will be off. Congress will be under no obligation to do anything else. The President will be under no obligation to do anything else. The only people who will suffer, or potentially suffer, from this are the people of Nevada. I think that is not a responsible public policy position for us to take. We need to find another permanent repository if Yucca Mountain proves not to be the right permanent repository. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the outstanding achievements of the `Top 25' women-owned businesses in New Mexico that are being honored by Albuquerque Woman magazine. These businesses--small-, medium-, and large-sized--are all contributing to the economic well-being of our State. 
It is not easy to start up a new business venture, and it is even more difficult to become a prosperous enterprise. Economic success requires the dedication, hard work and know how that all of the winners of the `Top 25' awards have shown. But successful businesses operated by caring individuals generate more than economic growth, they also build our communities. If you look at the list of the businessowners that I will include later in my statement, you will notice many familiar names. These names are familiar because these women are contributing their energy and insight to improving our communities in New Mexico every day. 
We face many challenges in my home State of New Mexico, not the least of which is to create jobs that pay good wages and provide retirement security. The contributions these women businessowners have made represent real progress in building both the human and capital infrastructure of private enterprise in New Mexico. I congratulate them on their accomplishments and wish them well on the further growth of their businesses. 
The list of those businessowners being honored by Albuquerque Woman magazine are: Teresa McBride, Jo Summers, Dorothy Queen, Melissa Deaver, Barbara Trythall, Kathleen Olson, Shirley Jones, Judy Roberts, Carole Petranovich, Sandra Bundy, Judi Friday, several doctors from Women's Specialists of New Mexico Ltd., Ching-Ching Ganley, Caroline Roberts, Laurie Steinberg, Elizabeth Pohl, Joan Rosley-Griffin, Ella Leeper, Mary Severns, Sandra Levinson, Annique Torres, Brenda Kilmer, Sally C. Olinger, Jan Pfeiffer, and Renee Budagher.

<TEXT>
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in order to describe what this amendment does, let me first just give my colleagues the context, the way this bill is structured so they understand what we are talking about here. 
Under this bill, the way it is pending before us, we have the Secretary of Energy proceeding to go forward and study and analyze the appropriateness of using the Yucca Mountain site as a permanent repository and doing what is called the viability assessment to decide whether Yucca Mountain is going to be the right site, or an appropriate site. 
If the Department of Energy, the Secretary of Energy, advises the President and the President determines that Yucca Mountain is not a proper site, then at that point we go to plan B, and plan B says that the President then has 18 months in which to choose another interim site for the waste except that under the bill the way it now stands after the last amendment and previous amendments that were adopted, he can choose another site with some exceptions. 
The exceptions are, first, the President shall not designate the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington as a site for the construction of an interim storage facility. The second exception is that he shall not designate the Savannah River site and any of Barnwell County in the State of South Carolina. And, of course, we just adopted an amendment saying that he shall not designate the Oak Ridge reservation in the State of Tennessee. 
Mr. President, what this amendment does that I am offering right now is say let us strike those exceptions. If in fact the President determines that Yucca Mountain is not the right site for a permanent repository, then we ought to all be in this thing together and the Secretary and the President should have full discretion to designate whatever site they want. Otherwise, Mr. President, I as a Senator from New Mexico have to answer the question from my constituents, why didn't I stand up and get some exceptions added for New Mexico. 
For example, everyone in my State knows that we have a nuclear waste site being constructed in New Mexico and not too far from being opened, the WIPP site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plan. Why didn't I stand up and offer an amendment to exclude the WIPP site? That would be a very logical thing to do. 
If I were representing Colorado, I think the citizens of Colorado would have a very legitimate question that they could put to me: Why didn't you, Senator, stand up and move to exclude Rocky Flats? That is a contaminated site, just as contaminated as Hanford, just as contaminated as Savannah River. Rocky Flats certainly should be on the list of excluded sites. 
If I was representing Idaho, why haven't I excluded the Idaho site? There is great concern in the State of Idaho about the possibility of nuclear waste remaining in that State. Ohio, the mound site. There has been a lot of concern about contamination of the mound site. How could a Senator representing the good people of Ohio explain to them why that site was not also excluded? What about Florida? We have the Pinellas site there which was a manufacturing site for components for nuclear weapons. Why haven't we excluded that site? 
I would ask how any Senator here could stand and explain to their constituents why we have not excluded all Superfund sites. Superfund sites would be very logical sites for the President to choose as an alternative to this Nevada site if in fact the President has to make that determination. 
What about shutdown military bases. Why shouldn't we exclude them? There is a real danger in many of our States--we have been fortunate in New Mexico. None of our military bases have been shut down, but there are many States in the country where military bases have been shut down. If I was representing one of those States, I would want to be sure that shutdown military bases were not on the list that the President could choose from. 
So, I think I have made the point fairly clear that it is very hard for me to explain to people in my State why I am opposed to putting waste in Tennessee, I am opposed to putting waste in South Carolina, I am opposed to putting waste in Washington State, but I do not mind putting it in our State. That is a very difficult argument to make. 
So my amendment would say, look, let us eliminate the exceptions. Let us recognize that there is a certain amount of risk involved in the legislation we are passing. The risk says if we determine, if the President determines, down the road that Yucca Mountain is not to be chosen, then we are all in this thing together and everyone is in the barrel. We cannot just say this State is out, that State is out, the other State is out, and the other 47 are in the barrel. 
I think that is only reasonable. I know we have a lot of so-called NIMBY amendments around the Congress--`not in my backyard' is a NIMBY amendment. We have three NIMBY amendments stuck in this bill so far. I am just wondering why we do not have 47 additional ones stuck in here so we can exclude all 50 States, if we are going to exclude 3. So my amendment would say let us eliminate the three that are there. If we are going to go down this road, if we are going to adopt this bill, if we are going to give the President discretion to choose an alternative site, let us give him discretion to choose an alternative site wherever he determines or she determines it makes sense to put this waste. 
That is the sum and substance of the amendment. To me it is straightforward. It is good government. It is good politics for any of us who represent States other than the three that are now excluded. I hope very much my colleagues will support the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me respond. I certainly agree with the Chairman's point that these Senators are greatly concerned about these sites in their States. I compliment them for proposing and being able to get these amendments that they have gotten into this bill into the bill. I think they have done very good work in representing their States' interests. My point is that there are many other sites in this country which have an equal or perhaps an even greater claim to being excluded. We need to either put those sites in or take these sites out. That is the simple thrust of my amendment. 
Much of the waste that is concerning people at Savannah River, Oak Ridge, and Hanford--some of that waste will wind up in my State and not on an interim basis. Under the proposal for the WIPP site, that is a permanent repository for transuranic defense-related waste. These Senators are providing that they will not have to take any additional interim waste, and the plans are that much of the waste that they are now complaining about having been put in their States will in fact travel to my State of New Mexico in the future once the WIPP site is open. So I have great difficulty agreeing with them that their States should be excluded from possible consideration as a future interim site while my State should be included. 
As I say, I would feel the same way if I were representing Rocky Flats in Colorado, if I were representing Ohio, the mound site there, or if I were representing the Pinellas shutdown facility in Florida. And, of course, as all of us know, there are a great many Superfund sites around the country which have been determined to be contaminated. I think all of those sites would be at great risk of being chosen by the President and therefore they, their Senators, would want to stand up and get their States or their sites excluded as well. 
Mr. President, I think this is a very difficult issue, where you put nuclear waste. But the only way I know to get from here to there, to a reasonable result, is to say we are all going to have to share the risk. That is what my amendment would try to do. 
I yield the floor. I ask, is there additional time on my side?

I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Oregon and his concern for the Pacific Northwest. I compliment him on getting this provision in the bill. I will only make the point that I represent the desert Southwest, not the Pacific Northwest. And just as the Pacific Northwest ought to be excluded, so should the desert Southwest. Therefore, I suggest we have a level playing field and not exclude anyone. We all ought to be in this barrel together.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. The bill, as it now stands before us, says that the Department of Energy will go ahead and try to determine whether it can use the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada for a permanent repository. 
Mr. President, the Department of Energy will go ahead and try to determine if it can use the Yucca Mountain site. If the President decides, before the deadline in here, in 1999, that Yucca Mountain is not an appropriate site, then they cannot proceed with Yucca Mountain anymore. 
The President is given 18 months to find another interim site for this nuclear waste, except that the President--and this is in the bill now--it says: The President shall not designate Hanford Nuclear Reservation in the State of Washington and the Savannah River site in Barnwell County in the State of South Carolina or the Oak Ridge Reservation in the State of Tennessee as a site for construction of an interim storage facility. 
Mr. President, what I am saying is, let us strike those exemptions. All of our States, all of our sites, ought to be at risk if we decide to go this route.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the Surface Transportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act. As I do, Mr. President, I want to emphasize my belief that the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], has in large part been a great success for our Nation. ISTEA has been a revolutionary effort to distribute transportation funding to assist States in major highway, bridge, environmental, research, and safety projects. After 6 years, however, we have learned that there are areas of ISTEA in which we can make significant improvement. STARS 2000 is the best mechanism so far by which we can do that. 
I am cosponsoring STARS 2000 because it reemphasizes the national interest in a national transportation system. Mr. President, each State is a vital part of the national system; without one part the whole system fails. The highway system in New Mexico for instance, serves not just its resident and industrial traffic needs, but its highways also serve as a vital link for commerce between the Pacific coast and the eastern seaboard, and between Mexico and Canada. The system of highways crossing New Mexico is also crucial for the movement of manpower, equipment, and supplies in support of our Nation's defense. STARS 2000 offers a balanced, sensible approach so that all the States continue to play a central role to the overriding national goals. 
Just as importantly, STARS 2000 effectively addresses the unique character of western, rural States and their importance to our national system of highway. New Mexico, for example, has only six-tenths of 1 percent of the total U.S. population. However, it must maintain 2 percent, 3,000 miles, of the National Highway System. Many people do not realize that road travel takes on a different meaning in the West. For instance, a trip from Farmington, NM, to Hobbs, NM, is 513 miles, and there are few options other than driving to make that tip. By contrast, that same distance would take you from Washington, DC, to Detroit, MI. 
STARTS 2000 also builds on the successes of ISTEA. For instance, the Surface Transportation Program maintains Federal support for the bride replacement and rehabilitation program. STARS 2000 also maintains support for Federal lands roads, a program that is vital to States in the West where a vast majority of our Nation's Federal lands are located. Forty percent of New Mexico, for example, is Federal land. STARS 2000 eliminates the old system that penalizes a State for using Federal funds on roads located on Federal lands and Indian reservations. This is a step in the right direction and it is desperately needed in the West. I am concerned that STARS proposes only level funding for the Indian reservation road program. Although I am supporting S. 437, the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act, I will continue to try to increase funding for roads and bridges on Indian reservations. 
STARS 2000 also includes a program that addresses congestion management and air quality. I am concerned, however, with the degree to which resources for this activity have been cut and the fact that it is eliminated as a separate category within STARS. CMAQ has been a significant reason cities like Albuquerque have attained and are maintaining clear air standards, and I hope we will find ways to keep this program working. 
Additionally, STARS 2000 addresses the need to maintain our Nation's current system of roads and bridges. Unless the current system is sufficiently maintained, we will inevitably have to spend many more dollars to rebuild the system, something we can ill-afford. In New Mexico, like most other States, maintenance costs overwhelm the State's total highway budget. To its credit, New Mexico applies much of its highway funding to maintenance. Nevertheless, if the entire New Mexico road budget were applied to maintenance alone, only 7,500 of the State's 11,600 miles of highways could be adequately maintained. As many as 5,800 miles of New Mexico's roads have deteriorated to the point that they must be replaced at a cost of $1.15 million per mile. As a result, New Mexico, like most other States in the West, is unable to fund other critical transportation objects. 
As we continue to recommit ourselves to maintaining and improving our Nation's transportation system, let me say that it is also incumbent upon the individual States to share in this ever-increasing responsibility. Clearly, there is a strong national transportation interest, but the States must recognize its own obligations. We are doing our part at the Federal level, and States must do the same. 
Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I commend my esteemed colleagues, Senators Baucus, Kempthorne, and Thomas, for working diligently to assemble this legislation. I believe that STARS is a measure that will eventually lead to a better, more efficient transportation system in our country and ultimately a stronger economy.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the achievements of the students and educators at West Mesa High School in Albuquerque, NM, and especially its growing Advanced Placement [AP] program. 
On Tuesday, April 1, I had the opportunity to visit West Mesa and speak with students and teachers participating in the school's AP program. Several State legislators and business leaders joined me in a short but invaluable group discussion and class visit. 
Perhaps most impressive was the visit to one of Mr. Tomas Fernandez' AP English classes, where students explained in their own words why AP courses are so important. In this class, the students don't ask for less home work or `dumbed-down' classes; they are demanding more challenging classes and higher academic expectations for all students. While AP classes are new to many, and set a very high standard, the students had found that they could succeed. 
Principal Milton Baca and a growing number of West Mesa teachers are responding to this demand by providing more and more challenging classes in the school's growing AP program. For example, West Mesa recently added an AP Calculus course in addition to its AP English course, and five teachers attended AP teacher training institutes last summer. More teachers are planning to attend AP training courses this summer so they can start an AP science course in the next school year. I applaud all of these efforts. 
For college-bound students, taking AP courses and passing AP exams can translate into valuable college credits for advanced high school work. For those AP students who decide not to go to college, they and their prospective employers can be confident that they are better prepared academically and will have an advantage as they compete for jobs and enter the work force. 
Because AP programs are so beneficial to both work- and college-bound students, I have been working on efforts to expand these programs, as part of the solution to our State's clear need for immediate, measurable education reform. To show the importance of strong academic skills to employers, I am working with several businesses in New Mexico to develop employment incentives for students who take and pass AP exams, especially in the core academic areas of English, math, and science. In addition, I am gratified that the State legislature increased funding for the AP New Mexico program to $200,000 next year, as I requested in testimony before the relevant committees. 
Despite this important progress, West Mesa High School and New Mexico have a long way to go to more fully utilize the AP program as a way to challenge high school students, raise academic achievement to higher levels, and improve our long-term economic productivity. In New Mexico, roughly 5,000 students took AP classes in 1996--up 22 percent from 2 years ago--with a 20-percent increase in AP tests taken, but this is still below the national average. New Mexico's per-capita participation rate remains 20 percent lower than Arizona's and 40 percent below the national average. 
We are facing an uphill struggle to improve our schools and students' academic performance in several areas, including making better use of the AP program. But the strides that West Mesa High School is making are compelling evidence that we can make real and lasting positive change in our schools. I congratulate West Mesa's students and teachers on their accomplishments so far, wish them well on further advancement, and offer my assistance as they continue to improve.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the statement that the Senator from North Dakota made a little earlier in the proceedings about the importance of us getting on to a vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. I believe very firmly that this is an issue which has been hanging around the Senate for too long. We have had many--in fact, years of consideration. We have had, I believe, 14 hearings now on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The convention was supported, of course, by the previous administration. President Bush signed the agreement. We need now in this administration, the second Clinton administration, to go ahead and ratify it. There is an important date coming up which is the 29th of April, which is the date by which we need to take action. Let me address that issue first, because I know the Senator from Oklahoma did speak to the fact that, in his opinion, April 29 was not a date of any consequence and it did not matter whether we did anything this month or not on the treaty. This is sort of a recent argument that has been made and one I think needs to be responded to. 
A failure to ratify by April 29 will have significant adverse consequences for our security and for U.S. businesses as well. Our ability to oversee the first critical days and months of implementation of the treaty will be lost. We now have Americans who are heading up the various divisions that monitor the treaty's budget and security measures and industry inspections, and those individuals, those Americans who now are involved in that will be replaced by individuals from countries that have ratified the treaty if we do not take action by the 29th of April. 
Moreover, Americans will not be able to be hired as inspectors with these international teams if we do not ratify the treaty. Hundreds of millions of dollars in sales of American chemical companies and many jobs in many of our States will be at risk as a result of mandatory trade restrictions which were originally designed to pressure rogue states to join in the treaty. Those will be applied to us, Mr. President, if we do not go ahead and vote and ratify this treaty. 
Failure to ratify, of course, relegates us to the so-called international pariahs that we give a lot of speeches about here on the Senate floor, countries like Libya and North Korea. We would be squandering U.S. international leadership in the fight against chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. 
There have been many speeches given on the floor and by our President about how the United States, at this particular point in history, is the indispensable Nation. We are the one remaining superpower in the world, both militarily and economically and, as such, we have a particular responsibility to lead. Our failure to take action on this treaty on the Senate floor is an abrogation or default of that responsibility and one I think that I do not want to be any party to. 
Another issue that has been raised, which I think needs to be addressed, is this issue which involves the question of whether or not the Chemical Weapons Convention could be interpreted as providing rogue states with the ability to acquire advanced U.S. technologies if we enter into this treaty. The issue was raised at the Armed Services Committee hearing that we had a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the Senator from Oklahoma was there and requested that we get some kind of statement from our Department of Defense in writing about their view of this.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this letter goes into great detail about why there is no provision in the treaty and there is nothing in the treaty that our Department of Defense would interpret as putting an obligation on us to provide sensitive technologies to rogue states: 
Senator Inhofe raised a particular concern regarding Paragraph 3 of Article X. This paragraph states that `Each Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, material and scientific and technological information concerning the means of protection against chemical weapons.' 
The letter goes on to say: 
The inclusion of the words `facilitate' and `possible' underscores that no specific exchange is required and that any exchange which does occur is limited to that which we determine would be appropriate and permitted under the Convention. 
I think it is clear from this analysis that our own Department of Defense feels very comfortable with the provisions of this Chemical Weapons Convention. 
The overriding context that this convention is presented to us in has to be considered, Mr. President, whenever you are debating the chemical weapons treaty or the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Sometime over a decade ago, the United States made a decision to terminate the use of chemical weapons and, in fact, to destroy our stockpile of chemical weapons. President Reagan signed the law to do just that. In accordance with that, President Bush came along, after President Reagan, and went ahead and carried out that policy and entered into the Chemical Weapons Convention on behalf of the country and sent the treaty to the Senate for consideration. It has been languishing here ever since President Bush sent it here for consideration. 
I think that we would have a very different debate and you would have a very different lineup of people on different sides of this issue--and, frankly, you would have many more people in opposition to this treaty--if, in fact, we had not made a decision and put in our own law a provision to renounce the use of chemical weapons. But we did. We made that decision. President Reagan signed that law. 
And now for people to come to the floor and say, no, no, we are going to be putting ourselves at some kind of disadvantage if we enter into a treaty with 161 other countries which would subject them to the same kind of policy decision which we already made some decade ago, just has no logic to it. 
Clearly, there are problems in verifying this treaty. There are problems in verifying any treaty. They are probably complicated when it comes to verifying a treaty to ban chemical weapons because it takes such a small amount of technology and such a small amount of space to produce chemical weapons. But that does not mean that we should just give up on any and all efforts to verify and any and all efforts to inspect. 
I think Madeleine Albright, our Secretary of State, made the point very well in a statement she made yesterday where she said, just because there may be people--and there are people--who will continue to murder and pillage and sell drugs, does not mean we should not pass laws to prohibit that. We should pass those laws. We should do our very best to enforce those laws and implement them. That is true with chemical weapons as well. 
There may be people--and there undoubtedly will be--some rogue states and some individual groups, terrorist groups, that try to violate this treaty. All I can say is, we need to redouble our efforts to enforce the treaty once we ratify it. We need to work with other countries to gain their assistance in doing that enforcement. 
Clearly, it is in the best interest of the people of this country that we take every action we possibly can to reduce the likelihood that chemical weapons will ever be used against Americans in future conflicts or in a nonconflict situation. Perhaps the biggest threat that we face is not in the use of chemical weapons in a conflict. The biggest threat may be the kind of an incident that occurred in Japan in a subway where a terrorist group decides that for some perverted reason they are going to engage in the use of chemical weapons. This treaty will help us to ferret out those kinds of incidents, those kinds of risks and to deal with them ahead of time. I think it is clearly in our best interest to do so. 
Mr. President, let me just say that I have confidence that the Senate, if allowed to vote on this issue, will vote by the necessary supermajority to go ahead and pass the treaty and ratify the treaty. What we are up against now is an inability to get the treaty to the floor for a vote. And that, I think, is a very sad procedural circumstance that we have. We have a committee chair who has announced that he may or may not allow this issue to be reported from the committee so that the full Senate can express its will on the subject. 
Mr. President, I hope very much that my colleagues will join me in seeing to it that we do get this issue to the floor, and that we go ahead and vote on the treaty. If a Senator wants to vote against the Chemical Weapons Convention and go home and explain to his or her constituents why they voted against the Chemical Weapons Convention, then fine. That is the way the system is supposed to work. 
But for us to deny Members the right to vote is really indefensible, in my view, on an issue of this importance. This is tremendously important. I have urged, as several Members know, the Democratic leader, and indicated to the majority leader that I thought it was irresponsible for the Senate to continue doing business as usual while this issue continues to languish in committee. 
The deadline is approaching. This is time sensitive. We need to go ahead and get the issue to the floor and allow a good debate, allow amendments, and allow a vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I think that needs to be our top priority this April. And we are still early enough in the month that we can bring this to the floor, debate it, vote on it, and let the Senate do its will. The American people have a right to expect that from us. And clearly we need to go ahead and follow that course of action. 
I think for us to continue with discussions about: Well, it does not really matter whether we sign up now or sign up in June or maybe July or maybe this fall some time, that is not accurate, Mr. President. It does matter. And we will be giving up a leadership role that we should have on arms control issues. We will be giving up a leadership role we should have on the banning of chemical weapons. Clearly, I think that is contrary to the best interests of the people I represent and contrary to the best interests of the American people generally. 
Mr. President, I urge the majority leader and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put aside other business, and bring this issue to the floor. Let us vote on it. Let us have a debate. Anyone who wants to offer an amendment should be able to do that. Anyone who wants to offer implementing legislation should be able to do that. The Senate should vote on it, and then get about other business. So I hope that is the course we follow. 
Mr. President, I know there will be additional chances this afternoon and later on to debate this issue in more depth. I look forward to those. I believe very firmly that this is one of the most important issues this Congress, this 105th Congress, will address. I hope very much that we will clear the other procedural matters and the other substantive matters that are on the agenda and get on to a vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Mr. President, with that I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, without objecting, I would like to ask a question of the majority leader before proceeding or determining whether to object. 
As the majority leader and the Democratic leader both know, I have been very concerned that we get some agreements or understanding about how the Chemical Weapons Convention is to be handled in April. We have a deadline coming at us. I think the convention, as I understand it, goes into effect on the 29th of April. We have to, if the United States is to participate, if the judgment of the Senate is we should participate in that, we would have to make that judgment several days before that. At least that is what I have been informed. 
I am just concerned that time is running out. We seem to be taking one legislative or executive matter up after another here without really having an understanding about how we are going to dispose of this Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I wondered if the majority leader could assure me about how this is going to be brought to the Senate and dealt with in the coming month?

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me just respond by saying I appreciate the statements by the majority leader. I have observed the majority leader here for several months, and I have great confidence that when he expects and intends for a particular matter to come to the Senate floor and be dealt with, that that will actually occur, and I am encouraged by his statements to that affect. On that basis, I will not object to this particular unanimous-consent request. 
I will plan to renew my concern once we return from this recess if it is not clear at that time that we have all parties in agreement as to the timing to bring that convention to the floor. I think timing is essential. 
I have no problem with amendments and changes. I am not trying to dictate the end result on what the Senate does, but I think it is very important that we vote on it in a timely fashion. I take the statement by the majority leader to be a statement that he intends and expects that we will work assiduously to bring that about. I thank the majority leader. 
I do not object.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I just wanted to also comment on this issue and state that I think we are to the point where it is not responsible for the Senate to go on with its other business if we cannot get agreement among Senators to bring up this very important matter on a timely basis. I think clearly we can do other work while we wait for the time certain to bring up the Chemical Weapons Convention, but if we cannot get agreement to bring it up, then I do not think it is responsible for us to go ahead and proceed with business as usual. 
Unfortunately, under the rules of the Senate, the only option available to those of us in the minority is to insist that this issue, which is time sensitive, be given attention by the Senate or at least get scheduled for attention by the Senate before we proceed to other matters, and I would expect to do that in the future. I do think the majority leader is trying to move ahead with this, but evidently there are objections being raised by others. I do not question that amendments will be offered. I do not question that real issues will be raised about different portions of the treaty. That is what we are designated to do under the Constitution, to debate those issues and vote on them. We do have a responsibility, though, to have a final vote on this treaty in a timely fashion, and I think until we can get agreement to do that, it is very difficult to proceed with business as usual. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act of 1997. This is an act that is long overdue. It would ensure that the native American communities in our country received the necessary funding to keep up with their growing infrastructure needs, in this case, roads. This bill would also ensure that we continue the Federal responsibility and commitment to native Americans. In addition, Mr. President, the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act would go a long way toward providing native American communities the necessary means toward economic and rural development to attract more business enterprises, tourism and thereby, job creation. 
As my distinguished colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has aptly described today, Indian tribes and Alaskan communities must maintain over 50,000 miles of roadways. Many of our Nation's bridges and roadways are in great need of repair and upgrade, and tribal roads and bridges are by no means an exception. This year as we work toward ISTEA reauthorization, we must address many complicated issues. For example, we must determine whether and to what extent distribution formulas should be adjusted, whether to provide States added flexibility in administering programs, and whether and to what extent current environmental protections should be enhanced. 
But as we toil to address these issues, we must realize that tribal communities are facing and must address transportation issues just as challenging as those we address on a State and national Level. Tribes have the same needs and are just as interested as our Nation's urban dwellers in improving roads and bridges. Tribal communities are interested in establishing and maintaining mass transit systems especially to assist their elderly, disabled, and youth get to and from places for goods, services, health care, and after-school activities. 
Mr. President, our investment in city, State, county, and tribal transportation systems is an investment from which we will certainly reap larger economic benefits and a much greater quality of life for communities greatly in need of help.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the President's nomination of Federico PenAE6a as Secretary of Energy. He comes before the Senate today with 4 years of experience as Secretary of Transportation. This experience will stand him in good stead in his new position since the Department of Transportation has a number of features that are in common with the Department of Energy. 
Both agencies were formed by fusing organizational elements taken from various other departments and agencies. 
Both agencies currently have responsibility for a wide range of divergent issues and programs, and in recent years both agencies have had to square the desires of their traditional core constituencies with new environmental considerations and sensitivities. 
Only two of Secretary PenAE6a's predecessors, James Schlesinger and James Watkins, were able to come before the Senate at the time of their nomination with comparable credentials as managers of large and complex Federal organizations. The Department of Transportation's budget is more than $30 billion, nearly twice the budget of the Department of Energy. It employs nearly 100,000 Federal employees compared to the 20,000 employed at the Department of Energy. 
Secretary-designate PenAE6a has faced some important challenges as Secretary of Transportation. He will face even more important challenges as Secretary of Energy. 
As the first order of business, he will need to develop a close working relationship with the Department of Defense. Cooperation with the Department of Defense is essential to the success of the Department of Energy in carrying out its national security missions. His track record at the Department of Transportation is very encouraging in this respect. Secretary PenAE6a went out of his way while at the Department of Transportation to establish constructive partnerships with the Department of Defense on issues of mutual concern, such as shipbuilding technology. He also worked closely and successfully with DOD on commercialization of global positioning satellite systems. 
A second major challenge for the new Secretary is to preserve and enhance the research and development capabilities of the Department. Our nominee's track record at the Department of Transportation is also impressive in this area. Under Secretary PenAE6a's leadership, the Department of Transportation posted a 60-percent increase in research and development spending, with substantial growth in nearly every part of the Department. Few Federal agencies over the last 4 years can make the same claim. 
Secretary PenAE6a also reorganized and improved the coordination of the Department of Transportation research and development programs, establishing joint program offices cutting across internal departmental boundaries. I am looking forward to Secretary PenAE6a's strong leadership in this area in the future. 
A final challenge facing Secretary-designate PenAE6a will be to carry out the Department's missions in an environmentally responsible manner. The Department of Energy lost public trust and credibility in some previous years by pursuing its programs without sufficient regard to human and environmental consequences and to the need for public participation in decisionmaking. Recovering that public trust has been a slow and difficult process. It is essential to maintain momentum in this direction if the Department is to regain that public trust. Secretary PenAE6a has a track record here that augers well. 
At the same time that he accelerated progress at the Department of Transportation on the construction of new highways and transportation projects, he also increased the speed of the Department of Transportation's response to natural disasters and he brought new emphasis to environmental considerations in transportation management planning. 
Mr. President, the Senate's action on this nomination is long overdue. It should have occurred a month ago. The committee's delay in bringing the nomination to the floor, as the chairman of the committee has said, had nothing to do with Secretary PenAE6a's integrity or qualifications for the job. The delay resulted from Senators trying to hold his nomination hostage to attempt to persuade the President to change his position on nuclear waste legislation. 
The President has stated serious and well-founded concerns about the nuclear waste bill which is being marked up in the Energy Committee today and the effect that bill would have on the long-term solution to the nuclear waste problem. I share many of those concerns, as do other Senators. To his credit, the President has not been bullied into changing his mind on the substance of that bill, but he has agreed that Secretary PenAE6a, once confirmed, can work with those of us in Congress to try to find a solution to this very difficult and complex problem. 
Ironically, we are going forward today in the Energy Committee to mark up the nuclear waste bill. This is at a time, of course, before Secretary PenAE6a will be sworn into office and before he will have had a chance to work with us to resolve some of the differences which have arisen with regard to this legislation. 
I believe Secretary PenAE6a will be a great Secretary of Energy. I hope we will confirm him today. I am looking forward to working with him on all the important issues--national security, energy policy, environmental protection and technological competitiveness, and I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.

<TEXT>
Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to comment about the balanced budget amendment on which we will be voting today. 
I came to the Senate in January 1983, at a point in time when the Federal Government was making terribly unwise choices about spending and revenues. Our budget deficits were off the charts during these Reagan years, and I felt that the very foundation of sound fiscal policy was being undermined. These were the years when we needed to have more serious debate about bringing spending under control--and when we needed to at least consider a more serious response such as amending the Constitution to require balanced budgets. 
We have a very different situation today. During the last 4 years, the budget deficit has declined remarkably. Tough choices are being made about spending and revenue which are bringing the deficit down to levels thought unimaginable only a few years ago. And today we nearly have unanimous bipartisan support to bring the budget into balance by 2002. The Nation's budget deficit, as a percentage of gross national product, is the smallest it has been in decades and the least of all the great industrial powers. 
The difference between today and 14 years ago is that we are clearly moving strongly in the right direction, not through amendments to our Nation's most important legal document, but by debating our national priorities and making our spending better reflect those priorities. 
I believe in balancing the budget, but sound fiscal management demands that such balance be achieved by responsible choices that reflect our values--helping those in need, promoting long-term infrastructure investment, and promoting high-wage job growth in our Nation. Those who have doggedly pursued this amendment to the Constitution did not do so when the budget imbalances were growing by great leaps during the Reagan administration; a balanced budget was not their concern. But cutting taxes on those who are best off is one of their primary concerns--and it was in part the spending profligacy of the early Reagan years combined with the ill-considered and regressive Kemp-Roth tax cut that created the enormous deficits we are financing today. We are actually spending less today than the Treasury is taking in--but because of enormous interest payments which take up nearly 20 percent of our entire annual spending, our budget is still in the red. 
We must be careful about confusing serious budget balancing efforts with partisan exercises that could disrupt the fiscal foundation of the country. 
One of my major concerns about this amendment 2 years ago which remains today is that the House still has in place a rule requiring three-fifths supermajority vote to raise income tax rates and income tax rates alone. Under the House rule, other taxes--such as the gas tax, Social Security tax, or other excise taxes--can still be raised by a simple majority, taxes that impact far more many of the working families from New Mexico whom I represent. This House rule stands as an obstacle to efforts to use the income tax, our most progressive tax, to raise revenues for deficit reduction. 
The balanced budget amendment that has been proposed does not help us resolve many of the problems that challenge our future economic health. Passing this resolution does not help us solve the challenge to Social Security that looms in our future. It is clear that we must address the problem of solvency of the Social Security trust fund, but as written this amendment could cause a train wreck at the point 
when Social Security disbursements become greater than Social Security receipts. At least under one interpretation of the proposed amendment, countless seniors could experience disruption in receiving their checks. 
During a time of severe economic hardship and recession, the Government has traditionally helped by using fiscal policy to prime the economy and jolt it toward growth. Such a strategy would not be possible given the requirements outlined in the balanced budget amendment. In addition, national security demands, the need to increase spending to thwart aggressive moves by some future enemy, or to respond to some military crisis might also be improperly constrained by the balanced budget amendment as written. There is also no provision in the balanced budget amendment permitting Congress to develop a capital budget, a budget capable of distinguishing between spending to meet current operating expenses and spending over a series of years for major capital improvements, such as highways, buildings, or a Federal agency's computer systems. I voted for amendments that would have made improvements in the balanced budget amendment and which would have made this a more workable piece of legislation, but all of these improving amendments were defeated. 
The authors of this amendment are pursuing too rigid a course--and are bent more on a theology of balanced budgets without taxes than they are on the economic health of the Nation. 
Also left unaddressed in this proposed amendment is the enforcing mechanism. When the Congress fails to govern responsibly and does not produce a balanced budget as called for by the Constitution, does the Supreme Court, as the chief interpreter of the Nation's Constitution, decide what accounts will be advanced and what accounts cut in order to achieve balance? These matters are unresolved and threaten to create confusion and harm our Nation's fiscal solvency--rather than create the order and balance that the Nation needs and wants. 
I will oppose the balanced budget amendment today because I believe that we should leave the question of how to achieve sound fiscal policy to a vote of a majority here in Congress. We should not try, by rule or other provision, to determine how future Congresses choose to reduce the deficit or keep the budget in balance. We should not dictate whether they cut spending or raise taxes. We should not try to predetermine for future Congresses, as this amendment would, which group of taxpayers will pay the taxes and which group will suffer the spending cuts. Because of the way that the balanced budget amendment is constructed, our decisions would be locked in permanently if this amendment were to become part of the Constitution. This is not wise, and I cannot support such an effort. 
The framers of the Constitution chose to leave neutral the way in which sound fiscal policy is achieved. We are well advised to defer to their good judgment on that subject, to cease our efforts to solve this problem by changing the Constitution, and instead, to solve it as we should--by continuing to make tough choices that reflect the priorities of our Nation.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first I would like to call attention to several recent reports that have come out on the issue of high academic standards and the need for high standards and national standards in our schools, and refer to those reports and perhaps put them in context. 
I think it is clear from the reports that I am going to refer to here that there is a need for accelerating the progress that our country is making in developing world class academic standards. It is also clear that the States and local school districts are having great difficulties in determining for themselves what those standards ought to be, which is a large and costly task. 
First, I will refer to the comprehensive Third International Math and Science Study that was recently released. It shows that math standards have not yet been implemented at the classroom level in many of our schools, and our students score at or below the average on math and science compared to students in other nations. 
Mr. President, you will remember that one of the goals which the Governors and President Bush established in Charlottesville in 1989 was that the United States would be first in the world in math and science by the year 2000. In fact, the reality is very different from that lofty goal that was set 8 years ago. 
This first chart here indicates the average math scores of eighth graders on international tests. We can see in the group of nations that are considered top performers that the United States is not listed. Those nations are Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, and Belgium-Flemish. 
In the middle range, the United States is at the very bottom, far behind the Russian Federation. 
After us, there are the bottom performers, and the most we can say with pride is that we are not in that category. 
But, Mr. President, I think most parents in this country would aspire to our doing better than we are showing we have done on this test. And I hope very much that we can. 
Here is a second chart that makes somewhat the same point. This chart indicates that of students scoring among the top 10 percent of eighth graders on international tests, 45 percent of these were from Singapore, and 34 percent from South Korea. It goes on down to where, in math the United States had only 5 percent of the world's top students in math, and only 13 percent in science. So, clearly, again, we find ourselves very far down on the list of nations in this comparison. 
There is also a new national report card on education that has been published by Education Week, which is a respected publication in our country. It confirms the findings of several previous reports that the standards many States have now established may not be rigorous enough compared to other nations' standards, and, also, that there are all too few States that plan to hold students or teachers accountable for measurable results. 
Let me show you these two charts to make this point, Mr. President. The first of these is a chart entitled, `Who's Accountable?' What this essentially says is that only those few States that come up on the map here as colored yellow are States that have standards for their graduates from high school. Clearly, most of the country--and, unfortunately, my State included--do not have accountability standards that students have to meet in order to graduate from high school. Clearly, this is a problem that we need to address as a nation. 
Another chart, `8th Grade Math Course-Taking.' This indicates very clearly that most of our eighth-graders are simply taking general math and only 19 percent, according to this analysis, are, in fact, taking algebra at the time they go into the eighth grade. This is one of the reasons we do so poorly on the international comparisons of mathematics scores. 
Finally, the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress math scores, which were just released last week, show that over 30 percent of 4th, 8th, and 12th-graders lack basic math skills, despite recent progress. 
Let me show you that chart, Mr. President. When you look at this, you can see a very modest upward trend from 1990 to 1992 to 1996 at the three different grade levels, 4th, 8th, and 12th. As you can see, we are nowhere near approaching the level of improvement that is necessary if we are going to meet any of the national goals that we have set out for ourselves. 
Delays in developing standards have been made worse by the fact that, despite the abundance of tests and report cards published by State and local education agencies, very little of the information is comparable from district to district, or very little of the information is set at a high enough standard for us to make reasonable comparisons to these international tests. 
As Education Week recently pointed out, `If the data that we depend on to monitor the economy were as incomplete, as unreliable, and as out of date as the data we depend on to monitor education in the United States, we might as well have the economy of a Third World country.' 
Instead, we have a hodgepodge of different tests and standards, most of them testing basic skills rather than world-class materials, a lot of data that only describes how students in one area are doing compared to how they did in the previous year. 
Differences in student `pass rates' on State and national testing indicate enormous gaps in what we are testing for. Let me show you the final chart that I have here, Mr. President, to make that point. You can see from this chart entitled `State NAEP Scores for 4th Grade Reading Compared to the State's Own Assessment' that, for example, in the State of Wisconsin, it shows 
here that 35 percent of the students are shown to reach the standard that NAEP sets on their National Fourth Grade Reading Test. In their State standard test, Wisconsin shows 88 percent of their students meeting the standards. So you can see there is very little comparability between what the States are testing for and the level of performance that they are expecting and what the NAEP, the national assessment, is testing for. 
As a result, we still have schools that are doing superbly, and we also have schools that are doing miserably. Many times they are in the very same areas and in the same school districts. Parents and educators often do not even know which of those types of schools their own children are in. 
In response to this situation, many have come to agree that we need to set our standards much higher and we need to gather more accurate information in order to improve achievement, as has been done with great success in several parts of the private sector. 
The National Association of Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Business Round Table have now focused their joint efforts on raising standards and promoting more accountability in our schools. 
The National Education Association president, Bob Chase, spoke out about the need for his 2.2-million-member union to support key changes such as these. 
Frequent education critics Checker Finn and Diane Ravitch recently offered surprising enthusiasm for standards. Let me quote: `how powerful it will be for parents and teachers to compare the math prowess of 8th graders in, say, Phoenix and Minneapolis, to the performance of their peers in Korea and the Czech Republic.' 
In addition to national polls showing strong support for high standards, a Public Agenda poll last month showed that high school students themselves know that our expectations for them are low, and those very high school students respond accordingly. 
Raising academic standards has proven to be an immense and costly job for States and for school districts, who have been left to do the job largely on their own. They have been struggling to make the necessary progress but have been unable to do so. For these reasons, we need renewed national efforts toward making standards a reality in the near future.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the recent death of a great education leader, Albert Shanker, who was as committed and effective in the fight for National standards as anybody in our country. For those of us who believe that the Federal Government should do more to improve the quality of education in the country, Al Shanker's death was a great loss. More than anyone else in the Nation, Al Shanker was the visionary pushing for higher standards and national standards for teachers and students alike. 
In a recent piece in the Washington Post, E.D. Hirsch, Jr., said it very well: 
If a single person could be said to be responsible for the shift in sentiment that prompted the President to call, in his State of the Union Address, for national educational standards--a proposal that would have been unthinkable a few years back--it would be Al Shanker. 
Albert Shanker had an abiding belief that collectively we in America could improve the lives of all of our citizens. He dedicated his life to that belief. He also believed passionately that public schools were the great strength of our country and were the means by which we could improve the lot of Americans. 
A recent essay by Albert Shanker was contained in the New York Times. I would like to read two paragraphs from that. This is an essay that he wrote in a publication a few years ago. He said: 
Why do I continue when so much of what I've worked for seems threatened? To a large extent because I believe that public education is the glue that has held this country together. Critics now say that the common school never really existed, that it's time to abandon this ideal in favor of schools that are designed to appeal to groups based on ethnicity, race, religion, class, or common interests of various kinds. But schools like these would foster divisions in our society; they would be like setting a time bomb.  * * * * * 
Public schools played a big role in holding our nation together. They brought together children of different races, languages, religions, and cultures and gave them a common language and sense of common purpose. He was not outgrown our need for this; far from it. Today, Americans come from more different countries and speak more different languages than ever before. Whenever the problems connected with school reform seem especially tough, I think about this. I think about what public education gave me--a kid who couldn't even speak English when I entered first grade. I think about what it has given me and can give to countless numbers of other kids like me. And I know that keeping public education together is worth whatever effort it takes. 
Al Shanker believed that the National Government needed to commit itself to improving our Nation's schools. Should we have national education goals? Al Shanker believed strongly that we should. Should we have educational standards? Al Shanker believed we should so that every parent could determine whether their child was getting the education that they deserved. 
Mr. President, I was privileged to work with Al Shanker on several issues but, most importantly, on the issue of improving standards for our schools. His vision and his strength of commitment were always an inspiration. 
With his death, the American Federation of Teachers lost a superb president and all of us in America lost a tireless champion for public education and for a better America. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about an American hero and an American patriot, CWO-05, Harry Floyd Hinkle, Jr. 
As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am presented almost daily with young men and women who have dedicated their lives to the service of their country in our Armed Forces. As I know my colleagues agree, these men and women are truly America's finest. Today, it is an honor for me to present to the Senate an example of America's best, Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle. 
Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle will soon be retiring from the Marine Corps after 30 years of honor, patriotism and distinguished service. I have not had the privilege of meeting CWO-05 Hinkle personally, however, a review of his record clearly demonstrates why it is appropriate for the Senate to honor him today. 
CWO-05 Hinkle joined the Marine Corps on February 7, 1967. He spent 3 years in Vietnam with the First Armored Amphibian Company, 11th Marine Corps Regiment. While serving in Vietnam he was awarded the Bronze Star with Combat V. 
Mr. President, for most men and women that service alone would have been more than above and beyond the call of duty, but not for Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle. He returned from Vietnam where he was appointed warrant officer and later commissioned as an officer eventually reaching the grade of captain. In 1990 when his country called upon him to once again serve in the face of great danger, Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle responded. He served in Desert Storm and Desert Shield where he guided deployments to southwest Asia for installing and operating secondary imagery dissemination devices. 
Mr. President, Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle has served as an enlisted marine, officer, and warrant officer. He has shown gallantry on the battlefield and has been a model marine in the classroom. He served heroically in the past and has helped make America's future safer by training the marines, airmen, soldiers, and sailors of tomorrow. Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle's personal decorations include the Bronze Star with Combat V, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy Achievement Medal with Combat V, the Good Conduct Medal and the Combat Action Ribbon, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal, and the Southeast Asia Service Medal. 
Mr. President, after 30 years of service to his country, I believe that America owes Chief Warrant Officer-05 Hinkle a thank you, a heart-felt God's speed, and a proud semper fi.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the Rural States Highway Preservation Act. This is an act that would ensure fairness in the distribution of funds from the Highway Trust Fund. But more importantly, Mr. President, this bill ensures that we continue our commitment to maintain a national transportation system, that in doing so, we meet all the Nation's transportation needs and, just as importantly, the unique needs of our States that have small populations and very large geographic areas, States such as New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Alaska, Nevada, Montana, and Wyoming. 
My home State of New Mexico has only 14 people per square mile and its total land area is 121,335 square miles. Residents of large, rural States like New Mexico pay more per person in gas taxes because of the long driving distances. It is not uncommon for New Mexicans to travel 50 or more miles to their nearest large town or country seat, where they have to go to get essential supplies, health care, school, or interact with their government. To maintain this infrastructure, New Mexicans currently pay one of the highest per capita State taxes to maintain the same highways used by interstate trucks or the tourists who visit our beautiful State. Under any eventual ISTEA reauthorization that does not address these unique characteristics, New Mexico and similar States would lose highway funding that it could never recover. Under devolution, for example, New Mexico would have to impose at least a 17.8-cent gas tax just to generate the same revenue as it received from the Highway Trust Fund in 1995. Such a proposal would be devastating not only for our residents, but for the many trucks that cross our State, and for the increasing traffic between Mexico and the United States. Such a proposal would impair new Mexico's highways, but because we are but one part of a national transportation system, it would impair our national system. 
The Rural States Highway Preservation Act would ensure that transportation funds that will be distributed under a reauthorized ISTEA will be done fairly, with consideration to the uniqueness of States with low population density and high geographic area, and with our national transportation needs as a priority. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, our Nation has been very fortunate over the years to have had distinguished, capable representatives serving as our Ambassadors to the United Nations. It is my honor today to speak on behalf of yet another distinguished American, Bill Richardson, who has been nominated by the President to serve in that capacity. 
Let me offer a few words of strong endorsement for my colleague. Bill Richardson and I first campaigned together in 1982, when he was running for the House of Representatives and I was running for the Senate. 
Starting with that 1982 campaign, and in the 15 years since then, I have continued to be impressed by his resourcefulness, by his energy, by his talent for winning the trust and respect from people of diverse backgrounds with widely varied points of view. 
Much has been made of the successful diplomatic efforts that he has engaged in in the last few years, but I would like to say just a few words about his performance on his so-called day job, that is, his job as Congressman for the State of New Mexico. 
As you know, Mr. President, New Mexico is a State of many cultures. We have a very large native American population, a very large Hispanic population, a community such as Los Alamos, which has the largest number of Ph.D.'s per capita of any city in the world. 
Bill Richardson has managed to gain the trust and support of each of these as well as many other groups and has been a very effective and successful Congressman receiving very large majorities each of the eight elections that he has stood for in our State. 
Bill will demonstrate the same resourcefulness, energy, and skill in building trust and rapport in the United Nations that he has demonstrated in New Mexico. We in New Mexico will be losing a very capable and effective Representative in Congress, but the country will be well served by having Bill in this key position of advocacy in the world's key international institution. 
Mr. President, I strongly recommend to my colleagues that they vote to confirm the nomination of Bill Richardson for the U.N. Ambassador position.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes commenting on some of the points the President made last night in his State of the Union Address. I was particularly impressed and encouraged about his decision to make education the centerpiece of that speech and his decision to make education the first priority of his administration this next 4 years. 
One aspect of what he talked about in education, I think, is extremely important, and that is standard setting. We have had debates in Congress for many years now about the issue of standards. In fact, I introduced legislation in 1990 to establish national standards in education, and, of course, we are continuing to pursue that through the National Education Goals Panel, which I serve on along with Senator Jeffords. 
I am persuaded that part of what the American people would like to see in their educational system is higher standards and more accountability. They want to be sure that teachers are performing to a high standard, students are performing to a high standard, and the parents of children in our public schools want to know where their children stand relative to other students around the country, around their State, and in general. 
The President in particular talked about how he was going to work through the Department of Education to adapt two widely used high-quality tests--the fourth grade NAEP reading test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which is already being used in more than 40 States, and the now-familiar eighth grade math test, the TIMSS test, which recently confirmed how poorly many of our students are doing relative to the achievement level of other nations. 
The President proposed adapting those two tests into a new test that will be available free of charge to every student, every school district, and every State in the Nation that wishes to participate in it. This is going to be done in the next 2 years. 
I think this will be a major step forward, because what it will do is to allow us to give very hard, objective information about which of our schools are succeeding and which of our schools are failing. We have the anomalous situation that, because of our inability to track performance, we have in many school districts and major cities in the country some schools that are doing superbly and other schools that are doing miserably. Parents, unfortunately, sometimes do not even know which of those two schools their children are in. 
For this reason, we need to give parents clear indications of which schools are doing the best job in educating students. Currently, we have a hodgepodge of different tests, a hodgepodge of different standards around the country. Parents who are interested in finding out how their children are doing often are misled by inaccurate information. So I very much commend the President for this initiative to adapt these two well-recognized tests into something which each student can take, each parent can understand, each school can understand. I think that will be a major step forward. 
Let me also talk about another aspect of the standards issue, which the President, I hope, will also move ahead on very aggressively, and that is the teaching of advanced placement courses. Many of us are familiar with advanced placement courses because of our own children going through high school. These are courses that are taught in the 11th and 12th grades, generally to students who are planning to go on to college and who want to get advanced credit so they can avoid taking the same course once they get there. 
We have not done what we should at the national level to 
encourage States and school districts to expand instruction in advanced placement courses. I believe this year, for the first time, we will see a change in that. I hope to see the President, in the budget we receive tomorrow, requesting some funds to assist low-income students in the cost of taking those advanced placement courses and tests. That, I believe, would be another major step forward. 
I had the chance to speak to the New Mexico Legislature on Monday of this week, and I talked to them about the challenge that my State faces in expanding access to advanced placement classes. These courses should be available to all students. They are highly demanding, but any willing student can succeed in them. 
Many people know about the advanced placement program because of a movie that came out several years ago called `Stand and Deliver.' This was a movie that Edward James Olmos starred in. It was the story of Jaime Escalante, a high school calculus teacher, I believe in Garfield High School in east Los Angeles. He had become very famous in that school and in that school district because of his success in teaching students, many of them students without a good academic grounding. He would teach those students this advanced placement course in calculus. 
The reason he became famous and the reason that movie was made was not because he was teaching any old calculus course. He was teaching a course that was an advance placement course so that anybody in the country who paid attention would know that was a high-quality course. If his students in east Los Angeles passed that course, they were every bit as good as any student in Manhattan, or Ohio, or in New Mexico, or anywhere else. So they got the recognition that they deserved. He got the recognition that he deserved. They were very proud of their achievement. 
I have believed for a very long time that one reason our school system falls short is that we expect too little of our students. We have low expectations for what our students can learn, what our children can learn. The truth is, if you expect very little, you will receive very little. We need to expect higher performance by our students, higher performance levels by our teachers, and through this advanced placement set of courses we do exactly that. 
New Mexico lags behind the national average fairly significantly in the per capita rate of 11th and 12th graders who take advance placement courses. 
In my State I think the percentage is something like 24 percent. Nationally it is 40 percent. We need to do better than that. We can do better than that. We are setting about working with the business community and our State legislature to bring together the resources to expand the training of advanced placement teachers and to expand course work in advanced placement courses. 
I think one other point needs to be made. It should be obvious to everybody. You are not going to bring about a major reform of education, a major improvement and upgrading of education, without a very major program to reeducate and develop the human capacity to do that. We need to have training courses for our teachers in the summer. These advanced placement courses are very good. But, unfortunately, too few teachers are able to take advantage of them, or do take advantage of them. 
So we need to think seriously in this Congress about what we can do to support the retraining that is needed to get people to these higher standards that the President is talking about. This is an essential part of the agenda that we need to confront over the next couple of years. 
I commend again the President for his leadership in putting this on the front burner for the country. I hope we, in Congress, are up to the task of following his lead. I think he has identified a very important priority for our country. It is the one that I hear the most about. 
I get around New Mexico a lot, and people want to know why we can't do a better job of educating kids in this country. I hope that we can.

Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate, Mr. President, the statement of the Senator from North Dakota. 
Let me just add one other element to this. I commend him for his proposal to deal with the problem of someone coming into school with a gun and no one being able to apprehend him. I am also persuaded that virtually everything we want to see happen better in our schools will be facilitated if we recognize that we need to have smaller classrooms. 
Much of the crime, discipline, and absentee problems in our schools today are because the schools are too large and because the teachers do not know the students by their first names. The students don't feel accountable to their peers. We put 40 kids into a class and wonder why the teacher can't teach all of them. We put 2,000 or 3,000 kids in a high school and wonder why the principal can't keep track of everybody. 
There have been some very good studies done that show that the optimum size for a high school, for example, is somewhere between 600 and 900 kids, and that when you go over 900 the quality of the students' performances start dropping, the discipline problems start rising, and the incidence of criminal problems start rising. We need to factor this issue into what we do as well. 
Of course, we in Congress don't make the laws that govern the size of the schools, and we should not. But we need to encourage States and local school districts to take that into account when they decide to build a new high school. You don't necessarily need to tear down the old building. You can take an existing complex and break it into two or three high schools just as well as leaving it in one 3,000-person high school.

Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota and his comments. 
Let me say one other thing and then I will yield the floor, Mr. President. I was on a radio interview program earlier this morning, and one of the reporters, who is a very knowledgable reporter, said to me, `The President said we ought to increase funding for education by 20 percent. That is a very major increase. Can we afford that kind of an increase given the budgetary constraints on us?' 
My response was that you have to look at this in the context of the overall Federal budget. In the overall Federal budget, we spend somewhere near 1.5 percent on education, which represents less than 10 percent of overall spending by States and localities. So what the President is saying is that we ought to spend 1.8 percent, or thereabouts, on education. Most of the people I talk to in New Mexico do not think that is excessive. I think it is not unreasonable for the Federal Government to give education that high a priority. 
So I hope very much we follow the President's lead. I hope very much we will make education the centerpiece of our efforts here in this 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to create a National Cave and Karst Research Institute in Carlsbad, NM. This bill will continue the efforts started by Congress in 1988 to develop the information needed to effectively manage and preserve the Nation's cave and karst resources. 
In 1988, Congress directed the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to provide an inventory of caves on Federal lands and to provide for the management and dissemination of information about the caves. The results of that effort have increased our awareness that cave and karst land forms are a resource we must learn how to manage for our future welfare. For example, in America, the majority of the Nation's fresh water is groundwater--25 percent of which is located in cave and karst regions. As we look to the 21st century, the protection of our groundwater resources is of critical importance, especially in the arid West. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that caves contain valuable information related to global climate change, waste disposal, groundwater supply and contamination, petroleum recovery, and biomedical investigations. Caves also often have historical or cultural significance. Many have religious significance for native Americans. Yet, academic programs on these systems are virtually nonexistent; most research is conducted with little or no funding and the resulting data is scattered and often hard to locate. 
To begin addressing this problem, in 1990 Congress directed the National Park Service to establish a cave research program and to study the feasibility of a centralized cave and karst research institute. In December 1994, the National Park Service submitted to Congress the National Cave and Karst Research Institute Study. As directed by Public Law 101-578, the report studied the feasibility of creating a National Research Institute in the vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park. The report not only supported the establishment of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute, but also concluded that now is the ideal time to consider it. 
The report to Congress lists several serious threats to our cave resources from continued uninformed management paractices. These threats include alterations in the surface waterflow patterns in karst regions, alternations in or pollution of water recharge zones, inappropriately placed toxic waste repositories, and poorly managed or designed sewage systems and landfills. The findings of the report conclude that it is only through a better understanding of cave resources that we can prevent detrimental impacts to America's natural resources and cave and karst systems. 
The goals of the National Cave and Karst Research Institute, as outlined in the report, would be to develop and centralize scientific knowledge of cave resources, foster interdisciplinary cooperation in cave and karst research programs, and to promote environmentally sound, sustainable resource management practices. The National Cave and Karst Research Institute would be jointly administered by the National Park Service and another public or private agency, organization, or institution as determined by the Secretary. 
Mr. President, the Park Service report to Congress also notes that the vicinity of Carlsbad Caverns National Park is ideal particularly in light of the incredibly diverse cave and karst resources found throughout the region and the community support which already exists for the establishment of the institute. Numerous varieties of world class caves are located nearby. Furthermore, the Carlsbad Department of Development, after reviewing the National Cave and Karst Research Institute study report, has developed proposals to obtain financial support from available and supportive organizational resources--including personnel, facilities, equipment, and volunteers. The Department of Development also believes that it can obtain serious financial support from the private sector and would seek a matching grant from the State of New Mexico equal to the available Federal funds. 
Mr. President, my legislation will help provide the necessary tools to help discover the wealth of knowledge contained in these important, but largely unexplored landforms. Carlsbad, NM already has in place many of the needed cooperative institutions, facilities, and volunteers that will work toward the success of this project. It is imperative that we take advantage of these conditions and establish the National Cave and Karst Research Institute.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, with many of my colleagues, I traveled to Lowell, MA, last Thursday for the funeral of our friend, Paul Tsongas. He died at age 55. His battles were many, and so were his victories. His grace and courage will stand for many of us as beacons in our own lives. 
Paul befriended me when I was running for the Senate. His desire to spend more time with his family caused him to retire at the close of his first term here, and our Senate days overlapped by only a couple of years. Still, he was an influence on my life, and certainly on my career. 
There is no disagreement that Paul was one of the outstanding sons of Massachusetts. The affection for him and grief over his death which we all felt at the services are the kinds of emotions reserved for one of the family. The people of Massachusetts respected him, and valued what he stood for. We all did. 
When he served in the Senate, one of the items in his office was a framed quotation from one of John Adams' many letters to his wife, Abigail. The Massachusetts College of Art had produced it in January 1980. I had admired it on visits to Paul's office and when Paul left the Senate, he sent it to me, with a handwritten note. I treasure them both, and the feeling behind John Adams' words: 
I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy * * * in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, and music * * * May 12, 1780. 
I believe Paul Tsongas took this message to heart, and that it guided much of what he did. The country is fortunate to have had such service from such a man.

 Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last week my State and this country lost an extraordinary man. Clyde Tombaugh, a retired New Mexico State University professor, died on January 17 at the age of 90. 
In 1930, at the age of 24, this completely self-taught high school graduate was working at an observatory in Arizona when he spotted something unusual in a photographic plate. Remarkably, his discovery turned out to be the ninth planet, Pluto. 
His discovery earned him a full scholarship to the University of Kansas to study astronomy, and he went on to a long and distinguished career. He founded the research astronomy department of NMSU, and retired in 1973 and served as professor emeritus. 
This `remarkable man of science,' as one colleague described him, has left a truly great legacy.

Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I was very pleased that at the end of the last Congress, we finally did the right thing by education. We increased funding for education. It was a bipartisan effort. We got good support in the waning days of that Congress for improvements in education. 
This time I believe we should not wait until the end of the Congress. I believe that education needs to be a top priority of this Congress beginning now and continuing on through the rest of the first session and, of course, the second session as well. 
For this reason, I think it is timely that Education Week, which is perhaps the preeminent weekly publication dealing with education issues at the national level, issued its report card on the condition of public education in the 50 States just as this new Congress is beginning. 
The report is entitled `Quality Counts.' It is a very comprehensive, thorough look at the issue, and it goes through great detail in trying to assess how each State is doing in providing education to its young people. 
I recommend this report to all of my colleagues and anybody who is watching. I think it does a good job. It focuses where we need to be focused. I think it needs to be taken very seriously by this Congress. 
In the area of quality of teaching, which I am sure we would all agree is essential to a strong education, this report finds that 40 percent of high school teachers lack a college degree in the subject area that they are teaching in. There are too many unlicensed teachers being used in our classrooms today. Ongoing training is still not a reality in most of our States. So the national grade that we received for quality of teaching was a C, which I think all of us who have been through the educational system know is not a stellar performance. 
A second finding is about `school climate.' Here the findings were that nearly half of elementary teachers have classes of 25 or more students. More than half of high school teachers see in excess of 80 students per day. Almost 70 percent of students attend high schools of 900 or more. 
The reason that this last statistic is important is that we have several studies now that conclude that the quality of education and the quality of student performance goes down as the size of the school increases. When you get a high school of more than 900 students the quality and level of student achievement goes down. So it is unfortunate that a majority of our students are in schools which our own experts tell us are too large. That is something we need to focus on nationally, and we got a C-minus on school climate because of those facts I just cited. 
Third, on `overall spending,' the States received a C-plus. The report found that most of the increases in spending have gone toward rising enrollment and special education and salaries for an aging work force. And we are not putting the resources into education that we should be, considering the growth in the school population. 
Fourth, on `equity of funding', which means the disparities between the rich school districts and the poor school districts, the States got a B-minus. This is a little better than we have done in some of the other areas, but the report finds that the quality of the child's education still depends too greatly on skin color, on family income, and on which school district they happen to reside in. 
The fifth indicator is the effective `allocation of funds.' According to the report, classrooms still receive only 61 percent of total resources that go into our educational system. Too many of those resources get stopped at the administrative level. On average, there are still over 35 students for each multimedia computer in our school system. Thirty-three percent of districts have at least one serious school construction need. So in that area of allocation of funds, the States received a C-minus. 
The sixth area is `standards and assessments.' There the States got a B because the conclusion was that this is the area perhaps where we are making the most progress. However, in most States standards have not yet found their way into the classrooms. Even if tests were developed, we do not yet know how rigorous they are, and few States are ready to hold either the schools or the students sufficiently accountable. 
The final indicator is `student achievement,' which of course is the bottom line, the ultimate goal of our educational system. They did not give a grade there. They said that in student achievement our `results were disappointing.' That was the phrase which was used. The report finds that only 28 percent of fourth graders nationwide ranked as being proficient in reading, which is not an adequate level of performance. Even the highest scoring States in the Nation have fewer than half of their elementary students scoring proficient in reading and in math. 
Madam President, let me put this in some perspective. Many of us who try to follow education-related issues know that we have a national test that is given around the country periodically called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP for short. This is a chart that shows trends in NAEP reading scores from 1971 through 1994. You don't need to look at this chart long before you notice that all of these lines are not going up. These lines are flat. That means that we essentially are seeing no significant improvement in reading scores by students in this period from 1971 to 1994. Madam President, we are stuck on mediocre, or perhaps stuck on even worse than that. I think this is a cause for concern. 
When I look at my own State and read this report there are three areas in which New Mexico performs above the national average. We get an A for standards, compared to the B that most States get. We get a B for overall educational spending, versus the C that is given nationally by this report. And we get a B-minus for classroom resources, versus a C-minus nationally. 
There are three other areas, however, in which my State of New Mexico performs worse than the national average. First, the State's test scores still are near the bottom in this National Assessment of Educational Progress test in almost all areas. Only 21 percent of the fourth graders in my State were judged to be at the proficient level in reading, and only 11 percent were judged proficient in math. Also we received a C-minus for teaching quality, compared to a C nationally. And we received a D-plus for school climate compared to a C-minus nationally.
