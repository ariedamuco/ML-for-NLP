Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Children's Online Privacy Act was reported out of Committee by voice vote. Because of time constraints at the end of the session, we have been unable to file a Committee Report before offering it as an amendment on the Senate floor. Accordingly, I wish to take this opportunity to explain the purpose and some of the important features of the amendment. 
In a matter of only a few months since Chairman McCain and I introduced this bill last summer, we have been able to achieve a remarkable consensus. This is due in large part to the recognition by a wide range of constituencies that the issue is an important one that requires prompt attention by Congress. It is also due to revisions to our original bill that were worked out carefully with the participation of the marketing and online industries, the Federal Trade Commission, privacy groups, and First Amendment organizations. 
The goals of this legislation are: (1) to enhance parental involvement in a child's online activities in order to protect the privacy of children in the online environment; (2) to enhance parental involvement to help protect the safety of children in online fora such as chatrooms, home pages, and pen-pal services in which children may make public postings of identifying information; (3) to maintain the security of personally identifiable information of children collected online; and (4) to protect children's privacy by limiting the collection of personal information from children without parental consent. The legislation accomplishes these goals in a manner that preserves the interactivity of children's experience on the Internet and preserves children's access to information in this rich and valuable medium.

 Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to announce the enactment of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. This historic legislation passed the Senate on October 8th and President Clinton signed it into law on October 19, 1998. 
Mr. President, this legislation has its roots in the Southern Nevada Public Lands Task Force. The Task Force was originally established in the summer of 1994 by Congressman Jim Bilbray to provide an open forum in which public land issues affecting the Las Vegas Valley could be discussed among federal, state, local, and private entities. It is comprised of representatives from the State of Nevada, Clark County, the cities of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, and Henderson, the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the Regional Flood Control District, the Clark County School District, and representatives of the development and environmental communities. 
At its inception, the Task Force set two primary goals for itself: (1) to establish and maintain a better working relationship between the BLM and local governmental planning agencies; and (2) to develop a `master plan' for the Las Vegas Valley that identified those BLM lands which should be transferred to private ownership and those which should be retained for public purposes. 
In the summer of 1995, Senator Reid and I reconvened the Task Force to build on the goal of developing a `master plan' for the Las Vegas Valley. We worked closely with the Task Force in our efforts to develop a legislative proposal that sought to improve the current BLM land disposal policy in the Las Vegas Valley; this proposal eventually became the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which Senator Reid and I introduced in the Senate on March 19, 1996. Congressman Ensign then introduced a companion bill in the House, and I have enjoyed working with him in a bipartisan fashion over the last several years to fine tune this legislation and shepherd it through the Congress. 
The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act is a response to perhaps the greatest challenge facing Southern Nevada--the need to promote responsible, orderly growth in the Las Vegas Valley while protecting the surrounding environment and enhancing the recreational opportunities that exist in Southern Nevada. In the broadest sense, the legislation reflects a partnership between federal, state, and local entities to enhance the quality of life in the Las Vegas Valley and throughout the State of Nevada. 
As many of my colleagues are aware, the Las Vegas valley is the fastest growing metropolitan area in the country. Since the beginning of this decade, nearly five thousand people each month, on average, have chosen to make Las Vegas their 
 new home. Last year alone, nearly 20,000 new homes were built in the Las Vegas valley to accommodate this explosive growth. And while the majority of Southern Nevadans have welcomed the benefits of an expanding, robust economy, there is a realization within the community that a long-term, strategic plan must be developed to deal with growth related problems. 
Both State and local elected officials are currently grappling with different ideas as to how best to meet the infrastructure needs and quality of life expectations of current and future generations of southern Nevadans. Local officials estimate that new infrastructure development over the next ten years will cost between three and eight billion dollars for such things as school construction and water, sewer and transit systems. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the situation, the Clark County School District needs the equivalent of a new elementary school every 30 days for the next five years to keep pace with the twelve thousand new students entering the school system every year. 
Mr. President, this legislation is a critical component of Southern Nevada's long term plan to manage growth in the Las Vegas valley. Each time the BLM transfers land into private ownership it has important repercussions for the local governmental entity that must provide infrastructure and services to that land. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) controls in excess of 20,000 acres of land throughout the Las Vegas valley. Consequently, unlike most communities, land use planning decisions are not made solely at the local level; the BLM is an important player in the local land use planning process. This legislation would strengthen the partnership between the BLM and local government and improve upon the current land use planning process. 
The BLM's primary method of disposing of land in the Las Vegas valley, through land exchanges, has been the subject of much attention over the past several years. I happen to believe that land exchanges serve a valuable public purpose--the Federal Government disposes of land it no longer needs in exchange for land that is worthy of public ownership. In the Las Vegas valley, however, the real estate market is such that it does not lend itself well to appraisal-driven land exchanges. Disagreements between the BLM and exchange proponents over appraisal methodology and value determinations are often the cause of protracted delays in the land exchange process. Because of the dynamic nature of the real estate market in the Las Vegas valley, any delay in the exchange process can cause the appraisals to become outdated before the transaction is closed. 
Mr. President, the legislation before us today would make two significant improvements over the current land exchange process: (1) it would allow local land managers to take a more pro-active role in federal land disposal decisions; and (2) it would institute a competitive bidding procedure to ensure that the disposal of BLM land yields the highest return, or true `fair market value.' There are currently over twenty-five land exchange proposals pending in the BLM's Las Vegas office--some are clearly in the public interest, others are not. The vast majority of these proposals are intra-state 
exchanges, meaning the BLM has the authority to process them without Congressional action. This legislation would open the process to allow anyone who wishes to bid on BLM land to do so in a competitive sale, and it would eliminate the need to enter into protracted appraisal negotiations over selected BLM land that so often bog down the already cumbersome exchange process. The legislation stands for the same proposition as the current land exchange process--the sale of federal land in the Las Vegas Valley should be used as a means of protecting environmentally sensitive land throughout the State of Nevada and of enhancing the use of public land recreational areas in Southern Nevada. 
At the conceptual level, the legislation represents a synthesis of two previously enacted public land bills that specifically address public land management issues in Southern Nevada--the Santini-Burton Act and the Apex land transfer legislation. You may recall that the Santini-Burton Act, which was enacted in 1980, authorized the sale of BLM land in Las Vegas to fund the acquisition of environmentally sensitive land in the Lake Tahoe basin. Our legislation embodies a similar proposition--the sale of federal land in the Las Vegas Valley should be used as means of protecting environmentally sensitive land throughout the State of Nevada and of enhancing the use of public recreational areas in Southern Nevada. With nearly 5,000 new residents moving into the valley each month, it is imperative that we protect our open spaces around the valley from development and expand recreational opportunities for the public in order to maintain the quality of life we have come to expect in Southern Nevada. 
Also in keeping with Santini-Burton, our legislation recognizes that land use planning decisions are best made at the local level, so our proposal gives local government an equal voice in deciding when and where federal land sales should occur in the valley. The map referenced in section 4 of the bill would establish a boundary for future BLM land sales and exchanges in the Las Vegas Valley, and combined with other components of the bill, it would serve as the blueprint to assist us in designing public land policy for the 21st century. The map essentially represents the maximum build-out boundary for the valley; it was generated in close consultation with local governmental planning agencies and other members of the Task Force to reflect their vision for future growth and development in the valley. It is important to note that virtually all of the BLM land recommended for sale or exchange under this bill has already been identified for disposal by the BLM under the existing Management Framework Plan for the Las Vegas Valley. In fact, our legislation would reduce the overall amount of land available for disposal in the valley. 
The Apex land transfer legislation, enacted in 1989, transferred over 20,000 acres of BLM land just outside the Las Vegas Valley to Clark County for the development of a heavy-use industrial site. When the land is improved and eventually sold by Clark County to a private entity, the revenue sharing provisions of the act allow Clark County recover the value of the infrastructure improvements it has made to the land before providing the federal government with its share of the proceeds from the sale. The 
legislation before us today recognizes the same principle--that the presence or proximity of local governmental services and infrastructure increases the value of federal land. Consequently, our legislation would direct a portion of the proceeds of federal land sales to local government to assist with local infrastructure development and to the state for the benefit of the general education program. 
Another important component of this legislation that I want to highlight today is involves affordable housing. This legislation will also make BLM land available throughout the State of Nevada to local public housing authorities for the purpose of developing affordable housing. There is currently a tremendous need in Los Vegas and Reno, and also in other communities throughout the state, for raw land to develop affordable housing projects. The BLM will now be able to assist each of these communities in meeting this important need. 
In closing, Mr. President, I want to acknowledge those members of the Public Land Task Force that played such an important role in the development of this legislation. Thanks go to Mike Dwyer of the BLM, Jim Tallerico and Alan Pinkerton of the Forest Service, Alan O'Neill and Bill Dickensen of the Park Service, and Ken Voget of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Thanks also go to State Senator Dina Titus, Pam Wilcox of the State Land Use Planning Agency, Rick Holmes, Jeff Harris, and Ron Gregory of Clark County, Pat Mulroy of the Las Vegas Valley Water District, Robert Baggs of the City of Las Vegas, Steve Baxter of the City of North Las Vegas, John Rinaldi of the City of Henderson, Gale Fraser of the Flood Control District, Dusty Dickens of the School District, Randy Walker and Jacob Snow with the Clark County Department of Aviation, and also Bob Broadbent, the former Director of the Aviation Department. A number of citizens representing the environmental community provided invaluable assistance; they include Jeff Van Ee, Lois Sagel, John Hiatt, Bob Maichle, and Steve Hobbs. From the development community thanks go to Robert Lewis, Bob Campbell, Scott Higginson, Mark Brown, and Jeff Rhoads. And finally, I want to thank Marcus Faust for all of his hard work on behalf of Clark County. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank two members of my staff, Brent Heberlee and Sara Besser, for all of their work related to this legislation. 
I believe this legislation will make great strides toward improving public land management policy in Southern Nevada, and I look forward to continue working with all interested parties as this legislation is implemented.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss two provisions included in the conference report accompanying H.R. 4101, the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. 
First, I want to express my gratitude to the House and Senate conferees for retaining a provision in the conference report that was originally passed here in the Senate relating to the Market Access Program. 
As my colleagues are aware, the Market Access Program is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through its Foreign Agriculture Service. MAP funding is designed to reimburse private companies, industry associations and cooperatives for the promotion of brand-name products as well as generic commodities overseas. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, it has become quite clear that the Market Access Program is a flagrant example of a federal spending program gone wrong--one that is simply unproductive, unjustified and unaffordable. 
Over the past few years, I have stood here on the Senate floor several times to highlight the assorted flaws with this program, particularly the outrageous reality that we are channeling millions and millions of taxpayers dollars to some of the most prosperous corporations in America, including Sunkist, Welch Foods, Gallo and General Mills. 
My efforts to terminate the Market Access Program were endorsed by a sweeping coalition of fiscal watchdogs, including Taxpayers For Common Sense, National Taxpayers Unions, Citizens Against Government Waste, Friends of the Earth, Citizens for a Sound Economy and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
Unfortunately, proponents of this policy made claims about the program that were difficult for the General Accounting Office to refute as a result of the lack of available information about the effectiveness and value of the program. Clearly, greater scrutiny of this program is appropriate and necessary. 
In July of this year, the Senate passed an amendment that I authored to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that I believe will have a profound effect on the future of the Market Access Program. I am pleased this provision has been retained in the conference report before us today. 
This provision requires the USDA to estimate the impact of the Market Access Program on the agriculture sector as well as on U.S. consumers, while also considering the costs and benefits of alternative uses of the funds currently allocated to MAP. 
Additionally, the amendment requires USDA to evaluate the additional spending of participants and the amount of exports additionally resulting from the Market Access Program. 
I believe, Mr. President, that this information will allow the General Accounting Office to produce a useful evaluation that will enable Congress to make an informed, responsible decision about the utility of continuing this program in future years. 
Unfortunately, while this amendment will throw a spotlight on one wasteful federal spending program, I am concerned that another provision in this conference report could compromise past and future efforts to rein in other wasteful and unnecessary federal expenditures. 
As part of an effort to provide economic assistance to farmers and producers who have been hit hard by the worsening weather and market conditions facing rural America, this legislation includes roughly $6.5 million in the form of recourse loans for mohair producers. 
Perhaps this funding assistance is warranted. Clearly, the entire agricultural community is reeling from prolonged disastrous weather conditions, a 20-year low in commodity prices and dwindling overseas exports. 
It is imperative that we provide to our producers in need, timely disaster and other economic assistance for crop losses and other related dilemmas. 
However, we must be clear in stating that the emergency assistance provided in this bill for mohair producers is not in any way, shape or form an attempt to resuscitate the mohair subsidy program that was shut down by the Congress just a few short years ago. 
My colleagues will recall that the mohair subsidy program originated in 1954, when Congress passed the National Wool Act, authorizing a subsidy program to guarantee the production of domestic wool for military uniforms during the Cold War era. 
Mohair, which was used for decorative braids on military uniforms, was inexplicably affixed to the wool subsidy program. 
Over the years, the need and justification for both the wool and mohair subsidies has plainly evaporated. Yet in 1992, years after the sun had set on the Cold War and the strategic need for wool and mohair had long expired, wool producers were still receiving roughly 130 million dollars in subsidy payments while mohair producers were still receiving about 48 million dollars. 
In light of this, I joined with several of my colleagues in 1993, including Senators Kerry and Feingold, in terminating the wool and mohair subsidy that had existed for nearly forty years. We shut that program down. 
That was no small accomplishment, Mr. President. 
The Congress is clearly capable of, and has been somewhat successful in reducing the size, scope and funding for a number of federal spending programs. 
But to actually terminate a program and to categorically wipe that program clean from the federal budget, is indeed, an uncommon achievement. 
Mr. President, I am not here to dispute the contention that mohair producers are deserving of emergency assistance. Certainly, virtually every component of our agricultural community has been adversely affected by the crisis that is facing our Nation's farmers and producers. 
But I do want to take this opportunity to express to the distinguished Chairman and distinguished Ranking Member of the Subcommittee my sincere hope that the inclusion of this funding for mohair producers is not an attempt to re-open the wool and mohair subsidy program that was shut down by Congress just a few short years ago. 
Terminating the wool and mohair subsidy was a small step on the road to a balanced budget, and I fully intend to monitor this situation next year. If we are to stay the course of fiscal responsibility, we must make sure that the American taxpayer is not forced to subsidize those antiquated programs the Congress has deemed to be wasteful and unaffordable.

The floor leader is absent from the floor temporarily and will return shortly. Perhaps the Senator may be able to engage in a conversation with him and the distinguished Senator on the other side of the aisle as to working out this point. I am not able to give the distinguished Senator the assurance that he needs that we can approve it.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I would like to preface my comments by commending the floor leaders, my good friends, Senator McCain and Senator Ford, for the leadership they have provided in getting this piece of legislation through the committee and on to the floor. I am not unmindful of the fact there are some points of contention, but both of them have provided the kind of leadership and experience and real statesmanship we have come to expect from both of these two leaders. And I, for one, want to praise them for their leadership. 
I want to talk about one of those points that has become historically somewhat vexing when we deal with an FAA piece of legislation, and that is the so-called perimeter rule. The perimeter rule is extremely important to my State, Nevada, and particularly the expanding markets in southern Nevada. Within the next year, 20,000 new hotel rooms will come on line. It will be critically important to have additional air capacity going into southern Nevada in order that those new hotel rooms can be filled. The Metropolitan Las Vegas area will have in excess of 120,000 hotel rooms within the next 18 months. 
I know of no place in the world that has that concentration of hotel rooms. It is no secret that the mainspring of the economy in southern Nevada, as well as the entire State, has been for decades tourism. And because of the relative remoteness and isolation of southern Nevada, air transport is a critical factor for our continued economic viability and the expansion that we have enjoyed over the years. 
I was able, with the support of the distinguished chairman of the committee, the senior Senator from Arizona, to convene a hearing in Las Vegas earlier this spring, because one of the challenges that we face in providing additional air service to southern Nevada are some economic changes that are occurring in the airline industry itself. 
During the time in which the economy was relatively soft and business travel was not particularly robust, it was much easier for us in southern Nevada to get the kind of air service and the number of flights that we needed. As a result of the expanding economy and business travel expanding quite rapidly, the airlines have reached an economic judgment which, although hard to quarrel with, nevertheless has had some profound implications for us in Las Vegas. And that is to say that business travel, as opposed to recreation travel, generates more revenue per seat mile than does resort, tourist destination travel. 
So the airlines, to some extent, have shifted some of their capacity to the more profitable business routes. That change poses some real challenges to us in trying to fill those hotel rooms, I mentioned earlier in my comments, that are coming on line. That would be the largest influx of new hotel rooms in the history of Las Vegas for any given period of time. So as part of this hearing that we held in Las Vegas, we looked at a number of factors that might help to alleviate that problem. 
One area in which we desperately need expanded air service is from longer distance destinations, from the east coast. And one of the things that was pointed out as part of the barrier to that new service is that there are some artificial barriers that are created either by act of Congress or by policy, and to the extent that we can remove those barriers, it will be easier for us to get expanded air service. 
One of those barriers that was created by an act of Congress is the perimeter rule, established in 1986 as part of Federal legislation. 
That was part of the Metropolitan Washington Airport Act. 
Some history of the perimeter rule. In its initial origin, there may have been some justification for it. At the time, there was considerable concern that Dulles would not attract the kind of airline service needed to fully utilize that facility if, indeed, longer distance flights could originate out of Washington National or could come to Washington National. 
So this perimeter rule--which has kind of taken on a life of its own and has been exalted almost to divine status, something that is so sacrosanct that we should never touch it under any circumstances--is in point of fact an act of Congress' creation, and it is not inappropriate for the Congress to revisit that rule. 
The General Accounting Office, in examining airline competition, bolsters the argument that was made at our hearing in Las Vegas when it describes the perimeter rule as `a barrier to entry service.' It points out that the rules limit the ability of airlines based in the West to compete because those airlines are not allowed to serve--LaGuardia is another airport which has a perimeter rule, as well as National Airport--from the markets where they are strongest. By contrast, because of their proximity to LaGuardia and National, each of the seven largest established carriers is able to serve those airports from its principal hub. So there is an invidious discrimination in the very existence of these perimeter rules. 
This report, as well as others, has suggested to the Congress that we grant authority to allow exemptions to the perimeter rule. I believe that is a sound recommendation and one that has been carefully crafted by my colleagues and friends who provide the leadership for us in the Commerce Committee, because a compromise has indeed been offered. 
Let me add an additional basis, it seems to me, for that compromise to occur. Not only does this invidious discrimination make it very difficult for new entrants to come into the market, but the original justification for the rule in 1986--if it ever had any validity, if one assumes arguendo that it may have been well founded at the time of its enactment--no longer exists. 
You will recall that the original or ostensible justification was to make sure that Dulles as an airport had plenty of activity and airline service, and therefore this artificial creation of the perimeter rule was designed to make sure that the longer distance flights emanated from Dulles. Having been to Dulles many times in the last month, none would argue that this airport is underutilized. It is a robust, healthy air terminal, and all of us are pleased for that. 
On two bases, it seems to me, the argument can be made: No. 1, that the original rationale and predicate of the perimeter rule no longer has any operative merit; and No. 2, the competitive aspect in the discrimination which I have alluded to in citing from the airline competition, `The Barriers to Entering Into Domestic Markets,' published by the General Accounting Office. 
I think for that reason the provisions that have been crafted into this piece of legislation dealing with additional slots at National, particularly those 12 which will be allowed to fly outside the perimeter, represent sound policy and a reasonable compromise. 
Again, I commend the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Ford, for their leadership. I hope we can get this enacted. I salute them for their leadership. 
I yield the floor.

I note from the chart the Senator has brought to the floor that the State of Nevada is included.

Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate the statesmanship my friend has provided and the information that is made available with respect to the situation in Nevada. I might just add to the comments of the Senator that, having lived in Nevada for more than 57 years and knowing each of our four district court judges personally, I do not know of a harder working bench at either the State or Federal level anywhere in America. Frankly, it required considerable statesmanship of the former chief judge in Nevada in electing to take senior status, which the Senator from Florida fully understands, that allowed a new district court judge to come on board. That senior judge, together with another colleague of his who is a senior judge, maintains an extraordinarily active caseload. So that has helped but has not eliminated the backlog to which the Senator has addressed his comments. 
I must say, `justice delayed is justice denied.' The State of Nevada has the fastest growing population in the country over the past decade. That is reflected in the litigation in the Federal court system, based not only in the demographics but other situations which I am sure the Senator will allude to. So I want to join with the Senator from Florida in calling this very important issue to the attention of our colleagues and the American people. This is not an issue about lawyers or judges per se. What we are talking about are the needs of people who have their issues brought to the Federal court system and who are entitled to have those issues resolved in a prompt manner. With respect to those who violate Federal law, they need to have those matters addressed promptly in the interests of justice for all Americans. I think the proposal the Senator is about to unveil and explain in greater detail is entitled to the support of our colleagues. I wish him well and pledge my support in his efforts. 
I thank him again for his leadership on this issue.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for his leadership on this issue. The banking industry is enjoying its sixth straight year of record profits, which topped $60 billion last year. That is good news. But unfortunately, as part of a growing trend, these record profits are coming from an increasing proliferation of fees on bank customers. The number of these separate bank fees has grown from 90 to 250 over the last 5 years. 
Last year, banks made more than $3 billion alone on ATM surcharges. That is the new cash cow. And this is in addition to the $1 billion banks are paid as part of the interchange fee, which covers their cost of ATM transactions. So, that is where the surcharge comes in. The banks are already compensated through an interchange system. They are imposing an additional fee, a surcharge, which Senator D'Amato and I and others object to, which, in effect, imposes a charge twice on the customer. 
Mr. President, $1.50 or $2 for every ATM withdrawal may not seem like a lot, but over the course of a full year it adds up to several hundred dollars. Many banks for years prohibited these ATMs. In fact, three out of every four ATMs that are in place today were built before surcharges were prohibited, so the argument that somehow prohibiting the surcharge would limit the availability of ATMs is simply a specious argument. Two States that come to mind immediately, Connecticut and Iowa, prohibit ATM surcharges, and there is no evidence to suggest that customers in those two States are deprived of the option to use ATMs. 
So, people, in effect, kind of feel entrapped. Initially the banks offered ATMs because they reduced the costs of their transactions. They are much less expensive than the teller transactions. Customers responded because of the convenience. A win-win proposition. Once customers got induced to use ATMs, then they got hooked, and now they are being reeled in by the bankers with these new charges, because the average ATM transaction cost is about 27 cents while a transaction involving a teller costs the bank roughly $2.93. 
ATM charges are unfair, because the consumer is charged twice for the same transaction. Additionally, ATM surcharges have the anticompetitive effect of pressuring people to leave small banks--which may be their choice--for their larger banks, to avoid this double charge or the surcharge. I urge my colleagues to support the able and distinguished chairman and to support this. 
Let me just tell you, both in Nevada and around the world, this is how the public views the ATM surcharge. You will note from the chart there, the ATM reaches out with a loaded pistol and the customer is held hostage. That is what these ATM surcharges are all about. 
I urge support for my colleague's thoughtful legislation, I yield the floor, and thank the Senator for extending the privilege of the floor to me.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I support the Enzi amendment. I think a statement may be helpful to my colleagues who have not followed this issue as closely as the Senators who have joined us on the floor for purposes of discussing this amendment, the statement of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that a page of history may be more instructive than a volume of logic. This issue dates back to the time of a court decision involving the Cabazon Indian Tribe. As a result of that decision, the Congress, in 1988, passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which has been referred to in the course of this debate as IGRA. 
I think the philosophical underpinnings of that legislation continue to be valid. Let me make it clear, because sometimes my view is misconstrued, I support the right of Indian tribes to enjoy entrepreneurial gaming activities to the same extent that State law, as a matter of public policy, permits those entrepreneurial activities to be available to all. So this debate is not whether you agree with Indian gaming or disagree with Indian gaming. I believe the tribes, subject to the qualification I have just stated, have a right to participate in gaming to the extent that, as a matter of State policy, a State chooses to permit gaming entrepreneurial opportunities. 
We have marked contrasts in the West. The State of Utah, as a matter of State law--as the distinguished Senator from Colorado just pointed out--as a matter of State policy, permits no form of gaming. It is, in my judgment, clear and properly so under IGRA that no tribe within the State of Utah would have a right to participate in any form of Indian gaming. 
The contrast to my own State is quite marked. In Nevada, as a matter of public policy since 1931, a full range of gaming entrepreneurial activities are available to the citizens of Nevada, and it is clear that the tribes in Nevada have the same opportunity. And, indeed, there have been five compacts negotiated with the tribes in the State of Nevada to permit that. 
Under IGRA, gaming is divided into three different categories referred to as class I, class II, and class III. Class I and class II are not a part of this discussion. Class I deals with traditional Indian games; class II deals with bingo, and class III deals with casino types of gaming, including slot machines. 
Again, to repeat, the premise of IGRA is that a Governor of a State is obligated to negotiate with a tribe to provide the same opportunities to tribes in his or her State to the extent the States, as a matter of law, permit gaming in general in that State. 
Here is what brings us to the floor again this year, as my distinguished colleague from Wyoming points out. Under IGRA, what is contemplated in those States that permit any form of gaming is a compacting process under State law, where the Governors--and, indeed, in the law of some States it is the Governors and the State legislators--are required to negotiate with the Indian tribes within that State to provide those tribes with an equal opportunity to participate in the entrepreneurial aspects of gaming. There is no quarrel by this Senator with respect to that approach. 
Here is what gives us cause for great concern. Some tribes have asserted that if the Governors of a respective State refuse to grant them everything they want by way of gaming, even though what they want is beyond what is permitted as a matter of State law, that that constitutes bad faith in the negotiating process. They want to be able to bypass that process; namely, the negotiation with the Governors, and in some States the negotiations with the Governors that must be approved by the State legislature. 
The Enzi amendment does two things. No. 1, it prevents the Secretary of the Interior from moving forward to promulgate the final regulation that would, in effect, seek by regulation to bypass or change the procedure that currently exists. The second thing the amendment does is to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from, in effect, bypassing the compacting process and authorizing a compact that is not in compliance with State law. 
My colleague from Wyoming has pointed out that this is an issue that is bipartisan in nature; this is not something that divides us on a partisan basis. It does not divide us regionally. It does not divide us philosophically. Some of my colleagues who have spoken oppose gaming in all forms. I respect that. This Senator does not take that position. But the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General--both organizations of which I have been privileged to be a member in the past when serving as attorney general and Governor of my State--have gone on record as supporting the Enzi amendment. The reason why they are supporting this amendment so strongly is they want to preserve the right of State governments to determine, as a matter of policy, what, if any, form of gaming activity is permitted. 
So, for those who find some type of invidious discrimination in this process, I must say this Senator does not. To the extent that a State permits gaming, it is clear that Governors are obligated to negotiate that same right to 
Indian tribes within the State. To the extent that a State, such as Utah or Hawaii, permits no form of gaming, the Governors of those two States are not required to enter into any kind of compact because those States, as a matter of public policy, have the right to determine what that policy is, and they have said, as a matter of public policy, they oppose gaming, do not want any form to exist within the State. 
I must say, I thought we had hopefully put this issue to rest a year ago when we offered a similar amendment to the appropriations bill. I thought we had sent a clear message that the Congress of the United States does not want the Secretary of the Interior to bypass a process provided by law; namely, for Indian tribes to negotiate with the Governors as to what kind of gaming activity is to be permitted in that State consistent with that State's public policy. No sooner had this issue been approved by this body, the other body, and it became part of the Interior appropriations bill last year, than the Secretary of the Interior began a rulemaking process that, in my judgment, is violative of the spirit and contrary to the law in terms of what is his authority. 
It is that disagreement that brings Governors from all regions of the country, Democrat and Republican, in support of the Enzi amendment. It is that same concern that brings the Nation's attorneys general together in a similar bipartisan way to strongly support the Enzi amendment. They do so as a matter of preserving and protecting the ability of each State to determine how much, if any, or how little, gaming is to be permitted within that State. 
So, this is not, my colleagues, an issue of whether one favors Indian gaming or opposes Indian gaming. It is not an issue of whether you support gaming or oppose gaming. This amendment is designed to preserve the existing law which gives to each State Governor and the legislature the ability in that State to determine whether gaming is to be permitted and, if so, what form of gaming. 
This is an extraordinarily significant piece of legislation. I must say, I am not familiar with any circumstances currently in the country where the tribes have not been able to negotiate a compact with those States that permit some form of gaming. At last count, there were 150 compacts negotiated in 20 States, pursuant to the law that was enacted by Congress in 1988. I am not suggesting that IGRA is perfect. I am not suggesting that some modification or change may not be needed with respect to some aspect. But that is a decision for the Congress of the United States, not a decision for the Secretary of the Interior. So I implore my colleagues to support the Enzi amendment in a bipartisan fashion, because what it seeks to accomplish is to reserve to the respective States the ability to determine what public policy will be with respect to gaming activities conducted within that State. 
As I have observed throughout my comments, to the extent that a State as a matter of public policy has determined that they will permit some form of gaming, it is clear in IGRA that State Governors are obligated to negotiate those same entrepreneurial opportunities, and I have no quarrel with that. That is the law. But what we are really talking about here is an attempt to make an end run around IGRA. To the extent that the Secretary of the Interior, by regulation or by determining that an impasse exists, is able to bypass the State compacting process, no longer is it the State determining what the public policy with respect to gaming in that State may be. It is the Secretary of Interior. I have great respect for the Secretary of Interior but, with great respect, that is not an authority that he, or any Secretary of Interior, ought to have. 
That is an authority that ought to be reserved to the State and the State legislature. We would do real violence to the very carefully crafted balance that was accomplished in IGRA when that was adopted a decade ago. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Enzi amendment when this comes for a vote. I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment. 
This past summer, as I have each summer since being a Member of the Senate, I spent most of my time in what we in Nevada refer to as `cow county' in rural Nevada. Most of that time I spent in places that are not widely known outside of Nevada. I was in Wells, Wendover, Elko, Battle Mountain, Winnemucca, Lovelock, Ely --some of the smaller communities in our State, but communities that are very dependent upon mining as the principal base of their economy. 
In the northeastern part of our State, as a result of the situation that relates to the international pricing of gold at or near record levels over the last 20 years, these communities are hurt. These are good-paying jobs of $46,000 or $47,000 a year with the full range of health benefits. They are premier jobs. These communities are hurting. Sales tax collections are down. 
So this is a major concern about what is happening to the principal economic base in the northeastern part of our State, which is a mining industry. 
I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Arkansas that would prevent the National Academy of Sciences from studying Federal and State environmental regulations applicable to hard rock mining on Federal lands. 
As many of my colleagues from the West are aware, the Interior Department is proposing major revisions of the regulations that govern hard rock mining on public lands known as 3809 regulations. The regulations were originally promulgated in 1980 and require miners to submit plans for operations for approval by the BLM. The existing regulations require mine operators to comply with all Federal and State environmental laws and regulations, require that lands disturbed by mining be reclaimed, and require that bonds be posted to assure that reclamation is complete. 
The State of Nevada has one of the toughest--if not the 
toughest--State reclamation programs in America. Nevada mining companies are subject to a myriad of Federal and State environmental laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act, among many others. 
Mining companies must secure literally dozens of environmental permits prior to commencing mining activities, including a reclamation permit, which must be obtained before a mineral exploration project or mining operation can be conducted. 
Companies must also file a surety or a bond with the State and the Federal land manager in an amount to ensure the reclamation of the entire site prior to receiving a reclamation permit. 
Let me just say parenthetically that both as Governor and Senator I have been to these mining locations for many, many years. Mining today is much different than mining was even a generation ago, and much, much different than it was a century ago. 
Some of the well-advertised misdeeds of mines in the past have to be freely acknowledged as something that is a source of major concern in terms of its environmental impact. I think it is an embarrassment to the modern-day mine manager whose philosophy and approach is much different and who is sensitive to the concerns as to the environmental impact. That represents the new Nevada and the mining operations that exist in my State with which I have firsthand familiarity. 
A number of the Western Governors, including our own Governor of Nevada, Governor Bob Miller, have expressed genuine concern about the 3809 rulemaking--that it will unnecessarily duplicate existing Federal and State regulatory programs. Governor Miller, in his testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this year, suggested that Congress call for an independent evaluation of the need to revive the 3809 regulations, and made the suggestion that the National Academy of Sciences would be an appropriate organization to conduct a sufficient study. I concur. The academy has a preeminent reputation for fairness and balance. This is not a committee that is associated with the mining industry, nor controlled directly or indirectly by them. 
I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee saw fit to follow the suggestion of Governor Miller, because I must express that I, too, have serious questions concerning the need for the Interior Department's proposed regulations and revisions. The current 3809 regulations require compliance with all existing Federal and State environmental standards and requirements, including the Clean Water Act, the State water quality standards in particular. 
The Interior Department proposes to add a new layer of requirements on top of existing laws for both surface and ground water which extends beyond the agency's regulatory reach--far beyond management and protection of Federal lands. These proposed rules, if adopted, would result in inconsistent or duplicative water quality standards or technology requirements because BLM can no longer accept State or EPA determinations as compliance with the 3809 regulations. I must say it is somewhat ironic that the duplication of existing Federal and State water quality programs resulting from this proposal will, in my judgment, impose substantial additional costs on the Bureau of Land Management without any corresponding environmental benefits. 
The proposed regulations allow States to continue the common practice of joint administration of mine regulation--and this is significant--but impose unrealistic demands for Federal approval of State programs. The Interior regulations will effectively federalize reclamation laws in all of the Western States even on non-Federal land because the States must amend their laws and regulations to comply with the Federal model in order to enter into an agreement for joint administration. Interior has proposed this requirement without any showing that existing State reclamation laws and programs are inadequate. 
And finally, the proposed regulations include numerous additional procedural and substantive requirements that will encourage delay in mine permitting and appeals and litigation over permitting decisions. It is clear that the Secretary of Interior is attempting to rewrite the mining law through the regulatory process. I share the Secretary's desire to update the mining law, and I would say for the record that Nevada's mining industry is in the forefront of recognizing that the mining law of 1872 needs to be updated. But that is a job for Congress, not unelected bureaucrats. I am hopeful that the discussions that have been occurring between my colleague, Senator Bumpers, and the mining industry will lead to an agreement on mining law. In the interim, however, I think it is important that we allow the National Academy of Sciences to assess the need for the Interior Department's proposed regulations, and for that reason I urge my colleagues to defeat the Bumpers amendment. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, and I thank him and the senior Senator from Arizona for their leadership on campaign finance reform. They have been faithful to the cause. They have been leaders on the floor and they have, I think, engaged the American people at long last in a colloquy so that I believe, as I will comment later in my remarks, the American public now has a better understanding of what is at issue here. 
Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of the legislation brought to the floor by Senators McCain and Feingold. I must say that I am pleased--`overjoyed' may be an understatement--that the Senate has at last an opportunity to revisit this issue. 
Although campaign finance reform has been derailed in the past by a perennial filibuster, the event of passage of the Shays-Meehan legislation in the House has provided us with a golden opportunity to move past the procedural maneuvering that has obstructed this important legislation for far too long. 
The volume of evidence from our most recent Federal elections clearly demonstrates that our current system has spiraled completely out of control. It is no longer a system of rules but a system of loopholes, and through these loopholes has poured a staggering amount of money that continues to escalate each and every campaign cycle. 
We no longer have a system in which candidates are encouraged to debate their records and their positions on the issues. We no longer have a system in which candidates are encouraged to look for votes by shaking hands at a coffee shop or greeting workers at a factory gate and knocking door to door at residents' homes. 
Sadly, the system in place today encourages candidates to look not for votes but for money. It is a money chase, Mr. President. And all of us are part of this unsavory system. And only we can change it. It is a shameless and demeaning system. And that just speaks to the extraordinary sums of money that candidates themselves are required to raise and spend. 
Add to that the millions and millions of dollars raised and spent by the national political parties and outside special interest groups who have perfected the art of saturating an entire State with political ads months and months before the election day. 
Mr. President, those who continue to oppose meaningful campaign finance reform must be living in a different world. I simply cannot fathom how anyone can look at the chaos of our past and current elections and suggest that the response of the U.S. Senate should be to do nothing. 
During the recent August recess, I had the opportunity to travel widely throughout my home State of Nevada and to meet face to face with thousands of my constituents. In fact, by automobile I traveled more than 3,000 miles through Nevada, visiting with some of the smallest communities in our State and holding 17 townhall meetings during the course of this recess. 
Time and time again, the issue of campaign finance reform was raised at these townhall meetings. It was deeply unsettling to see firsthand how disgusted the American people are with the absolute scandal taking place in our campaign finance system. These were not politicians talking about the need for reform. These were ordinary people who have become so disillusioned with our political process that they no longer feel any sort of connection to our democratic system. 
This is a dangerous threat to democracy itself. 
Let me also point out that as often as this issue was raised, not a single person, not one, expressed opposition to the McCain-Feingold bill on campaign finance reform. No one. Absolutely no one. 
Thankfully, the House of Representatives has provided us with the opportunity to at least stop the hemorrhaging of our current finance system. Several weeks ago, on a strong, bipartisan vote, the House passed the Shays-Meehan bill which was modeled on the McCain-Feingold legislation before us today. This was not just a handful of Republicans voting with Democrats to pass this legislation. In point of fact, one quarter of the entire House Republican conference voted for that bipartisan bill which passed by a margin of 252-179. 
Now, I have heard some of our colleagues, in expressing opposition to campaign finance reform, argue that just because the House has passed this legislation, it does not mean we should do so. I must say I have a different interpretation of the present situation. Shame on the Senate for not passing campaign finance reform in the past; shame on the Senate if we refuse to do so now when we have the opportunity to do so. 
Some of us, myself included, would have preferred more comprehensive reform legislation than McCain-Feingold offers. But it is an important step, a vital step, on the road to campaign finance reform. Its centerpiece is the ban on the so-called soft money. Banning these unlimited and unregulated contributions would represent the most important political reform enacted by the Congress in more than two decades. Let me repeat this: Banning these unlimited and unregulated contributions would represent the most important political reform enacted by the Congress in more than two decades. 
Despite the 3-year long filibuster of this legislation, we have heard very few opponents come down to the floor and stand up and defend the virtues of a $250,000 in soft money contribution or more. Soft money is an embarrassment to the American political system. It is the mother of all campaign finance loopholes and perhaps the most ingenious money-laundering system in history. Soft money as we know it refers to the unlimited and unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals that flow to the political parties, unchecked and unregulated, outside the accepted contribution limits and reporting requirements of Federal law. This soft money, with little or no disclosure, is then poured into what have become known as issue ads, a nickname given to television and radio advertisements that skirt Federal election laws and fall under no regulations. This money is raised and spent with virtually no limits and no disclosure. 
How much soft money can be contributed? Sadly, the sky is truly the limit. In fact, there are no limits to this incredulous, bizarre system. In 1992, just 6 years ago, the two parties raised and spent a combined $86 million in soft money. In just 4 years, soft money more than tripled, exploding from $86 million in 1992 to $262 million in 1996; $260 million that was raised and spent, completely outside the scope of Federal election law. 
Perhaps the only thing worse than to know how this soft money is raised is to know how this soft money is being spent. In recent years, the airways have been bombarded, saturated with political ads paid for with soft money. These political ads specialize in shredding various candidates without telling the viewers who paid for the ad, where the money came from, and who was responsible for its content. 
It should come as no surprise to any of us that more and more Americans are repulsed by these anonymous assaults and the sheer volume of money pouring into our election system. As a consequence, they are distancing themselves from the political process. That is the greatest tragedy of all. Americans are so turned off by our political system that they don't even vote on election day. When they do vote, often it is not the sense of voting for the better of two candidates; it is a perception that they are voting for the lesser of two evils on the ballot. 
With a tidal wave of campaign cash flowing into our political system, the torrent of negative advertising on the airways, and the lack of meaningful disclosure or accountability, it is becoming increasingly difficult, almost impossible, for the American people to feel good about any candidate, or their participation in the democratic process. 
Just last week, in my home State of Nevada, we had a critically important primary election. Not only is there an open gubernatorial seat in a hotly contested primary, there were primaries for the U.S. Senate, an open House seat, and a number of seats in the State legislature. I am sad to report that only 28 percent of all registered voters in Nevada turned out for this election--28 percent. Let me make an important distinction. That is not 28 percent of all Nevadans who were eligible to register and to participate in the system. That is 28 percent of those who are actually registered. This is a tragedy. It is not good for our system. Seventy-two percent of all registered voters in Nevada did not vote. And Nevada is not alone. 
I have heard it said that if one looks at the entire primary election cycle this year--and I presume they are factoring in those who are eligible to register and chose not to do so, as well as those who are eligible to vote, having registered but chose not to vote--less than 17 percent of the people in America have participated in the electoral process this year. This is a disaster wherever one comes down in the political scale. Whether one registers himself or herself more closely aligned with Democrats or Republicans, independent Americans or Libertarians, wishes to revive the old Know Nothing party, would like to see the old Whig party revived, or want to be part of the avant garde 1990s and become a member of the vegetarian party, wherever one comes down on the political spectrum, 72 percent of those registered to vote not participating is a system that we cannot sustain and still have a representative democracy in America. 
In addition to cutting down the soft money system, the McCain-Feingold proposal would place significant restriction on the issue ads which I have just described. Under the Snowe-Jeffords modification, if a radio or television advertisement mentions a candidate's name within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election, the funds used to pay for that advertisement must be raised under Federal election law and must be fully disclosed. Some outside organizations have suggested that they have a constitutional right to freely discuss an issue with the electorate. I agree. In fact, under this legislation, any organization can run an advertisement on any issue they want--whether it is health care reform, gun control, or any other issue--with no restrictions. 
That is a true issue ad and a sort of communication that the Supreme Court has said is free from government regulation, and properly so. The Supreme Court has also said that we can regulate advertisements that are not meant to advocate issues, but instead are meant to advocate candidates. That is what this legislation provides. True issue ads would be exempt from this legislation. However, if an organization chooses to run an ad in the weeks before an election, and if that ad is clearly designed to advocate for or against a particular candidate who is involved in that election, this legislation will define that activity as election related, and the money used for those ads will be required to be raised and spent under the provisions of Federal election law. 
Finally, in addition to banning soft money and enacting tough restrictions on candidate ads, the legislation includes a number of provisions that will improve the disclosure of fundraising activities and provide the Federal Election Commission with greater tools to detect and to investigate campaign finance abuses. 
Unfortunately, it appears that once again it will require 60 votes to move this important legislation through the U.S. Senate. I, for one, would like to see us move past these procedural games and start having real votes and real issues and debate campaign finance reform on the merits, on the substance. Let's vote on whether or not we should ban all soft money. Let's vote on whether these thinly disguised attack ads should be considered election and campaign ads subject to Federal election law, and let's vote on whether we should strengthen our disclosure requirements under the Federal Election Commission and provide that Commission with greater tools to ensure that all candidates and all parties and outside groups are playing by the rules. 
After the outrageous amount of money spent in the 1996 election, after all the charges and countercharges of abuse, impropriety and quid pro quo, and after what we have already witnessed in the opening months of the election season this year, it would be appalling, in my judgment, if the 105th Congress were to adjourn without passing a single reform of this deplorable system. 
Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold legislation and begin the process of restoring a sense of integrity and confidence to our democratic process. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Craig amendment. Three million children in America today are on line on the Internet. By the year 2000, 15 million children will be on the Internet. 
Senator Kyl and I have offered an amendment which takes a public policy which I think every parent in America will support; that is, to prohibit gambling on the Internet. There simply is no way to control access to the Internet and to the types of gambling that are offered. 
If the Craig amendment is adopted, that policy is effectively emasculated. 
I join with the junior Senator from Arizona in asking this body to defeat the amendment because every child and every home in America that is on the Internet will have access to gambling on the Internet. 
My view is that there is no public policy that would support, in effect, a carve-out to say that we prohibit gambling on the Internet in America for everyone except Indian tribes. That makes no sense, may I respectfully submit to the Presiding Officer and to my colleagues. 
If you believe, as Senator Kyl and I do, that Internet gambling should be regulated and that we should not have access to Internet gambling by children, vote against the Craig amendment. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me say in response to my good friend, the able Senator from Delaware, every States attorneys general in America supports this amendment. Mr. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, supports this amendment. 
Under the current law, Internet gambling is spreading all over. There are 140 web sites, $1 billion. We seek to close that door. The Kyl-Bryan amendment seeks to prohibit Internet gambling for everyone--for everyone--so it is not an expansion of gaming. 
We want to take gambling off the Internet so kids, libraries, and everybody else who can dial up on the Internet these days will not have access to an Internet gambling site. There are currently 140. That is twice as many as the year before. A year from now, there will be 500 if we don't close this hole. The Christian Coalition, everyone from major league sports teams to the attorneys general to the consumer groups all support this amendment.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to preface my comment, before I say anything specific about the legislation, commending the Senator from Arizona for his untiring and unflagging efforts, trying to perfect an amendment which I am pleased to cosponsor. The junior Senator from Arizona has spent the better part of this past year working with various groups, specifically the States' attorneys general who are the prime movers in this amendment. I believe the amendment which he has offered, and the underlying amendment which I have offered as a second-degree amendment, accomplishes the purposes that we intend. 
This amendment is supported by a wide spectrum of interest. I am aware that within this Chamber there is a broad diversity of perspectives and viewpoints on gaming. Some States, such as my own, have adopted for decades open and regulated casino gaming. Other States, such as the States of Utah and Hawaii, by their public policy pronouncements through their legislative actions, permit no gaming at all. But I think it is indicative of the broad spectrum of support that this Internet gaming prohibition amendment enjoys, that from Ralph Reed to Ralph Nader, all of the groups that may represent the spectrum in between, have joined with Senator Kyl and me in supporting this amendment: The Christian Coalition, the National Association of Attorneys General, from public citizen to the National Football League, and other groups as well. 
Let me cite, if I may, a couple of reasons for that. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, the National Hockey League, Baseball, Office of the Commissioner, National Basketball Association, major league soccer, are in strong support of the Internet gaming prohibition amendment that we are debating this evening. In a letter received by my office on March 25: 
We are writing to urge you to support the passage of S. 474, [that is in effect the amendment that we have before us] the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act of 1998. As amateur and professional sports organizations, we believe that S. 474 would strengthen existing enforcement tools to combat a growing national problem--illegal sports gambling conducted over the Internet.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, the National Association of Attorneys General have been the prime mover of this legislation. The distinguished occupant of the Chair has served as an attorney general from his State and, indeed, headed the National Association of Attorneys General. As the distinguished occupant of the Chair and others know, States' attorneys general do not frequently come to the Congress of the United States and ask for legislation unless they are of the opinion that State action is insufficient and incapable of addressing the problem. That is the view of the National Association of Attorneys General in urging Senator Kyl and me and others to move forward with the legislation that bears the S. 474 designation, and which, in essence, is the amendment we are debating on the floor this evening. 
The attorneys general make a very important point. They say, in part, in a letter which was sent to me on March 20 of this year, and signed by a number of States' attorneys general that: 
The potential problems cautioned by the availability of games worldwide through the Internet are exacerbated because of the current inability of Internet technology to address many of the policy considerations that have caused states to create such widely disparate legal and regulatory schemes. 
Then they go on to say in this letter: 
Additionally, there is currently no [I want to emphasize `no' effective technological means to verify the physical location of players and proprietors in order to ensure the participants and businesses are operating under the laws of the individual jurisdictions where they are physically located. 
That is the view of the Nation's attorneys general as they have come to the Congress and asked us to support this legislation.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think my colleague has done an extraordinarily good job and given a very clear explanation of what we are seeking to create in this amendment. This simply represents an update to reflect the change of technology. Under current law, it is illegal to wager over mail and telephone communications. We simply intend, by this amendment, to bring current technology into compliance with the technology that was covered previously by this prohibition. Internet gambling is spreading exponentially. It approaches nearly $1 billion of annual revenue; 140 web sites currently operate on the Internet. It will be, as my colleague from Arizona indicated in his comments, a multibillion-dollar industry by the turn of the century. 
Why have the States' attorneys general approached us and asked us to enact this legislation? What vice exists with respect to Internet gambling that does not exist with respect to regulated gaming in the various forms the States have chosen to adopt? 
First of all is access. Whether one favors gaming or one has a strong religious or moral view opposed to gaming, I believe that all would acknowledge that gaming ought to be an adult recreational activity--underscoring the word `adult.' When one accesses the Internet and the various web sites that are currently on the Internet, there is no means--no means to enforce the age of that individual who is accessing the Internet. We all know from our children and grandchildren that today's youngsters enjoy a proficiency and sophistication, if you will, in terms of their ability to surf the net, to understand the world of computers. It is very easy--very easy for very young children to gain access to the Internet and thereby to participate in Internet gambling. 
I repeat, whether one supports the open casino style of gaming that Nevada has legalized for more than six decades, or takes the more restrictive view that the policymakers of the States of Hawaii and Utah have adopted, and that is to permit none, no one can justify access to a gaming experience to young children who may be 12, 13, or 14 years of age. And there is no way to enforce limited access to the Internet and to limit it to only those who are adults. 
Second, let me make the point that in those States that have chosen to adopt, and those tribes that have adopted forms of gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, there is or ought to be mechanisms in place that make sure that the individuals who are licensed to operate those games have been carefully screened for both integrity, in terms of their records, and suitability. Nobody is permitted, in the State of Nevada, for example, to operate a gaming activity unless he or she, or its corporate officers, have been carefully screened by the State Gaming Control Board and ultimately approved by the State Gaming Commission. 
When you participate in a gaming experience in States that permit some form of gaming, it is regulated. You know the individual operators of the game. In the world of cyberspace, you know not with whom you are communicating. Nobody, Mr. President--I repeat, nobody--has screened those individuals in terms of background, who they are, in terms of their track record, their integrity or their suitability. You are, in effect, participating in a gaming experience in which you do not know who the people are who are running that particular web site. 
No. 3: the actual virtual gaming experience itself. Every gaming device that is made available in my own State for customers to participate in has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Gaming Commission to make sure that the device provides a reasonable and fair opportunity for the player to win, so that the game is not rigged, so that under no circumstances could the player win. None of us is naive enough not to recognize that the odds clearly favor the house. That is not my point. But the game of chance is an honest one. Participants, players, have an opportunity to win, and, indeed, many of them do. 
In the world of cyberspace, no one, but no one, has regulated that particular device that is being offered. There is no way for the player to know whether that virtual game is rigged in such a way that it is impossible for him or her to win under any circumstance. 
Finally, assuming for the sake of argument that one does participate and does win, how do you know whether anybody is going to be around when you come to collect the money? 
Mr. President, the Internet and the e-mail system is filled with dozens and dozens of people who have had experiences that highlight the point I am seeking to make this evening. I will not impose upon the patience of this Chamber to cite all of them, but a couple of them, I think, are illustrative and make the point. 
This is in a communication dated April 1 of this year by an individual who had participated in Internet gambling. I quote from his letter: 
I tried both of the above online casinos, and I'm beginning to notice a strange trend. When I played the games offline just for practice, the odds seemed to conform, but when I played online for real money, the win-loss ratio seemed very disproportionate compared to what they were when I was playing offline. Of course, I may have been just very unlucky playing online, but I'm strongly suspicious. I suspect that the odds for real play and the practice are quite different. I think these guys cheat somehow, and I've given up on them and online gambling altogether. Of course, I can't prove that they cheat. Who can? 
Mr. President, the point being, there is no regulator who, first of all, makes a determination as to who ought to have a web site for gaming activity, no regulator to determine whether or not the game of chance itself is a fair and honest one, and no regulator to make sure that, indeed, if the player prevails, he or she is able to collect. 
Let me cite one other which I think is illustrative, and this is a letter dated April 30 of this year. The writer goes on to observe: 
This is what you find at the bottom of the barrel-- 
Referring to the individual letter writer's experience on 
the Internet with his or her gambling experience. 
Presumably from New Hampshire, these guys set up an online bingo site that went belly up in a hurry. The most popular theory is that they had fewer players than anticipated and couldn't afford to pay off the winners, so they pulled off a disappearing act that would turn David Copperfield green with envy. 
That is the point that I am seeking to make. 
The point needs to be made that Internet gambling is a bad bet. It is an unregulated activity in which children have access to the gaming experience, and it is not an enterprise that is subject to regulation. That is why the States' attorneys general have asked us to impose this. 
Let me simply say that I believe that the prohibition needs to be across the board. My amendment makes one exception--and perhaps some of my colleagues have participated--and that is in the so-called fantasy sports leagues or educational games that operate over the Internet. Some have estimated that nearly 1 million Americans participate in fantasy or rotisserie sports teams on the Internet ranging from baseball to golf to auto racing. 
The second-degree amendment which I have offered to the first-degree amendment of the Senator from Arizona will simply indicate that that kind of activity which exists will not be prohibited under the provisions of this legislation. 
Finally, let me say that Internet gambling currently is in violation of the law. States' attorneys general and U.S. attorneys are trying to combat it, but, Mr. President, they need our help, and the enforcement tool or mechanism that they need is in the legislation offered by the junior Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Nevada. I hope that all of my colleagues will support this, irrespective of their own personal views toward gaming itself. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make very clear what is at issue here. If you oppose kids gambling on the Internet, then you are with Senator Kyl and the Senator from Nevada. We think that is a disastrous policy for American families. Your 10-year-old child can dial up a site on the web and gamble without you knowing it and without any ability to control it. So the Kyl-Bryan amendment opposes Internet gambling in America for everyone. 
Now, if that policy makes sense to you, and I think it makes sense for American families, then you have to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Idaho who says, in effect, Internet gambling should be prohibited for everyone except Indian tribes. 
Now, what logic is that that a child in Utah, which is prohibited from all forms of gaming, would be able to surf the web, access the Indian gaming site in Idaho, and be able to participate over the Internet. That makes no sense at all. I think most families, if they were tuned into the debate tonight, would say Kyl and Bryan are correct, we don't want our kids on the Internet, and we believe it ought to be prohibited. 
Senator Craig's amendment would emasculate that by saying the Indian tribes have an exception. No compact in America, none entered into by any Governor, any State or Indian tribe, authorizes Internet gambling. None. And no court in America, State or Federal, has ever held that Indian tribes are entitled to gamble on the Internet at such web sites. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has enabled millions of individuals across the country to purchase their first home and realize a piece of the American dream. 
I know this firsthand because my wife and I bought our first home when we were newly married with an FHA loan. 
There are many families today who would not own their home if it were not for the Federal Housing Administration's single family insurance program. 
The Federal Housing Administration was created to promote home ownership and stimulate the construction of housing by encouraging financial institutions to make loans to those who did not have adequate resources for a down payment. 
Since then, FHA has evolved into a program which gives first-time home buyers and under served borrowers greater access to mortgage credit. 
It is a financially sound system that not only works well, but works well at no cost to the taxpayer. 
The state of Nevada is the fastest growing state in the country and, as in many states, the real estate activity in Nevada is an important aspect of our economy. 
As our population grows, the demand for new housing increases. 
And as we all know, the cost of new homes in many cases is more expensive than existing ones. 
In Nevada, for example, many first-time home buyers rely on FHA to purchase a home. 
But as new homes are being built and as the cost of housing rapidly increases in my state, more and more families are unable to secure home ownership. 
They simply cannot afford the cost of a home under a conventional loan. 
This not only hurts the economy, but it strips away any hope of owning a home. 
The loan limit which Senators Bond and Mikulski agreed to in the VA/HUD appropriations bill would give more first-time home buyers the opportunity to afford a home who would otherwise not be able to. 
The FHA loan limit would increase the high limit from $170,362 to $197,620 and the lower limit from $86,317 to $109,032. 
Although the loan limit does not go as far as the President's proposal, which I supported, I believe this proposal is a fair compromise that would benefit our society as a whole. 
Let me be clear about the importance to raise both the floor and the ceiling of the FHA loan limit: 
First, raising the FHA loan limit would increase home ownership opportunities. 
Over the years, the new home portion of FHA's activity has diminished to roughly 6 percent, and only 5 percent of all new homes are now financed with FHA-insured mortgages. 
This decrease in FHA's role in the market for new homes is clearly a result of the current mortgage loan limits. 
HUD estimates that higher loan limits would enable approximately 60,000 more families--who have been cut out of the market--each year to purchase a home. 
Second, FHA is critical to first-time home buyers. 
Thousands of families with the ability to make the mortgage payments on a home cannot make the purchase because they lack the up front capital required. Raising the FHA loan limits would give them the chance that they do not have under current home finance options. 
Third, raising the limit would enhance FHA's ability to spread risk. 
The FHA insurance fund is a financially healthy program and HUD believes that the fund will become stronger when the loan limits are raised. 
Both Price Waterhouse and the General Accounting Office note that higher value loans perform better than lower valued loans and that the rate of default is lower for larger loans than for smaller loans. 
OMB estimates that raising the loan limits would create excess revenues of $228 million. 
Finally, raising the limit would raise revenue for the Treasury and would improve the Government's finances; approximately $225 million in annual revenue would be generated. 
Arguments against raising the loan limits are weak and do not live up to the true reality of what is in the best interest of the American people. 
Some argue that the very group FHA was created to serve will be pushed along the wayside if loan limits are increased. 
Let me remind you that raising the loan limit will increase the average FHA loan amount by 4.2 percent--from $85,500 to $89,109 and the average income by 3.8 percent--from $40,800 to $42,350. 
The increase would enable more families to buy a home. 
It would not take away from the underserved population. 
In fact, since 1992, when the FHA loan limits increased from $124,875 to $170,362, the share of FHA mortgages to low-income borrowers increased from 15.7 percent to 20.1 percent. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me today and support the increase in the FHA loan limit to $197,000 and reject any measure that threatens the opportunity for many first-time home buyers across the country to own a home.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee and I are introducing `the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.' Commercial Web sites are currently collecting and disseminating personal information collected from children that may compromise their safety and most certainly invades their privacy. This legislation will ensure that commercial Web sites that collect and use personal information from children will have safeguards in place to protect you and your family. 
The Internet is quickly becoming an significant force in the lives of our children as it moves swiftly into homes and classrooms around the country. Currently more than 3 million children under the age of 18 are online and the number is expected to grow to 15 million by the turn of the century. 
I think all would agree that proficiency with the Internet is a critical and vital skill that will be necessary for academic achievement in the next century. The benefits of the Internet are extraordinary. Reference information such as news, weather, sports, stock quotes, movie reviews, encyclopedia and online airline fares are readily available. Users can conduct transactions such as stock trading, make travel arrangements, bank, and shop online. 
Millions of people communicate through electronic mail to family and friends around the world, and others use the public message boards to make new friends and share common interests. As an educational and entertainment tool, users can learn about virtually any topic or take a college course. 
Unfortunately, the same marvelous advances in computer and telecommunication technology that allow our children to reach out to new resources of knowledge and cultural experiences are also leaving them unwittingly vulnerable to exploitation and harm by deceptive marketers and criminals. 
Earlier this spring, I held several meetings in Nevada with educators and parents' representatives to alert them of some of the deceptive practices found on the Internet. Representatives of the FBI and Federal Trade Commission informed Nevadans about some of the Internet's pitfalls. I found it extremely informative and enlightening and to some extent frightening. 
You may be startled to learn what information other people are collecting about you and your family 
may have a profound impact upon their privacy and, indeed, their safety. 
Once what may seem to be harmless information has made its way onto the Internet, there is no way of knowing what uses may be put to that information. 
Senator McCain and I wrote to the FTC asking them to investigate online privacy issues. Recently, the FTC completed the survey of a number of web sites and found that 89 percent of children's sites collect personal information from children, and less than 10 percent of the sites provide for parental control over the collection and use of this personal information. 
I was, frankly, surprised to learn the kinds of information these web sites are collecting from our children. Some were asking where the child went to school, what sports he or she liked, what siblings they had, their pet's name, what kind of time they had after school alone without the supervision of parents. 
Others were collecting personal financial information like what the family income was, does the family own stocks or certificates of deposit, did their grandparents give them any financial gifts? 
Web sites were using games, contests, and offers of free merchandise to entice children to give them exceedingly personal and private information about themselves and their families. Some even used cartoon characters who asked children for personal information, such as a child's name and address and e-mail address, date of birth, telephone number, and Social Security number. 
Much of this information appears to be harmless, but companies are attempting to build a wealth of information about you and your family without an adult's approval--a profile that will enable them to target and to entice your children to purchase a range of products. 
The Internet gives marketers the capability of interacting with your children and developing a relationship without your knowledge. 
Where can this interactive relationship go? Will your child be receiving birthday cards and communications with online cartoon characters for particular products? 
Senator McCain and I believe there must be safeguards against the online collecting of information from children without a parent's knowledge or consent. If a child answers a phone and starts answering questions, a parent automatically becomes suspicious and asks who they are talking to. When a child is on the Internet, parents often have no knowledge of whom their child is interacting. 
That is why we are introducing legislation that would require the FTC to come up with rules to govern these kind of activities. The FTC's rules would require commercial web sites to:

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about my amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that was adopted last night by the Senate. This amendment requires the Secretary of Agriculture to make important information about the Market Access Program (MAP) and its expenditures available to the Congress and to the General Accounting Office (GAO). 
It is no secret that I am no fan of this program, Mr. President. I would have rather eliminated funding for the Market Access Program completely, as we attempted to do with an earlier amendment. Unfortunately, this wasteful program's corporate handouts survived, but the reporting amendment adopted by the Senate will at least give auditors the tools they need to thoroughly investigate the impact of this program. 
As I pointed out earlier on the floor of the Senate, the claims that are continually used to justify MAP and extend its life have been called into question by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in a study published last year. The report, which was requested by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, John Kasich, evaluated claims that MAP benefits the U.S. economy, boosts the agriculture sector, and helps counter competitor nations' agricultural export assistance programs. 
The GAO could not find evidence to authenticate any of these claims. 
In fact, the GAO assailed the lack of accountability within the Market Access Program and the general lack of clear and complete data available for their analysts. 
With major questions left unanswered, the GAO has been unable to produce an honest and useful evaluation of the program that could help Congress and program administrators choose policies that will provide the most benefits to the United States. 
In the conclusion to its report on the Market Access Program, GAO suggested that `Congress may wish to direct USDA to develop more systematic information on the potential strategic value of U.S. export assistance programs.' 
That is exactly what this amendment will do. 
My amendment requires the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, to submit a report that analyzes the costs and benefits of the program in compliance with OMB guidelines and treats resources as fully deployed, two of the GAO's main criticisms of earlier program analyses for MAP and other export assistance programs. 
The amendment would require the USDA to estimate the impact on the agriculture sector as well as on U.S. consumers, while also considering the costs and benefits of alternative uses of the funds currently allocated to MAP. 
Another requirement calls for an analysis of increases in exports, controlling for outside influences, such as exchange rates and international market conditions, that can have a great influence on international trade. 
Finally, the Department is required to evaluate the sustainability of promotion efforts in the absence of government subsidies, an important question that has not been asked throughout the life of these programs. 
Again, Mr. President, I would have liked to eliminate the funding for MAP altogether and turn to other, proven programs to increase the strength of our agriculture sector, but this amendment moves in the right direction by opening up the inner workings of MAP and making this program more accountable. 
I am hopeful that using these recommendations to gather additional useful information in a report to Congress will finally establish what benefits can truly be attributed to MAP and will help us make informed decisions about this program.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make some general observations. This is an area that I have had an interest in for a number of years. We have debated it many times on the floor, and I say to my friends from the agricultural heartland of America that I am not unmindful that in some of the agricultural regions of our country, there is real economic crisis out there, particularly in the plains States. 
I am not unsympathetic to the concerns of farmers. Indeed, I intend to be supportive of many of the amendments that will be offered to provide assistance to farmers who face real economic crises for a variety of reasons, many of which I suggest have probably been debated on the floor during the course of this appropriations bill. 
Having said that, I want to talk about a program that, in my judgment, provides no real help to America's farmers or agricultural producers and, instead, continues to subsidize some of the largest corporations in America in terms of their advertising dollars. I believe this is a wholly inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars. As I will point out during the course of this discussion, the analysis of the Market Access Program by the General Accounting Office, just released, is a definitive analysis of the efficacy of this program. 
Notwithstanding those who have advocated on its behalf and those who continue to defend it, the GAO report reveals that in spite of repeated attempts to make this program accountable, no credible evidence could be found to support the claims that the Market Access Program benefits the economy. That is why a broad range of organizations have been joined in opposition. These are groups that cover the political spectrum, from right to left. Among them are: Americans for Tax Reform, Capital Watch, the Cato Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Friends of the Earth, the National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. All of these organizations have called for the elimination of this program. Many of these organizations have joined together in a `stop corporate welfare' effort that named the Market Access Program among a select group of the most blatant of Federal handouts. 
The Green Scissors report, which recommends cutting programs that hurt both taxpayers and the environment, has also cited the Market Access Program as a waste of money.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, it is just not outside groups that are calling for the elimination of this program. The Market Access Program was specifically targeted for elimination in the fiscal year 1999 Republican budget resolution. This provision was included in the legislation passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 57-41 on April 2 of this year. 
Unfortunately, however, like Lazarus, this program seems to rise from the dead every year and is currently authorized to receive some $90 million in fiscal year 1999. 
The Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, is a branch of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and it distributes this $90 million that has previously been authorized in three different categories. One is a direct contribution to private companies. Two is a contribution that is made to industry associations which, in turn, makes grants to members within that association. And the third category is cooperatives. These moneys are frequently used for the promotion of brand-name products, specifically identified household names in America, as well as generic commodities overseas. 
So we have private companies that receive money directly from the funding source--industry associations and cooperatives. 
In spite of numerous reforms that we have debated and enacted in recent years in efforts to limit the aid provided to giant corporations, millions of dollars continue to flow to large, well-established producers, agribusinesses to subsidize their advertising budget. 
Let me again make the point. 
As part of the ongoing debate that we have had annually on this program, we have been able to persuade the Congress that with respect to the direct contributions made to private companies that are providing some of the largest organizations and companies in the world with money to supplement their advertising accounts, it simply cannot be defended and is an outrageous use of taxpayer dollars. So we created a small business category that is eligible to receive the private company distributions. That is currently part of the law. 
But that only tells part of the story, because as you will see, the top recipients of the Market Access Program--this is the specific brand of the product that you can see here--continue to be some of the largest companies in America: Sunkist Growers, $2,594,000; Blue Diamond Nuts, $4,419,000; Welch's Foods, $707,000; Sunsweet, $616,000; Ernest & Julio Gallo, $598,000; Tyson Foods, $440,000; and Ocean Spray, $320,000. 
The way that they have been able to effectively circumvent the limitation that this money should be made available only to small businesses is that industry associations and cooperatives that receive the money directly from the Foreign Agricultural Service can in turn make grants to members of the association or to the cooperative members themselves. So that is how we continue to see these substantial amounts of money that continue to flow into these large companies. 
Proponents of the program will justify this corporate giveaway by pointing to various studies that exalt the benefits reaped by these advertising campaigns, but none of the studies cited, nor the benefits that are assigned to this program, can be authenticated. 
Mr. President, in the course of the debate on this floor over the years, we have seen near magical benefits attributed to this program--claims that each dollar of spending through the Market Access Program yields about $16 in new agricultural exports in addition to thousands and thousands of jobs. Those have been the arguments essentially that have been used to oppose the elimination of this program. 
First of all, if this analysis were correct, perhaps what we ought to do is put more money into this program and in effect have our Head Start youngsters participate in this program in order to achieve these dramatic `multiplier affects' that the advocates and defenders of this program have asserted for it. 
I want to make a further point: The figure that is used for these multiplier numbers is data taken from a 1995 inagency study of the Market Access Program that has drawn much criticism from GAO. 
The GAO found that the analysis on which this and other fanciful claims are based is flawed and does not follow standard cost-benefit guidelines--guidelines that are recommended by the Office of Management and Budget. 
The GAO's September report--this is the report that was 
released in September of this last year--has found that the data that has been used and the methodology does not support the conclusions that advocates of this program attribute to this Market Access Program. 
This report, which was completed at the request of the Budget Committee in the House and its chairman, could not authenticate any of these claims that have been made. Here is just a brief summary of what the GAO concluded. 
First, the GAO said there is no credible evidence that the Market Access Program has expanded employment and output, or reduced the trade and budget deficits. 
Second, it goes on to say that increases in farm employment and income cannot be attributed to Market Access Program spending. 
Finally, that the Market Access Program is not an effective counterweight for the export programs of other nations. 
That is another argument that I am sure that we will hear--that other countries are helping to subsidize their agricultural industry in providing a number of export subsidies to assist those. 
But, as the GAO has reported, this program has not been an effective counterweight to the export programs designed by other countries. 
I must say that this hardly is a ringing endorsement for continued expenditures for this program. That is, putting aside the philosophical objections for a moment, there is really no evidence that the money that we are spending--$90 million--accomplishes a thing. 
Let me suggest that the Market Access Program has another questionable aspect to it; that is, what is the justification for continuing to subsidize promotional efforts for well-known brand-name products that do not receive Federal assistance? These companies that I have cited, Sunkist, Blue Diamond Nuts, Welch's Foods, Tyson Foods, and Ocean Spray, are fine companies, are highly successful companies and are huge companies in terms of their size. What justification is there to use taxpayer dollars to support in effect augmenting or increasing the kinds of advertising dollars that these companies clearly have the ability on their own to do? They know how to make a judgment as to how their advertising budgets should be spent. That is a private sector determination. The Government has no business, in my judgment, taking hard-earned taxpayer dollars and saying to each of these companies we are going to give you an additional $2.5 million or $1.5 million to add to your budget. I have an objection to that philosophically. 
Moreover, when the GAO concluded that these dollars that we have spent over the years really have not accomplished anything, I think it is just totally indefensible. 
It is true, Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, that some positive changes have been implemented in the program in an effort to focus more effort on small business and new-to-export producers. However, one-third of all MAP promotions are still brand names. They are product-specific promotions identifying a particular company, and not a generic product that is being exported abroad. 
I think when you look at how the money is actually spent, notwithstanding the well-intentioned efforts to focus this program on smaller companies, that we have really failed in that objective. 
The top 10 brand-name promotion grants awarded by USDA, the United States Department of Agriculture, in fiscal year 1997 includes some of the well-known products that most Americans probably recognize from U.S.-based advertising. 
These are the companies. 
My feeling is that I think it is very hard--I think it is impossible--to justify spending taxpayer dollars. Sunkist, for example, a company that employs between 500 and 900 people, and posted sales of over $1 billion, received $5 million in Federal advertising assistance in 1996 and 1997. 
What in heaven's world are the taxpayers doing subsidizing the advertising budget of a company with sales exceeding $1 billion annually? You simply can't justify that. 
Welch's Foods, another fine product, with over 1,000 employees, rang up more than $550 million in sales, yet was awarded over $1.5 million over the past 2 years as part of this program. 
These examples illustrate what I have been saying for a number of years--that this program is a waste of money and public funds should not be used to underwrite private corporate activity. 
Proponents of this program will point out accurately that in the last few years, the largest number of awards have gone to small businesses and cooperatives. Much of this is due to the changes to the program that were passed--with the support of the ranking member of the Agricultural Appropriations Committee on the Senate floor--that gave preference to small and nonprofit applicants. 
However, it is important to note that the other types of MAP recipients, the cooperatives and the industry associations, as we pointed out, do not limit the contributions that they make to their members based upon size. That is how we have these rather large companies receiving a staggering amount of public assistance. That is why you will not see these names on MAP's award list. Large companies still receive funds through their associations. In fiscal year 1997, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, the Kentucky Distillers' Association and the Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council passed through funds to M&M/Mars, Maker's Mark Distillery, and General Mills, Inc., respectively, to conduct name brand promotions overseas. 
Finally, let me note in this context that we take a look at the names of the top 10 awards for brand name promotions--the top 10 for brand name promotions. It is interesting to note that small businesses received only $825,000 of the $7,816,000 that went to these 10 applicants. In contrast, the top two name brand recipients, Sunkist and Blue Diamond, received more than $4 million, more than half of that $7.8 million total. 
We have attempted to tighten the program, with limited funding, to change the definition of preferred participants, but the same large and well-known recipients show up on the MAP award list year after year. 
Many of the problems we discussed 5 and 6 years ago continue to go unresolved, and this recent report by the GAO still cannot verify the claims made by the USDA to justify MAP. 
The distribution, Mr. President, of millions of dollars of public funds to private businesses for self-promotion does not win any commonsense awards, but continued spending on such a program without confirmation of the program's competitiveness is an unforgivable abuse of public funds. 
Before I close my comments, I want to put this program in some perspective, because I expect many of my colleagues will come to the floor to defend this program that takes $90 million of taxpayer dollars and uses it for foreign advertising. 
Mr. President, the MAP cannot offset foreign competitors' export subsidies, because it does not make U.S. products more affordable. It is an advertising subsidy, not an export subsidy. We need to ensure that our agricultural programs provide real and measurable benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers, especially as farmers are facing falling prices, and MAP's benefits do not in any way meet this test. 
Perhaps a little history on this program is in order to give some perspective: 
The Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program was authorized as part of the 1985 Food Security Act to reverse the decline in U.S. agricultural exports and specifically to counter the unfair trade practices of foreign competitors. 
Unlike products promoted under MAP, only commodities adversely affected by unfair foreign trade practices were eligible for funding under TEA. This restriction continued until 1994, but was eliminated as part of the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round trade agreements. So, while a link between USDA export promotion aid and foreign trade practices once existed, it is no longer a requirement for MAP participants. 
Even when the program was still targeted at unfair trade practices, it was prone to wasteful spending on behalf of huge corporations such as McDonalds, Campbell Soup and a host of others. After a critical audit by GAO, the program's name was changed to the Market Promotion Program as part of the 1990 farm bill. 
Then, after two more reports critical of the program, its name was again changed in 1996, this time to the Market Access Program. At that time, Congress was under extreme pressure to end the corporate handout, and some positive and significant changes to the program's management were proposed and adopted: 
USDA was directed to stop awarding funds to foreign companies; Participation was restricted to small businesses, cooperatives, and trade associations; and companies were required to certify that funds were not merely substituting for private marketing funds that were already being spent. 
I wish that I could say that these changes have ensured that the program provides a fair return to the American people. Unfortunately, even with these restrictions written into law, millions continue to flow to large corporations through associations and cooperatives with no real assurance that the funds are not used to replace private advertising dollars. 
These criticisms were restated by the GAO in the report released last fall following yet another GAO investigation, requested by Representative John Kasich, into the effectiveness of the Market Access Program and the claims made about its success. 
In this key report, the GAO discredits the analysis used by the USDA in reports that claimed that MAP has a significant impact on the economy, the agricultural sector, and U.S. trade efforts. The GAO audit found fault with each of these conclusions because each was based on the agency's use of flawed methodology and incomplete evaluations of the program's costs and benefits. 
The GAO leveled additional changes at the program's management, pointing out enduring problems that Congress has tried to fix in the past. For example, in spite of the requirement that companies use MAP funds to supplement, not supplant, their own advertising spending, GAO found no way to confirm that MAP funds were indeed being used for unique expenditures. The 1993 reconciliation bill required applicants to verify that MAP funds would not replace their own advertising dollars, but this requirement is largely unconfirmed by USDA officials and verification is left up to MAP applicants. 
It is also difficult to establish that MAP's stated goal of introducing firms to new markets is being met. Major questions remain unanswered, such as: when have companies or associations had `enough' assistance? Some firms will have been participating in the program for 13 years before the 5-year `graduation' requirements (instituted in 1994) will begin to take effect. The USDA currently does not have a standard method for deciding when their own program goals are reached, so business interests or associations can stay in the program without regard to their NEED for funds to open new markets. 
At the center of the GAO's criticisms of MAP's effectiveness is the faulty economic analysis used by USDA to make its case for the program. GAO reported that USDA's flawed evaluations made it extremely difficult to analyze MAP's contributions to the economy, because the program analysis for MAP does not conform with the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) agency guidelines for cost-benefit analysis. These guidelines are used by agencies to construct a uniform standard for evaluating programs' performance as required under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Without using a standard method of evaluating various government programs, it would be nearly impossible to judge any program's effectiveness. 
OMB instructs agencies, when analyzing the impact of any program, to assume that resources are `fully employed' [`Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,' OMB Circular No. A-94, sec 6b(3) (Oct. 29, 1992)]. These guidelines are in place to ensure that, in keeping with the implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act, each agency follows a uniform framework when evaluating costs and benefits of its programs. This framework includes the assumption of fully employed resources. 
However, in its 1995 analysis of the Market Access Program, USDA did not adhere to the OMB cost-benefit guidelines and assumed that program resources would otherwise be unemployed. Clearly, it is not accurate, in today's economy, to assume that the funds designated for MAP, or any program, would have no benefit, no alternate use, if otherwise deployed in the economy. 
Put another way, USDA took the untenable postion that the resources that went into MAP could not yield benefits to the economy through other uses, such as tax breaks for American families, investment in education, or paying down the debt. 
USDA also assumes that MAP-promoted agricultural products would not be exported at all in the absence of this program, which implies that the private sector would not pursue these export opportunities without MAP assistance. This premise holds that on the one hand, these markets would be unprofitable without help from the federal government, but on the other hand, these same markets bring in high returns on promotion expenditures. If the returns on investment are indeed as great as the agency holds, why would the private sector not undertake its own promotional activities? 
For a recipient like Sunkist, whose homepage on the Internet boasts that `Sunkist is the 43rd most recognized name brand in the United States and the 47th most recognized in the world,' it becomes clear that this program is wasting scarce federal dollars subsidizing an already highly-successful company's advertising budget. 
Finally, in its 1995 report USDA also assumes that all of the workers and farmers whose labor and output is associated with MAP-promoted exports would be completely unemployed were it not for the MAP program. Under this premise, USDA calculates these workers' employment and income as benefits generated by MAP, crediting the program with economic expansion and increased tax revenues. 
Mr. President, any federal program evaluated under this same set of assumptions would appear to generate income. This type of accounting is not permitted for other programs, and should not be permitted to stand here. The result is that USDA's analysis of MAP includes exaggerated estimates of the program's worth that are misleading but are nonetheless often quoted by proponents of the program. 
Let me give you some examples of the overblown gains attributed to MAP as a result of the department's faulty analysis. According to information included in the USDA's 1999 Performance Plan and the Foreign Agriculture Service's five-year strategic plan, the $90 million annual allocation for MAP, through a multiplier effect, results in $5 billion in agricultural exports, expands the national economy by $12 billion, and creates 86,500 jobs. And that is jsut the 1997 impact. 
It sounds too good to be true, and it is. 
These incredible returns are the result of USDA's `free lunch' analysis--an irrational conclusion that MAP benefits the economy, based on faulty assumptions that federal and private resources have no alternate use or impact on the economy. 
Another major claim made in support of MAP is that these funds are needed to counteract the export assistance of our foreign competitors. The GAO report finds this claim, like the others, unreliable because of the lack of verifiable information about foreign competitors' export assistance activities. 
We often hear about the large amounts of money that foreign competitors pump into export subsidies, and how important it is to make U.S. crops competitive in foreign markets or risk being locked out of these markets altogether. This argument is irrelevant to any discussion about MAP, however, because unlike USDA's export subsidy programs which lower the prices of U.S. crops abroad, the Market Access Program is not an export subsidy, it is a promotion subsidy, and does not lower prices of U.S. goods in foreign markets. 
Furthermore, while it is true that MAP's focus at its creation was countering unfair trading practices employed by our competitors in overseas markets, this is no longer the case. As I mentioned earlier, MAP's focus on matching competitors' moves was removed when the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round agreements was approved in 1994, allowing MAP funds to be used for general export promotion purposes as the Foreign Agricultural Service sees fit. This change, combined with a lack of firsthand knowledge about foreign export activities, led the GAO to conclude that claims about MAP's effectiveness in countering other nations' export assistance cannot be verified. 
Another question that has been raised about this program is whether its export promotion subsidies are undertaken by other programs at USDA. The Congressional Research Service, in a February 1997 report, raises this question in relation to the Foreign Market Development Program (FMD), which has been around since 1954. The FMD program is much like the MAP except that it is focused on developing foreign markets for U.S. commodities, as opposed to name-brand and processed exports. Therefore, its jointly-funded activities are aimed more at technical assistance and market research rather than advertising and other consumer-oriented promotions. However, unlike MAP, funding levels for FMD have remained under $50 million annually, and activities have not grown to include brand-name promotions. 
While these two programs take a similar approach to different markets, there has been very little analysis of which type of promotion is more effective. It would be helpful to be able to compare MAP's track record with the results attributed to FMD, but this information has not been compiled by the USDA. Nor has there been a study to simply evaluate whether generic or branded promotions are more successful in promoting exports, and where these efforts are most successful. 
Mr. President, there is just not enough evidence out there which backs up the claims we have all heard about the Market Access Program. I can think of no other federal program that we allow to receive funds without a rigorous examination of the costs and benefits associated with the government's investment. We demand this kind of analysis even for D&D programs which often have uncertain future outcomes and benefits that are difficult to forecast. 
We must ask ourselves, if a policy of underwriting the advertising expenses of large producers and corporate interests makes sense when we are cutting back on funding for domestic food security and important research initiatives. We cannot justify spending one more dime on this unproven program, and this view is shared by a long list of government watchdog and consumers groups representing a broad range of beliefs: Americans for Tax Reform, Capitol Watch, the CATO Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Friends of the Earth, National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
I urge all of you to take a long, hard look at this program's track record and vote to end the waste of taxpayer dollars on foreign advertising and promotion. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I find myself in agreement with at least the concern that is expressed by the able chairman of the subcommittee. There is no question that certain agricultural segments in America face a real crisis. As I said at the outset of our discussion on this amendment, I am not unmindful, I am not unsympathetic, of these concerns and, indeed, I expect to support a number of proposals that will be advanced to assist American agriculture as it moves through this crisis period. 
I do not deny that the decline has demanded, that the turmoil in Asia has created a problem, that there are some weather-related phenomena, that, indeed, there may be some competitive practices by those who compete in the world's international agricultural markets that may be decidedly unfair to American agriculture. I am concerned about that as a citizen and am prepared to support measures that effectively deal with that issue and help American farmers. I am for that. 
I recognize that, as the myth of this program has taken on legendary proportions, it is an article of faith, unshaken by factual analysis, that somehow the Market Access Program provides additional farm employment, expands exports internationally, is a significant contributor to the growth of the American economy, and somehow is an effective counterweight to some of the unfair competitive practices which American agriculture faces abroad. 
Mr. President, the problem with that is that each of those arguments has been analyzed in considerable detail, not by the Senator from Nevada but by the GAO in its most recent report of September 1997. 
Very simply, what the GAO report concludes is that none of the claims, none of the assertions made, can be verified or authenticated--none; none. The GAO report goes to the heart of the argument that, notwithstanding this mythic epic that seems to have arisen that suggests that this program is indispensable to American agriculture, the GAO report says, `Look, none of that, none of that can be verified.' That is the basic premise here. 
Yes, I want to be supportive and helpful to American agriculture in its time of crisis, but how can you support a program that in 10 years has cost the American taxpayer $2.3 billion? 
Let me make it clear--and this is not the subject of debate today, and the Senator from Nevada certainly will yield to the Senator from Mississippi in terms of his expertise in agricultural programs--but so none of my colleagues is somehow under the impression that this Market Access Program which I seek to eliminate strikes at the core of what we are trying to do to help American agriculture, let me point out that in this same 10-year period that we spent $2.3 billion on a program which the GAO says does not do what it is intended that it does, or at least it cannot verify or authenticate it, we have spent $9 billion on export subsidies, $7.8 billion on food aid, $53.1 billion in loan guarantees. We have tried to deal with some of the issues which American agriculture faces in the international marketplace. 
Point No. 1: If nothing else is taken out of this debate, the GAO says this program, notwithstanding the intensity and the passion that its advocates share for it, simply doesn't do the things that the advocates contend. Point No. 1. 
The second point that I think needs to be raised, even if one conceded for the sake of argument--and I do not and the GAO does not--how can you continue to justify paying $2.5 million to the good folks at Sunkist? How do we justify paying $1.5 million to the good folks at Blue Diamond Nuts? These are sophisticated, highly effective American companies whose products are world class, and, notwithstanding the fact that none of these products are grown in my State, I think as Americans we take great pride in their success, and the fact these products are found in the storefronts in the markets of the world, that is wonderful, but how do we justify subsidizing with taxpayer dollars? These companies have advertising budgets of tens of millions of dollars--probably much more than that. So the American taxpayer is asked to write a check to subsidize these advertising accounts. 
This program is not an export subsidy, it is an advertising subsidy. The point I make in response to the point of my able colleague from Mississippi is, No. 1, the GAO says it doesn't accomplish what it says it is designed to accomplish; and, No. 2, the philosophical point, notwithstanding all of our attempts to reform this program that it ought to be confined--I don't think it ought to be in existence--to small companies, still when you look at the top 10 companies that receive these dollars, small businesses receive only $825,000 of the $7,816,000 that went to these top 10 applicants. 
Notwithstanding what we attempted to do in previous years, in effect, large companies continue to be the beneficiaries of a substantial amount of taxpayers' dollars to supplement their advertising accounts. 
My good friend and I have an honest difference of opinion. I think that is wrong. I am willing to work with and to support Members from agricultural States in trying to do something that makes sense, that works, that can be helpful, but at this point the GAO has concluded that none of the claims has any validity. I think it is very difficult to continue as we have for the last decade where we spent $2.3 billion on this program. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would simply make the point that all of the assertions and claims that have been made by the advocates for the Market Access Program have been considered by the GAO in a report released last September. They have rejected all of them. We have spent $2.3 billion in the last 10 years and the GAO concludes that they cannot establish any benefit of the program. Unfortunately, our attempt to reform the program does not prevent the largest businesses in America from continuing to have their advertising budgets supplemented to the tune of millions and millions of dollars--$5 million subsidizing the advertising budget of one of these large companies. 
I hope my colleagues will recognize that this is a program that simply does not work and support the Bryan amendment by voting against the motion to table.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me preface my comments by joining the senior Senator from Nebraska in commending my senior Senator from Nevada for his untiring efforts for taxpayers not only in Nevada, but across the country, in terms of his efforts on the earlier variations of the bill of rights and the strong support of the legislation that we are debating today and that will be signed into law very shortly by the President. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning as a member of the Senate Finance Committee to offer my strong support for this historic legislation. It has been a long time coming. It has been a difficult process, but it is clear that the American people will benefit greatly as a result of this legislation which will soon be signed into law by the President. 
None of us really enjoy paying our taxes. But the vast majority of Americans do make a good-faith effort to pay their fair share. And while the IRS will never be popular, the legislation that we will soon vote on will go a long way in providing fairness to taxpayers in their dealings with the IRS and will assist Commissioner Rossotti to meet his goals of making the IRS a more efficient and customer-oriented service. 
Mr. President, the American tax system is essentially one of voluntary compliance. And implicit in that relationship is a sense on the part of the taxpayer that he or she is receiving fair treatment. To the extent that that perception is diminished, it undermines the public confidence in our system, it reduces the level of tax compliance, and it creates problems for those of us who do comply with this system and who will be paying a disproportionate share, larger than our fair burden, for those who do not. 
So it is a responsibility of the Congress to make sure, in its oversight capacity and the laws which we enact, that the IRS operate in a fair, evenhanded way in dealing with the taxpayer. And I must say, as a result of the hearings that the chairman of the committee held, the abuses that were pointed out, in several instances, are rampant. And I will comment on those in just a moment. 
I think it is fair to put this in some perspective as well, and that is that the great majority of employees of the IRS are really very dedicated public servants. They try to do their very best in performing the duties that they have. Much of the criticism that is directed against them properly ought to be directed against us. It is the Congress that enacts the code, and it is by every standard extraordinarily complicated, complex. Each year that we seek to make improvements to the code, at the same time it is also fair to say that we add additional complexity to it. 
That having been said, that their job, being the IRS and the employees of that Service have a very difficult job, there is absolutely no excuse for the kind of conduct that we saw evidenced in the hearings that the chairman had this year and last year. That is totally unacceptable conduct. I believe that several of the reforms that are addressed here in this legislation will help to alleviate those kinds of conditions. 
In addition to the obvious problems that were pointed out in the hearings, other problems are a bit more subtle, but they are also damaging to the taxpayer. And that is poor and inefficient management, inadequate and outdated computer systems, or the corporate culture that we saw much evidence of--the view of the taxpayer as the adversary instead of the customer. That has been deeply entrenched. 
One example that comes to mind is the quota system. There had been an attempt, in previous legislation, to send clear, unmistakable direction to the IRS that a quota system is not to be employed. A quota system forces the revenue agent to look at a taxpayer who comes into his or her office, not as a customer who has a problem that needs to be dealt with, but as a quota, that is that he or she is to be viewed as an individual from 
which that revenue agent must collect a certain amount of dollars, much like a traffic cop who is told by his or her boss that some 15 or 20 tickets must be issued each day. And that is what creates this adversarial system. 
We thought that we had eliminated that practice and that abuse. But no sooner had the chairman convened the hearings last fall that I received in my office, from an employee in the IRS office in Las Vegas, an internal document that gave every appearance of being a quota. Those in charge asserted that it was not a quota, but in point of fact, clearly, the revenue agent was given the impression that each individual was to be assessed a certain amount of money in terms of additional tax to be brought in. And clearly implicit in that direction was the fact that that employee's future and career prospects with the Internal Revenue Service would be judged based upon his or her performance. Hence, this confrontational relationship that I described continued to be deeply ingrained as part of this culture. 
Now, those are not easy things to root out. I must say that Commissioner Rossotti and the interim director, in response to questions that I raised during the course of those hearings, reaffirmed the policy that no quota system would exist and that the practice which had been conducted in Las Vegas, and perhaps other district offices as well, was not to be continued. And to the best of my knowledge, there has been no indication that it has. 
However, I do think that one of the fundamental changes made in this piece of legislation--the creation of a citizen oversight board, involving six members from the private sector--can be very helpful in monitoring the kinds of activity which comes to our attention as Members of Congress and, hopefully, will be helpful in eliminating that practice. Although it does not have the pizzazz of some of the other provisions, I believe the power that we invest in the new Commissioner to make changes at the top level of management will also have some far-reaching consequences. 
It is clear that those who are steeped in this corporate culture, this deeply ingrained practice that I and others who have spoken on this issue have described, simply are unable to make that change, that the frame of mind that allows that to continue has been such a part of the daily operational conduct of the agency that in some instances at the top level individuals simply have to be replaced. 
I think it is important to point out that in Commissioner Rossotti we have the first Commissioner whose background is not tax accounting law, but he is an individual who is a businessman, not a lawyer, who has committed to provide the kind of management reforms that we need to change that corporate culture. So the powers that we give him to make those kinds of changes, which no previous Commissioner has had, I think will help to send a very powerful message at the top that this is not business as usual and that we want not only a more efficient and a more responsive agency, but we want an agency that eliminates the kinds of abuses that were provided during the course of the hearings. 
Some years back the Congress intended to provide an ombudsman, as it was initially called, later a Taxpayer Advocate, to represent the individual. Those intentions, I think, were well conceived. Indeed, in their implementation, I think an effort was made to create such a position. But in point of fact, individuals who were chosen to serve in this capacity came directly from the IRS, returned to the IRS, and because that individual's ultimate career plan in the IRS could be impacted by his or her performance as a Taxpayer Advocate, the Taxpayer Advocate Office did not achieve its desired purpose to provide independent representation and advocacy on behalf of the taxpayer. 
I believe in the legislation that will be signed into law, as a product of this bill, that we have created that kind of independence by making it clear that this is not an individual who can come directly from the IRS and immediately, upon completion of his or her tenure in the Office of Independent Advocate, once again continue a career path within the IRS. 
That independence, in fact, as well as perception, I think, will provide invaluable help to America's taxpayers. 
Much criticism is directed at the agency and much is warranted. Let me comment, in the interest of balance, on something that the agency has done an excellent job in doing and that is the implementation of telefiling. It is a paperless tax filing system. In 1997, nearly 5 million taxpayers took advantage of that by simply picking up their telephone and filing their return. Its calculation is done on the other end. It is paperless. It is fast. Those taxpayers who have a refund coming to them will receive that refund much more quickly than in the process in which one files a paper return that is processed. It also is less cumbersome for the IRS in terms of the paperwork which has been generated, thousands and thousands of different forms and millions and millions of returns. So it helps us achieve the goal of efficiency in terms of the IRS' response. 
I am pleased to note in 1998, nearly 6 million taxpayers took advantage of the telefiling. That is an increase of nearly 27 percent. Indeed, that is just the tip of the iceberg. The potential is significantly greater. Other types of electronic filing have also been developed. In 1997, we had about 14 million who filed electronically. In 1998, some 18 million. That is 28 percent. That also provides for a faster evaluation of the return, provides less opportunity for errors, for misdirected paperwork, and I think will be extremely helpful in providing the standard of service to which the American taxpayer is entitled. 
Among the more significant things, dramatically significant, is a shift in the burden of proof for taxpayers and small businesses when their dispute with the IRS reaches the Tax Court level. That shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS. That will be another significant change. Perhaps if there is any one change that more dramatically signals what we are trying to accomplish in this legislation in trying to provide fairness to the American people who are attempting to comply with a very complicated tax system, this is an indicator. 
Having practiced law in years past, I am not unmindful of a situation which innocent spouses are frequently victimized by the conduct of their spouses, oftentimes in the context of separation or divorce, in which the spouse involved in business is involved in either concealing or fraudulently filing a return, that return is jointly signed by the other spouse who has no involvement in the business and no culpability. The offending or culpable spouse is no longer available and the IRS turns to the innocent spouse. By any fair standard, that is conduct we should not endorse. An innocent spouse truly not involved, not culpable, should not be victimized by the conduct of his or her spouse. This legislation provides expanded benefits and protection for the innocent spouse. 
In addition, we do several other things. That is, we provide for additional authority to award litigation costs to taxpayers who prevail in court disputes with the IRS. It costs a great deal of money to engage counsel. Most American taxpayers are not in the position to afford that kind of expense. It is only fair when that taxpayer prevails that, indeed, the cost of the litigation be recovered in favor of the taxpayer. We send a very strong message that the kind of misconduct which was much in evidence during the hearings last year and this year is not to be tolerated. We say to the 
American taxpayer, to those who have been victimized by such conduct, that a cause of action for civil damages based on claims of negligence by IRS employees will now be available to such taxpayers. 
We improve taxpayers' rights during audits, collections, including prohibiting the IRS from seizing residences for deficiencies of under $5,000 and prohibiting the IRS from seizing a residence without a court order, increasing the availability of taxpayer assistance, reducing penalties for taxpayers making good-faith efforts. I think this might require an additional word of embellishment. 
For those taxpayers who for whatever reason have failed to pay their full amount of taxes due, who are on a schedule of payment, only to find that the compounding effect of penalties and fines makes it virtually impossible for them ever to reduce the amount of principal that is the original amount they failed to pay, nothing could be more frustrating, nothing could be more discouraging, and it is a disincentive to those taxpayers who say, look, I recognize I owe the money, but I don't have it all. Establish a schedule of payments so I can make my payments. We heard testimony of people who had paid for extended periods of time and after having made such payments really had not reduced their principal; if at all, very minimally. This legislation addresses such an issue, and I think will be an incentive and encouragement for taxpayers to, indeed, begin making payments and to see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. 
Greater disclosure and notice to taxpayers, including details of the computations of any penalties and interest due; more detailed explanations of the entire audit and collection process in the first deficiency notice; disclosure of taxpayers' rights at interviews with the IRS; disclosure of the criteria for examination--all part of the process to make one's visit to the IRS less of a mysterious and frightful experience, but to provide the taxpayer a broader understanding of the circumstances that bring him or her to the office--rationale for the deficiency, for any that is assessed, what that taxpayers' rights are in terms of responding. 
In sum, Mr. President, all of these provisions should result in a more efficient and friendly IRS in the future. 
I want to commend the chairman of our committee with whom I have had the great pleasure of working in this Congress as a newly appointed member to the Senate Finance Committee, the ranking member, the senior Senator from New York, and my colleague who sits to my right, the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Grassley and others, who have labored in the vineyards for many years to provide fairness to the Code. It has taken us a long time. I freely acknowledge that some of us have been frustrated and thought this ought to have been done last year, but there can be no doubt that our work product that will ultimately be signed into law will be a vast improvement for the American taxpayer, and it does enjoy the imprimatur of bipartisan effort and support. 
Finally, I will address an issue that has been of concern for literally tens of thousands of Nevadans who work in the hotel industry in our State. It is not a provision that is confined or limited to Nevada only because the practice in the hotel industry not only in my own State but across America is to provide for the convenience of the employee, by the employer, a meal at the business location. For more decades than I can remember, that benefit has been provided and it has been viewed as a nontaxable benefit. That is to say that the meal is provided and that there is no tax liability attached to that benefit that the employee must pay as a result of receiving that meal at the employer's expense, on the job, at the employer's place of business. 
A year ago, a decision of the Tax Court astounded most of us who are familiar with the practice and created a situation that would be monstrously unfair to literally tens of thousands of taxpayers in my own State where this issue was widely publicized, but would have the potential of affecting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of employees in every State in the Union. Not only would it be unfair to those employees who no longer would receive that benefit--and there would have been hundreds of thousands, as I say, across the country--but it would have created the anomaly that some employees in some occupational categories may continue to receive the benefit, 
their coworkers who worked alongside them in a different capacity would not have received that benefit, thereby creating an inherent morale problem within the workforce and a nightmare for employers to administer. That decision sent a shockwave throughout the hotel industry in my State, and employees were much concerned. 
The consequence of the Tax Court's decision, uncorrected, would have imposed several hundreds of dollars of additional tax liability each year. We are not talking about those who are part of a senior executive class, whose salaries are six figures or greater. By and large, we are talking about people who tend to be at the bottom end of the pay scale in the hotel industry--those who are porters and maids and in other categories. So hundreds of dollars, for them, had a major impact. 
I am pleased to say that as a result of the bipartisan support and the efforts of Nevada's delegation and the leadership on both the Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and several of our colleagues who served as conferees--I acknowledge that the senior Senator from Nebraska and the senior Senator from Louisiana who, in addition to the chairman and ranking member on our side, were extremely helpful--that consequence is not going to be visited upon the tens of thousands of employees in my own State and the hundreds of thousands elsewhere. 
In effect, a provision that is incorporated in this conference report will reverse the Tax Court's decision and will continue a practice that was established in terms of fairness and equity and will allow those employees to continue to receive those benefits without the additional tax consequences that the court decision would have imposed upon such employees. I want to publicly acknowledge all who were involved in helping to make that provision part of this provision. 
So, finally, Mr. President, this will not make this code a perfect code. I suspect that this will not be the end of our endeavors to provide additional ways in which we can provide fairness to the American taxpayers. But, hopefully, as a consequence of this legislation, the word will come from this Congress to the American people that we heard the complaints, we understand their legitimacy, we recognize that in a system such as our own, in which the compliance is essentially voluntary, we have an obligation to make sure that those who are trying to comply with the provisions of our complex Tax Code are treated fairly and, when problems are called to our attention, we will correct them. 
Again, I salute our colleagues who worked on this. I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee for their courtesies in hearing the concerns that I and other members of the committee brought. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid amendment, which would strike title 29 of the Defense Authorization bill, entitled `Juniper Butte Range Lands Withdrawal.' Title 29 would authorize development of the proposed Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) project of the Air Force. The ETI involves creation of a new Air Force training range covering parts of Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada to enhance training for aircrews of the 366th Wing based at Mountain Home AFB. The ETI would provide composite force training that includes multiple types and numbers of aircraft training together. The proposal would allow the Air Force to withdraw 12,000 acres of BLM land and associated airspace. Total DoD funding is estimated at $31.5 million. 
Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues several reasons why I feel the Enhanced Training in Idaho proposal lacks merit. 
1. The Air Force has not justified the need for a new training range. 
The Inspector General of the Department of Defense reviewed the Air Force's Idaho training range proposal and found that `the Air Force cost benefit analysis that supports the proposal was prematurely formulated because of the lack of an overall training plan for the 366th Wing.' 
The IG audit recommended that the Pentagon `withhold Air Force and Air National Guard funds related to establishing the Idaho training range.' 
In his comments to the IG, the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff acknowledged that the Idaho training range was not strictly necessary, and he stated that existing training resources enabled the 366th Wing to meet its training needs and to become combat ready. 
The IG concluded that `the Air Force has not established the training requirement for the 366th Wing composite force or proved why existing training ranges cannot continue to provide composite force training.' 
The IG further concludes that `the Utah, Nellis, and Fallon ranges are suitable for composite force training and the ranges have the required airspace and ground areas.' During the audit, officials of the 366th Wing stated that all training requirements were being met with the Saylor Creek Range and the Utah, Nellis, and Fallon ranges. 
2. The ETI proposal is nothing more than a BRAC insurance policy for Mountain Home AFB. 
The motivation for this proposal is clear: it lessens the likelihood of Mountain Home AFB being included in a future round of base closings. 
Senator Kempthorn was quoted in the Mountain Home News earlier this year as saying that the ETI range proposal `will be a great insurance policy for Mountain Home AFB.' 
3. Congress has not had the opportunity to review the proposal. 
Neither the Armed Services Committee nor the Energy and Natural Resources Committee have held any hearings on this proposal. 
Interested members of Congress and the public should have the opportunity to examine this proposal in the context of public hearings. 
In the 99th Congress, hearings were held in both the House and Senate on Legislation authorizing the withdrawal of public lands in the State of Nevada for training ranges in Fallon and Nellis. 
4. Environmental impacts associated with the proposal have not been adequately mitigated.. 
A substantial portion of the air space expansion proposed by the Air Force is in the state of Nevada. 
The Board of County Commissioners of Elko County, Nevada, has expressed its concern with the proposal regarding the impact of increased training flights over the Owyhee Canyonlands, which extend into Elko County in northern Nevada. 
Less than one-third of the acreage the BLM originally sought to protect is covered by the 5,000 foot minimum flight level contained in the agreement between BLM and the Air Force. 
The agreements 5,000 foot standard protects less than one-half of the wilderness study areas of that region and its archaeological and sacred Indian sites. 
It protects less than one-third of the candidate wild and scenic rivers. 
Finally, the agreement opens military overflights in the 
area surrounding Little Jacks Creek, which is the only remaining wild area in the Owyhees where people and wildlife, including bighorn sheep, can enjoy relative peace 
5. Impacts on the Shoshone-Paiute tribes have not been adequately addressed. 
The proposal omits any meaningful mitigation measures for the tribal members residing on the Duck Valley Reservation 
The language of the proposal pays only lip service to the importance of preserving access to and use of Indian sacred sites 
6. The compensation provisions for ranching operations is a taxpayer boondoggle. 
The proposal contains a lucrative compensation package for one rancher that currently has a federal grazing permit on the 12,000 acres targeted for the range 
It has been reported that the grazing permit involves 1,059 AUM's--an AUM is currently valued at $1.35--which would mean that the permittee is currently paying approximately $1,429 per year for his privilege to graze cattle on public land 
It has also been reported that the agreement between the Air Force and the permittee involves a buy out of all or a substantial portion of this grazing use at the rate of $250 per AUM, which equates to a total payment of $264,750; in addition, the Air Force has agreed to compensate the permittee for the replacement costs associated with constructing new range improvements on other grazing land 
The vast discrepancy between what this rancher has paid for his privilege to graze on public land and what he is being paid to relocate his grazing operation sets a dangerous precedent that should alarm the American taxpayer 
Mr. President, for the reasons stated above, I urge my colleagues to support the Reid amendment.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize a milestone in Nevada history. This weekend, Nevadans will celebrate the 50th anniversary of McCarran International Airport and on Monday the opening of the new `D' gates. 
Seventy-eight years ago, in 1920, pilot Randall Henderson landed his plane on a makeshift dirt runway marking Las Vegas' first flight. I am sure that Mr. Henderson had no idea that some 78 years later the McCarran International Airport would be one of the fastest growing airports in the country. 
That runway was later used by such famous people as Amelia Earhart, Clarence Prest, and Emery Rogers and came to be named Rockwell Field. 
Rockwell Field was sold in 1929. Fortunately, P.A. `Pop' Simon bought the land northeast of Las Vegas, the site of today's Nellis Air Force Base, and built the Las Vegas Airport. It was later named Western Air Express Field. In 1948, Clark County purchased an existing airfield on Las Vegas Boulevard South and established the Clark County Public Airport. 
That year, the airport was renamed McCarran Field, after Nevada's senior Senator, Senator Pat McCarran, who authored the Civil Aeronautics Act and played a major role in the development of aviation not only in Nevada but in the country. McCarran Airport was at that time already servicing 12 flights a day, by four airlines. Later, the growth of Las Vegas necessitated the move of the airport terminal from the Las Vegas Boulevard South location to Paradise Road, and the present McCarran Field Terminal was opened in 1963. At this time the airport was serving nearly 1.5 million passengers. Three short years later, the annual passenger volume exceeded the two-million mark for the first time in the airport's history. By 1978, tourism to the Las Vegas area had increased dramatically, and the McCarran 2000 master plan was established to respond to the burgeoning tourism industry. This plan brought the addition of more terminals, parking, runways, and passenger assistance facilities. After Phase I of the McCarran 2000 project was completed, the size of the airport quadrupled, adding 16 more gates. Later, a fourth runway was added along with major renovations to the runways and terminals, and in 1994, a 1,400-foot extension was added, making it one of the longest civilian runways in the United States. 
This Monday, McCarran will celebrate the opening of the new `D' gates, which will ultimately consist of 48 gates throughout four concourse wings. The completion of the `D' gates will enable the airport to serve a total of 55 million passengers per year, nearly double the current capacity. 
The growth of Las Vegas is a fact that has been recorded on many occasions. It has been dramatic. That growth could not have occurred if McCarran International had not kept pace and indeed anticipated the phenomenal tourism growth in southern Nevada. We salute McCarran on the 50th anniversary of its establishment. It has become an international gateway to the entertainment capital of the world. We are sure it was the farsighted leadership that has been provided in the past and its present expansion that will allow McCarran to continue to enjoy another 50 years of service to the community and to the millions of people who arrive by air each year making Las Vegas their destination.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am proud to take the floor today to commend and congratulate the University of Nevada-Las Vegas men's golf team on winning the team's first National Collegiate Athletic Association championship. This remarkable team of student-athletes acquitted themselves with great distinction this past week as they achieved this singular honor for themselves, for the community, and for the State of Nevada. 
This accomplishment is further embellished by the fact the team shot 4 rounds of golf 34 under par, which set a tournament record by 11 strokes. 
Chris Berry, one of the team members, shot a total of 272 for 16 under par, to finish second in the individual competition. What makes Chris' success even all the more noteworthy is that Chris had been involved in tournament play previous years where he had the misfortune of finishing at the other end and he, through determination and hard work, achieved this remarkable athletic achievement. 
Congratulations should also go to the rest of his teammates, Bill Lunde, Charley Hoffman, Jeremy Anderson and Scott Lander. Bill Lunde and Jeremy Anderson made the All American college golf team. This golf team has had the goof fortune of being under the direction of an extraordinarily gifted coach as well. Dwaine Knight has placed the university's golf program on the national map. They have, in recent years, been top competitors, but not until this year did they achieve the ultimate, and that is the collegiate championship. Coach Knight is ably assisted by Assistant Coach Casey Whalen. 
This year, under their coaching staff, the Rebels have won seven tournaments. The only other sports team in UNLV's history to attain national collegiate championship was in 1990, when the men's basketball program was so honored in the Final Four, in Denver, CO. 
UNLV completed its season No. 1 in the polls, and I have encouraged the President to invite this extraordinarily able student athletic team to come to the White House and be appropriately recognized. The President himself is a golfer of note and distinction, and I am sure these fine young men are going to be able to offer a few tips the President might take advantage of to improve his own golf game.

Mr. President, for those who are not familiar with the parliamentary intricacies of the Senate process, I think a reasonable question should be raised, and that is why are we debating this issue; namely, the placement of a temporary nuclear waste dump at the Nevada test site in Nevada, when, No. 1, the Speaker of the House has indicated that no such legislation will be processed in the House; and, No. 2, the President of the United States has said if any such legislation should reach his desk, he will veto it.

Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to respond to my colleague. Let me just say very briefly that statement appears in the form of a statement issued by the Congressman from the First Congressional District in Nevada in which he quotes the Speaker directly and explicitly, I must say, based upon a previous statement that the Speaker made with respect to the same House Member in 1996, when he indicated at that time no action would be taken on the temporary nuclear waste bill. In 1996, the Speaker was good to his commitment and did not do so. I presume that he would be in the same vein committed to honor the commitment he has made. 
I say to my friend from Alaska, I have no reason to challenge that. I have seen nothing from the Speaker to indicate that the Congressman's statement is inaccurate.

Mr. BRYAN. I reclaim the floor and I simply say, because I want to talk about a number of issues, I inform my friend and colleague that a House leadership aide today told one of the local publications here on Capitol Hill. 
. . . that the nuclear industry and other bill proponents should have seen this one coming. It was presumed among the leadership that a vote on an issue as contentious as nuclear waste storage could never take place in an election year. 
That is June 2, 1998. It comes from Congress Daily, a confirmation from a House leadership aide. I have no doubt it is true. 
Let me get to the point as our time is limited. There is a lot more in operation here than nuclear waste. We are talking, my friends, about an unholy alliance between two of the largest corporate entities in America--the nuclear power industry and the tobacco lobby. Here is how both of them win and the American taxpayer and the kids of America lose. The Democratic leader was absolutely correct when he said we should stay on the tobacco bill until we complete it, just as we have with other issues that are deemed priorities by the leadership in this Chamber. 
The way to do that is to stay on it, not to get sidetracked on another issue. From a procedural point of view, the majority leader, at any time, can file a motion to proceed to invoke cloture at any time. It seems to me more is in operation here than might meet the eye. No. 1, if we get off tobacco, and that will be the effect if cloture is granted--everybody in this Chamber knows that our time limit for this session is extremely limited, 13 weeks or less; there are 13 appropriations bills that have to be processed, and many other pieces of legislation--in effect, a vote to invoke cloture is a vote to kill tobacco. That is a vote that kills children in America. Three thousand each day take up smoking for the first time; 
1,000 of them will die prematurely as a result of smoking-related complications. 
A decade ago we thought we had made progress in reducing smoking of the underage. However, from 1990 to 1996 the statistics have been tragic and disastrous. The rates of teenage smoking have soared. In some categories of youngsters, African-American, they have more than doubled. In my view, it is absolutely important and imperative as a matter of public policy that we deal with the tobacco issue. 
Obviously, the nuclear waste industry has its own agenda but they find common ground with another industry in America, and that is the tobacco industry. The two of them come up with this strategy and both are winners and the American people are losers. 
Let's talk a little bit about the process for a moment. We are urged to move to consideration of a bill that is the House bill. That bill, by every standard, is much worse than a bad bill processed out of this Senate earlier in this Congress. The chairman of the Energy Committee has indicated that he has an amendment that will be offered shortly after--but everybody here understands what is happening. There is a so-called substitute that most of us have never seen--that at best is a work in progress--that we have no idea what it might be. There has been no conference, no conference. The Democratic members of the committee have not been involved or consulted in any way. This has been the nuclear utilities working out various provisions in the back room which serve their best interests, and which we have not yet seen in the light of day. 
My colleagues, you are asked to bring to the floor a bill that ultimately, if the substitute is offered, we don't have any indication as to what its contents may be. I agree with the majority leader when he said the responsible thing to do is to deal with each of these issues, tobacco and nuclear waste, separately and the way to do that is to vote no on the cloture motion and to stay on tobacco until we have completed it. Then if there is any desire to proceed, something that the majority leader has every right under the rule to do, he can proceed along that line. But there is no reason--none--to bring this issue to a head now. 
Now, let's just talk a little bit about the merits of this legislation and the need. For the last 18 years, the nuclear power industry in America has been crying there is an urgent need, catastrophe will fall upon us, that there is a crisis. 
Here is a statement made by our former colleague on the floor of the Senate, July 28, 1980--18 years ago--referring to a piece of legislation which was then referred to as away-from-reactor legislation, but essentially the same thing, a so-called temporary nuclear waste dump. Our former colleague said in discussing this:  
It is an urgent problem, Mr. President, for this Nation. It is urgent, first, because we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call away-from-reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983. 
Didn't happen, didn't happen. No nuclear utility in America has ever been closed down because of inadequate space. Some have been closed down because they are dangerous and they constitute a public health and safety risk, and others have shut down because simply in the evolving electrical markets of the day they are simply no longer economic. So that is the need argument. We are hearing that it is urgent; we need to deal with it. 
Let me talk about what the scientific community has said, the Nuclear Waste Review Board, not comprised of Nevada citizens who have strong views, as the chairman of the committee properly addresses. This is the scientific community. `The board sees no compelling technical or safety reasons to move spent fuel to a specialized safety facility.' 
None. Indeed, our colleagues have specifically incorporated into the law a provision that would be changed if this piece of legislation is processed that specifically precludes the establishment of a temporary nuclear waste dump until such time as a permanent dump is established. They knew then, as we ought to know now, that something that becomes temporary is de facto permanent in America. 
So the scientific community is not supportive. The President of the United States has indicated that he will veto this legislation. It is said the great joy of this piece of legislation is that all nuclear waste will be congregated in a single site. Not true, Mr. President. Not true. In effect, what we do is we will add one additional site. These designated sites on this chart indicate commercial reactors around the country. 
Those who are familiar with nuclear power understand that a nuclear reactor is powered by spent-fuel rods. Those spent-fuel rods, after a period of time, lose efficiency, so that they need to be removed from the reactor core and placed in storage. Those spent-fuel rods are what we are talking about here. That is the commercial nuclear waste. What is done, because they generate enormous amounts of heat, is they are placed in pools of water at the reactor site, so every commercial nuclear reactor in the country that has an active reactor will have someplace that by necessity they will have to store these spent nuclear rods for a period of 8, 9, 10 years. So this allusion that sometime we will have a single site is simply not the case at all. So long as there are commercial reactors in America, that is the process we must go through. 
Finally, a word about the court case and the responsibility of the Department of Energy. Mr. President, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted in 1982. It indicated there would be a series of contracts that would be entered into by each of the reactor sites and, indeed, that is what has occurred. Those contracts defined the responsibilities of the parties. The responsibility of the Department of Energy is, in the event that there is a delay in taking the nuclear waste from the reactor site--everyone must concede that is the case; there is no way possible that those dates can be met, and January 31, 1998, was the date--it expressly indicates that the remedy that is provided is that, to the extent the delay is ascertained, `the contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any additional cost incurred by the party not responsible for or contributing to the delay.' 
What that means is to the extent that a nuclear utility incurs additional expense for on-site storage that it would not otherwise have incurred had the Department of Energy been able to take the nuclear waste, the nuclear utility and its ratepayers are entitled to be compensated. I do not disagree with that. I have introduced legislation since coming to this body that would provide for that. The simple way that could be done is to reduce the amount of a contribution which the nuclear utility makes to the nuclear waste fund in the form of a mill tax levy on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power generated so that the ratepayers may be whole. That has been offered time and time again. The nuclear utilities reject that because they have a different agenda. We will talk more about that. Their agenda is to transfer the financial responsibility from the nuclear utilities to the American taxpayer, and that is one of the most outrageous features of this legislation.  
I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank my senior colleague, and I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, this debate is winding down, but I think we need to make very clear that there is no misimpression created that somehow the Senators from Nevada have injected the nuclear waste and the tobacco issue together. It is my strong preference, as a member of the Commerce Committee, having served on that committee, and having voted with the great majority 19-1 to report this bill out--I am referring to Senator McCain's legislation--and serving on the Finance Committee where it was reported out by a 12-6 vote--I was with the prevailing majority--my priority is to consider the tobacco legislation. 
It was not the Senators from Nevada who interjected nuclear waste in the midst of our discussion on tobacco. Now we have a way in this body of determining what our priorities are. If our priorities are addressed to finishing and completing a piece of legislation, neither hell nor high water can divert our attention and focus, and as the majority leader has said many times, and rightly so, we are going to stay on this issue until it is finished. 
What is different here? It is a matter of priorities, I suspect, an agenda that may not be spoken. The best and the most effective way to deal with the tobacco issue is to stay on the bill until we complete it, and that is the logical thing to do. To go off that bill, go on nuclear waste, back and forth, is not the logical way to do it. 
Mr. President, there is absolutely no urgency in the world to move to nuclear waste today. There is urgency to process this tobacco legislation. At the end of this day, when we return to our respective homes, another 3,000 young people in this country will have taken up smoking. And as we have said time and time again, 1,000 of them--1,000 of them--one-third will die prematurely as a result of smoking-related complications. 
That is the urgency. That is the priority that I attach. Let me say that there are some things that have been said about this legislation that I do not have time to respond to 
completely, but the Nevada legislature has very strongly expressed its opposition. It is suggested by the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee that you can understand why Nevadans would be opposed to this legislation. 
Let me suggest that opposition to this legislation has not come from Nevadans alone. When the American people are asked--the country as a whole--66 percent indicate they oppose temporary nuclear waste storage as proposed in this legislation. Only 17 percent support it; and another 17 percent do not know. This is a product of research done for the University of Maryland's 1997 National Omnibus Survey. 
I have very little time, Mr. President, but I want to talk about what I call the `dirty little secret' that is involved here. What the nuclear utility industry wants more than anything else is for the American public--the taxpayers in America--to lift this financial responsibility. 
Our friends in opposition who urge cloture frequently invoke the sanctity of this contract. This contract, as well as the legislation before us, requires those utilities to make a contribution to the nuclear waste trust fund of $1 million. That is a tenth of a penny for each kilowatt hour of nuclear power generated by these reactors. Here are the numbers. At no time did it contemplate, in addition to the expense incurred in terms of a permanent repository, that there would be an interim that would be added to this cost. 
Here are the total costs to this program: $53.9 billion that is kind of broken down in terms of the Nevada transportation crosscountry, the so-called centralized interim storage facility that is being talked about here, 
all of the other expenditures. 
So, $53.9 billion is what nuclear waste storage is going to cost us in America when this program ultimately winds down. 
Here is the agenda, here is the agenda: total program costs, $53.9 billion; total revenue derived from the utilities, and that is at the current rate of 1 mill for each kilowatt-hour, is $28.1 billion. 
Guess who gets stuck with that number? Guess who gets stuck with that number? All of you, all of you. Every taxpayer in America, $25.8 billion. That is at the current rate. If that gives you a little bit of elevated blood pressure, under H.R. 1270, the contribution of 1 mill would be roughly reduced by a third. So it would be, like, three-tenths of 1 mill, which would mean this number--rather than going to $25.8 billion, billions of additional dollars will have been added. 
That is what the agenda is on the part of the utilities. Their contract, the same contract that has been invoked with such sanctity, as well as the legislation, requires the nuclear utility industry to cover the costs of the high-level waste disposal program in America. They would like to shift that burden to you. 
Now, we haven't talked about one other issue, and that is, finally, the transportation issue. It is absolutely crazy, and the Congress recognized this, to `site' an interim storage, whatever merit an interim storage might have. Assume for the sake of argument there was some conceivable merit to it, although I must say I find none and there is no compelling reason and none of the scientists tells us it ought to be done. Assume for the sake of argument, no one agrees we should have a site for interim storage until the permanent site is determined. 
This chart depicts the transportation routes. Nevada is frequently the focus because we wind up at the end. But there are over 50 million Americans who will be affected within 1 mile or less of the site of the various transportation routes. This chart shows rail routes and highway routes. Every American is placed at risk. That makes no sense, either. That is why the current law, the law that would be changed by H.R. 1270--no temporary facility until we make a judgment with respect to the permanent. 
I conclude as I began. There is a lot more to this than meets the eye. The President of the United States has indicated he is going to veto this legislation and he has indicated the reasons for that. Bad policy and bad science conclude that this ought not to be passed. The Speaker of the House, who wears a different political jersey than the Senators of Nevada, indicates that this legislation is not going to be enacted or acted upon by the House this year. He made a similar statement in 1996 and it was not processed. 
So, why are we doing this? Why are we going off of the tobacco bill? Could it be that there are some in this Chamber who really don't want to see tobacco legislation enacted? There is no conceivable reason that we have to have the vote on nuclear waste today. The leadership has every right at any time to file a motion to invoke cloture under our rules to proceed to the bill, and it is simply a matter of time elapsing for that to mature. That could be done next week, the week thereafter, or in anticipation of the conclusion of the tobacco debate. 
I respectfully submit, Mr. President, that the timing of this issue is highly suspect. To those of us who are committed to the tobacco legislation, that is a priority in America. Can there be any greater priority than the young people in America, at a time when the data reflects that the rate of increase of youngsters under the age of 18 has increased dramatically? We need comprehensive tobacco legislation. A vote invoking cloture jeopardizes that bill, may kill the tobacco legislation. Oppose the cloture vote, we stay on tobacco. We do what the American people have a right to expect us to do, and that is to act on behalf of the young people of America. 
I reserve any remainder of time I may have.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida has cut to the core of this issue. From the perspective of those who want this legislation to proceed, the question of adopting the House bill without amendment obviously moves that process forward. We are now told that, no, that is not the strategy, that we want to offer a so-called Bingaman amendment; and then we hear that there is a so-called perfecting amendment, which nobody has seen. Out our way, that is called keeping some cards up your sleeve. We don't have any idea what we are going to be asked to vote on. I think our colleague makes a good point. I urge rejection of the motion to invoke cloture.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed the nomination of Patrick A. Mulloy for Assistant Secretary of Commerce for market access and compliance. I strongly support his nomination and believe the country will be well served by his appointment. 
When I first came to the Senate, I was given a seat on the Senate Banking Committee where Pat was a senior staff member. Pat's knowledge of the rules and procedures of the Senate was invaluable to me. Many a Senator has drawn upon Pat's expertise and institutional memory, and he is widely respected on both sides of the aisle. 
Pat is recognized as one of the Senate's leading experts in international trade and finance matters. He has spent countless hours working on international trade agreements that are helping open up foreign markets to the U.S. financial services industry. Few people have fought as hard for our interests as has Pat. The Senate will sorely miss him. 
The Commerce Department will benefit from Pat's enthusiasm, intelligence and personal warmth. The country is fortunate to have some with Pat's commitment to public service. I wish him the best of luck in his new endeavor and look forward to continuing to work with him on important issues facing the country.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair for his courtesy, as well as his parliamentary ruling. 
Mr. President, as we debate this historic tobacco legislation today, 3,000 children across the country will try smoking for the first time. Of those 3,000 children, one-third, or 1,000, will become addicted is the only way to describe it, addicted to nicotine and will face a future of diminished health. The health consequences of the use of tobacco products is our country's most preventable public health problem, and our goal in this legislation is to stop underage smoking. 
Our debate on this tobacco legislation is, indeed, a historic event. Less than a year ago, with the announcement of the June 1997 settlement reached between the States' attorneys general and the tobacco industry, few would have foreseen that we would have comprehensive legislation to address the national problem of underage use of tobacco products on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I give particular commendation to the Nation's attorneys general who deserve much credit for putting this issue in the forefront of public debate. 
A year ago, the conventional wisdom may very well have been that the Senate would be incapable of debating comprehensive tobacco legislation. It was then said the tobacco industry was too strong, its grip upon the Congress too powerful. Mr. President, a different force arose. 
The sustained efforts of the public health community, and in particular the former Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. C. Everett Koop, and the former FDA Commissioner, Dr. David Kessler, these two, as well as other public health advocates, have kept the focus on a common goal: a major reduction and hopefully the eventual elimination of underage smoking. 
This legislation may not be perfect, but it does represent an extraordinary accomplishment. The initial Commerce Committee bill offered by Senator McCain was a crucial step in ensuring that the tobacco industry would not be allowed to stop the effort to protect our Nation's children. After the Commerce Committee reported out its bill--and I am proud to say as a member of that committee I joined with a great majority of my colleagues in voting to report that bill out of committee--the tobacco industry walked away from the legislative process and then began an orchestration by the industry to end our efforts to protect our children. 
The tobacco industry badly miscalculated again. Instead, our resolve to protect our children's future has been strengthened. This effort is of vital importance for the children of our Nation and for their future health. 
In the 11 months since the proposed 1997 settlement, 990,000 underage children have become smokers. One-third, or approximately 330,000, of those children will eventually die prematurely because of tobacco-related illnesses. This is a tragic statistic. This undermining of our children's future health must end. 
If a child begins smoking before he or she reaches the age of their 18th birthday, there is an 80 percent likelihood that child will continue to smoke into adulthood. For these young children, the decision to try smoking has ramifications far beyond their understanding at such a tender age. These young people view themselves as I suppose all generations of young people have--as being indestructible. They do not realize, nor fully comprehend, the significance of their decision. That is a condemnation to a possible future of lifetime addiction to 
tobacco and a possible lifetime threatening health condition. 
I keep using that word `addiction' because that is what we are talking about, Mr. President, addiction. How urgent our efforts are to reinforce these efforts have been highlighted by the recent report from the Centers for Disease Control, a report which indicates that the increase of tobacco usage by underage youth has increased by alarming proportions. 
Just 7 years ago, 27.5 percent of all high school students in America smoked. In 1997, that number had risen to 36.4 percent. At the same time, the number of adult smoking was declining. Young African-Americans historically have been able to resist the tobacco industry's advertising reach and had relatively low levels of underage tobacco use. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Smoking by African-American students has almost doubled in the past 7 years, the fastest growth rate of any youth group over the past 6 years. White youth smoking has increased by 28 percent, and Hispanics have increased by 34 percent over the same time period. 
Overall, 5.5 million of our Nation's 15 million high-school-age children are smokers. This report's findings are most distressing. Rather than gaining, we are losing ground in our effort to protect our children's health. 
The decision to smoke or not to smoke is, we are told, an adult choice, and I share that perspective. But we have learned that the tobacco industry has systematically focused its marketing strategies on underage smokers and then lied about it. They lied to the American people. They lied to the Congress. 
To get middle-school-age children--these are youngsters who are not yet in high school--to try smoking and then to get them hooked on nicotine is the key to the tobacco industry's future markets and profits. To hook these children at this early age means these young people will have been smoking for 3 to 5 years before they have reached the legal age to make that decision, the age of majority or adulthood at 18. What the tobacco industry has done is tantamount to a crime. 
Let me be clear I strongly believe underage children also bear responsibility when they attempt to use, purchase or possess tobacco products, and they need to be held accountable for their illegal activity. I am pleased that at my request this legislation includes provisions to require States to have penalties so that underage youth who do try to purchase a tobacco product will know it is illegal and that it carries consequences. These penalties can include community service, fines and suspension of driver's license privileges. But holding young people responsible for illegal smoking or possessing tobacco products in no way excuses the tobacco industry for its shameless efforts to encourage underage smoking. 
Our underage children have been the premeditated focus of the tobacco industry's effort to ensure there is a future, and I use their terminology, `replacement market' for their products. This industry has for years strategized as to the methodology to entice our youngest children to identify tobacco product brands with the sole purpose of getting them to try smoking as early as possible. This industry knew the earlier a child tries smoking, the greater the likelihood will be that child will continue to smoke and become addicted to nicotine. Once addicted to nicotine, that child will very likely continue smoking into adulthood, and then the industry will have accomplished its goal: the creation of a future replacement market for its products. 
In the tobacco industry documents recently made public, this is manifestly clear. An R.J. Reynolds document states:  
This young adult market, the 14 to 24 group. . . represent[s] tomorrow's cigarette business. As this 14 to 24 age group matures, they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume--for at least the next 25 years. 
Yesterday, Mr. President, I was privileged to attend the White House Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. I was impressed with the more than 1,400 youngsters who gathered, representing America's youth, who made a determination not to be fooled by the tobacco industry. These young people have already made a choice, and that choice is to say `no' to the tobacco industry's attempt to take their future health away from them. 
The tobacco industry has tried to manipulate the legislative process by intimidation. But the industry's saber rattling about its ability to win trials has been seriously undermined by its own actions. 
The tobacco industry, among other criticisms of this bill, has consistently maintained that any legislation not limited to the $386.5 billion originally negotiated amount by the attorneys general and the tobacco industry in their June 1997 settlement would result in the bankruptcy of the industry. 
The legislation we debate today is estimated to cost over $516 billion over 25 years, and the tobacco industry is asserting that such an amount would result in their bankruptcy. 
However, I think it is noteworthy to point out that during the course of the congressional deliberations on the attorneys general-industry settlement, the tobacco industry itself has settled that it has voluntarily entered into an agreement with the State of Mississippi for $3.4 billion, the State of Florida for $11.3 billion, the State of Texas for $15.3 billion, and, most recently, the State of Minnesota for $6.6 billion. 
Now, the tobacco industry's willingness to pay these multibillion-dollar judgments in just 4 of the 41 States makes two very important points. First, the industry's contention with respect to bankruptcy has been proven to be specious. These four settlements extrapolated to the remaining State lawsuits would cost the industry approximately $500 billion, nearly the same amount as the cost of the McCain legislation. 
A further note. This industry was prepared, as a consequence of the June 1997 settlement that it voluntarily entered into, to decrease youth smoking by approximately 40 percent. The industry did not seem too concerned in June of 1997 that a loss of 40 percent of their market would bring about bankruptcy. And it does seem logical to believe that the industry would not have voluntarily negotiated a settlement if they believed that settlement would put them out of business. 
A second point, if I may, Mr. President. The magnitude of these settlements only served to verify the industry's determination not to allow any lawsuit to go to a jury because they are fearful of the outcome--just what a jury might do once a jury fully understands the egregious misconduct of this industry and the impact it has had upon our Nation's children. 
So the tobacco industry has also pulled out another old scare tactic, that this legislation creates a monster, convoluted, massive new bureaucracy. Quite to the contrary, this legislation does not. All administrative efforts need to assure that the proper implementation of this historic legislation will be done by currently existing agencies. 
This legislation does provide for a very strong Food and Drug Administration role in the efforts to stop underage tobacco use and to assure the public of our Nation that its safety and the safety of our young people will be its paramount concern. 
Now, I have consistently supported the FDA's efforts to reduce underage smoking. I am pleased that this bill will reinforce and, indeed, strengthen the ability of the FDA to continue to protect the public health of our citizens. The legitimate concerns raised by convenience store retailers who had feared they could, as a retail group or class, be prevented from selling tobacco products under the proposed FDA regulations have been addressed. These retailers have now expressed their support for the proposed State licensing of business entities selling tobacco products as a means of further controlling access of these products to underage children. Under the revised FDA regulation section, the FDA will be able to revoke a retailer's license, on an individual basis, to control those retailers who do not abide by sale restrictions. This will protect those responsible retailers who are committed to preventing underage access to tobacco products, and to punish those who irresponsibly do not do all they can to prevent young people from illegally purchasing tobacco products. 
Mr. President, equally ridiculous to the bureaucracy `scare' 
is the assertion that a massive black market will emerge. On the floor, we have heard over and over again the black-market warnings of Jim Pasco, the executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police. What tobacco supporters fail to tell us is that this same gentleman is on the payroll of Philip Morris, this country's largest tobacco company. 
So I conclude, Mr. President, by observing that the arguments made by the opponents of this legislation are pure smokescreens. The issue is really simple: Will Congress have the courage to vote on the side of America's youngsters and to protect our youngsters from the possible lifetime health-crippling afflictions that are attributed to the use of tobacco that cause the premature death of hundreds of thousands of people each year or will it support the tobacco industry? 
I hope my colleagues will take the courageous and historic step to vote for this legislation and to protect the young people in America. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of the Pau-Wa-Lu Middle School in Gardnerville, Nevada. Each year for the last four years, Pau-Wa-Lu Middle School has been involved in a major service project within its community. 
In 1995/96, the school sponsored a cleanup project during which 250 students and adults cleared years of accumulated trash from green belts within their community. 
In 1997, when a major flood devastated the homes and businesses of many of Northern Nevada's citizens, over 600 students and adults donated more than 4,000 man hours to helping flood victims recover their lives and property. 
And in 1998, over 300 students and adults from Pau-Wa-Lu and Carson Valley Middle Schools have planted trees in Autumn Hills, an area that has been devastated by forest fire. 
I am pleased to recognize Pau-Wa-Lu Middle School for its commitment to community and instilling this same spirit in its students.

As I understand, we have actual knowledge, we can have simple or ordinary negligence, we can have gross negligence, and then we can have a standard of reckless conduct which is an utter disregard of the facts. Is the Senator saying that the legislation that we are processing today does not clarify in the findings of this committee that we want to reaffirm that reckless misconduct ought to be a cause of action for those who are defrauded by investors?

Mr. BRYAN. So if I understand the Senator's position, if S. 1260 is passed, we preempt State class actions so that small investors would not have the advantage of a longer statute of limitations that a number of States--I believe 33 out of the 50--provide to investors suing at the State level class actions. 
We would deprive the small investor of his or her opportunity to go against the accomplices, the lawyers, the accountants, and others who conspired with the primary perpetrator of fraud. That protection is taken away. And we also eliminate the ability to move and to obtain a joint and several liability judgment against those offenders. They are all things which I understand currently exist to the benefit of small investors as class actions at the State level in most States, if I am not mistaken.

Mr. BRYAN. Will the Senator yield? I don't want to interrupt his presentation. I am always happy to wait, but we are talking of the reckless standard. 
If I might inquire of the Senator, the SEC, as I understand it, has sent over a definition of `reckless.' If that could be included in the findings of fact as opposed to the report language, I think it would strengthen what we all seek to do, and that is to retain the reckless standard, which I know is the objective of the Senator from Connecticut. 
As the Senator knows far better than I, report language is fairly thin gruel compared to the findings of fact which are included or other issues which the sponsors of the legislation--I wonder if the Senator would consider including that definition.

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, this legislation that we are debating today, as I have said on previous occasions, is somewhat arcane and esoteric. It is not the sort of thing where, for people who are at home watching this debate, it causes them to move to the edge of their chairs and to hang on every word. 
It is, however, terribly important for the tens of millions of small investors who, in recent years, have invested in the future of America, and for their confidence in the market system that we have created, because they are the small investors, they are the ones who will be impacted by this legislation. The large investors, the large institutions, will still have options that heretofore the small investors have had but the small investors will be deprived of as a result of this legislation. So it is the view of the Senator from Nevada that this legislation plunges a dagger into the heart of every small investor in America. 
What we are talking about is not whether a case can be brought in State court or Federal court. We are talking about a system, which currently exists, that allows a private small investor to be part of a class action, and other small investors who have been defrauded as a result of the misconduct of others, to come together and file an action in State court and to avail themselves of statutes of limitations that are longer than are available to those of us who file in Federal court to provide, for joint and several liability, the ability to recover from accomplices--particularly important if the primary offender has bankrupted himself or herself or itself or has taken leave--and to avail himself or herself of triple damages under RICO. 
So this has a very practical impact. Actions that would be available to small investors at the State court level will no longer--no longer--be available to those small investors, as a practical matter. So we continue a process which alarmed my good friend, the distinguished ranking member of this committee, the distinguished Senator from Maryland, that began with the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and, in our view, simply goes too far. 
Those of us who express strong reservations about this bill find no comfort with those who are filing strike suits, those who are involved in litigiousness for the sake of litigiousness. I believe it would be possible to craft a narrow provision that addresses the ostensible concerns that have been raised and yet not deprive small investors in this country of their rights under the law. 
The system for private enforcement of remedies has existed now for more than six decades. It is a dual system involving the State courts and the Federal courts. It has worked exceptionally well. The SEC has repeatedly testified as to the importance of private rights of actions as being absolutely essential to augment their own enforcement efforts. Indeed, they have said they have not the ability nor the resources to deal with the vast panoply of investor fraud, and they view the private cause of action as essential. 
Indeed, States were the first to enact these protections against fraud in the early 1900s, and when, in the mid-1930s, the statutes that essentially provided the framework for Federal securities regulation were put in place, it was expressly intended to supplement, not to supersede, to complement, not to wipe out, and the language of this legislation today specifically preempts the State cause of action for class actions. These State remedies are vitally important, and States have responded in a number of different ways by providing protections. I am going to talk about three primarily. 
The statute of limitations. Why is that important? Those who perpetrate fraud on small investors don't do so openly and nakedly; they try to conceal it to protect that activity. So the unfortunate decision of the court in the Lampf decision, which limits at the Federal level the right of an investor who has been defrauded 1 year from the point of discovery of the fraud, 3 years even though the investor never becomes aware of that fraud, is viewed by the Securities Commission as unreasonable because it takes them, with all of their resources, a minimum of 3 1/2 years. 
The statute of limitation is not just an arcane debate about how long one should have, it is the ability of a small investor who has been defrauded without his knowledge and, never 
having learned of it within the 3-year period of time, is now precluded. Thirty-three States in this country, including my own in Nevada, provide for a longer statute of limitation. Some provide 2 years from the time of discovery of fraud, or 5 or 6 or even 10 years, and some provide no bar at all. 
In the vast majority of States in America, small investors filing class actions who do not discover the fraud until after 3 years are currently, under existing law, protected in at least 33 States. This legislation cuts off that right, and even though we all agree or, as the lawyers say, stipulate to the merit of the claim, it is barred--barred--by the 3 years even though the small investor never became aware of the fraud. That is what we are talking about. 
Forty-nine of the 50 States provide liability for the accomplices--those who conspired with the primary perpetrator of the fraud, whether they be lawyers, whether they be accountants, whether they be other investment advisers--to provide a cause of action--49 out of 50. Unfortunately, at the Federal level, there is no remedy for plaintiffs against aiders and abetters. So that means that if the primary offender, the perpetrator, becomes bankrupt, leaves the country, or is otherwise unable to respond in damages, historically at the State court level, the class-action plaintiffs could recover against those who conspired and aided in that fraud. 
The action that we take with S. 1260 deprives small investors filing class actions from this recovery. So now, if we pass this legislation, they are precluded from moving against those who conspired and actively participated in the fraud. 
Moreover, States, as a matter of providing protection to their own citizens, have provided in a number of jurisdictions for joint and several liability. That means if five or six are guilty of the fraud and only one has the ability to respond in damages, States have made the determination that as between the innocent investor, utterly blameless, that the innocent investor ought to be satisfied against the perpetrator of that fraud, even though there may have been several involved. That is wiped out. 
We have, in effect, a piece of legislation before us that dramatically limits the right of a small investor to pursue a class action in State court and to avail himself or herself of a whole host of remedies which States have provided on their own. 
I must say, the irony of this course of action by a Republican Congress that has proclaimed its devotion to State rights and has raged against preemption by a Congress at the Federal level of essentially State rights does not go unnoticed by this Senator. 
Why are class actions important? Again, it is pretty esoteric. Think for a moment. Tens of millions of small investors who may have been victimized by a fraud don't have the ability to hire a lawyer on their own to fight against entrenched special interests who have the ability to provide legal defenses and delays and delays. That is practically no remedy at all. It is only by binding together with other investors, small investors who are similarly situated, as the law says, that those costs can be spread and a recovery can be possible. 
When we say, as proponents of this legislation, `Well, the small investor can still file in State court,' that is true, but it is a hollow and transparent remedy because, as a practical matter, small investors simply do not have the ability to pay for the lawyer's fees and the costs that are involved in processing these kind of cases. 
That was the situation that 23,000 senior citizens who joined in a class action against Charlie Keating and Lincoln Savings and Loan found themselves in a few years ago. It was a class action, and they were ultimately able to recover 65 cents on the dollar of their losses. 
Had those plaintiffs been involved today with a shorter cause of action at the Federal level, with the cause of action unavailable at the State level for class actions, those plaintiffs would have not been able to recover that kind of money. The examples of these kinds of groups are not just small individuals, but they include school districts, municipalities, special improvement districts, pension funds at the State and municipal level. 
All of these are going to be affected by this legislation. As a practical matter, a class action provides the only realistic hope of recovery. 
As I pointed out, the SEC, with all its resources, says it takes them up to 3 years to compile the data to bring these securities fraud suits. So in effect, what we are doing now is we are providing for two classes of investors: Those who have been defrauded who are people of means, of wealth, so they can hire their own lawyers, they can still file at the State court level and take advantage of the longer statute of limitations, can take advantage of the provisions that provide liability against accomplices, can take advantage against the joint and several liability protections available at the State level. But if you are a small investor--and that is what most of those who are defrauded are, small investors--that remedy is no longer available to you. 
So the question arises: Why are we doing this? What is the problem? Well, frankly, to the great credit of our regulatory framework, we have the safest and the most efficient securities markets in the world. 
In 1990, there were 158 IPOs, totaling $4.6 billion. In 1997, 7 years later, there were 619 IPOs, totaling $39 billion. The stock market has recently set record highs. The Dow is over 9,000. And individuals confident in these markets are pouring in $40 billion a month in mutual funds. In 1980, 1 in every 18 households in America invested in the stock market. Less than 20 years later, it is more than one in three. That is a great tribute to the security and safety of this market. 
Why are we reducing the investor protections at a time when the stock market is surging and consumer confidence is growing? 
Investor confidence is crucial, and it is threatened by increasing fraud. I believe it was President Kennedy who made the observation, that, `A rising tide'--referring to the economy--`raises all boats.' And I think that is true. But it is equally true it also hides the shoals. 
Newsweek, in its October 6, 1997, edition: `Scam Scuttling: The Bull Market is Drawing Con Artists. SEC Chairman Levitt summarized, `In a market like this, parasites crowd in to feast on the bull's success.' 
Business Week, December 15: `Ripoff! Secret World of Chop Stocks--And How Small Investors--[and that is what we are talking about] Are Getting Fleeced.' The article focuses on small-cap equities manipulated to enrich promotors and defraud thousands of small investors--a $10 billion-a-year business that regulators and law enforcement have barely dented. 
The New York Times of November 26 of last year: `Lessons of Boesky and Milken Go Unheeded in Fraud Case.' In one case, 1,600 investors were swindled out of $95 million. 
Yet Federal and State enforcement resources are shrinking as these fraudulent schemes are perpetrated upon the innocent small investors. 
Now is not the time, I would respectfully argue, to in effect rip from the investor his or her opportunity to recover that which has been lost as a result of being victimized by fraud. Our securities markets run on trust, Madam President--on trust--not money. There will be much less trust, I fear, if this legislation occurs. 
Look what has happened in countries around the world: `Albania tries to regain control [of the Ponzi scheme].' That can't happen in America with the system that we have created. 
`Shanghai Stock Market Cited for Scandal.' `10,000 Stampede as Russian Stock [Market] Collapses.' `Scandal Besets Chinese Markets.' 
My point being that we have devised a system to protect investors. And I fear, by reason of overly broad legislation, we are depriving small investors of the very opportunity to recover that which has provided the confidence in the market that has encouraged such a massive investment by small investors. 
Why? We are led to believe there is a massive influx of cases that must be preempted because everybody is going to the State court to bypass the provisions of the 1995 law. 
Price Waterhouse, in January of 1998, made a report, an evaluation. Forty-four State cases--44--were filed in all of 1997, a one-third decrease since 1996--I want to emphasize that, a decrease--when 66 were filed, and less than in the 3 years before the 1995 legislation. A followup Price Waterhouse study, in February, tells us 39 cases were filed. 
My point being, whether it is 39 or 44, I would not argue that with my colleagues, but that is, out of 15 million cases, civil cases--not criminal, not traffic, not domestic relations--we are talking about 44 cases or 39 cases out of 15 million filed. That is a very, very small number. And although there are some problems, as has been pointed out by the proponents, none of the problems justifies the sweeping emasculation of investor protections that this legislation provides for. 
Now, what are the problems specifically in the act itself? 
If one believes that uniform standards are an essential public policy in the country--and, I must say, I have not been persuaded--then I think we would agree that a uniform standard that provides strong investor protections ought to be a part of that uniform standard. 
Unfortunately, what we have done, in each and every case, is opted for the lowest common denominator of protection. If the statute of limitations is longer at the State level, we have preempted it and limited the statute of limitations. If the State provides for liability against those who are accomplices, we take that cause of action away from the small investor. If the State allows for joint and several recovery against each and every one of those involved in the fraud, we take that away from the small investor. 
So it is my view that this is part of an ongoing process in which we have, in my judgment, left the small investor high and dry in many cases if this legislation passes. 
I must say that when you look at the trend line following the 1995 legislative enactments, you can see that pattern unfold. The Lampf decision, which shocked the SEC and others, limited the statute of limitations to 1 year from the time of discovery of the fraud to 3 years. The SEC recognized that that is an unreasonable period of time. And those who argued several years ago for comprehensive reforms said, `Look, we'll address the statute of limitations at that point.' We tried, Madam President, in 1995 to address the statute of limitations, but we were rebuffed. Now this legislation takes the longer statute of limitations, available in 33 out of 50 States, away from those small investors. 
The Supreme Court, in the Central Bank case, held that there is no ability to hold accomplices liable. We tried to provide for aider and abetter coverage. The SEC strongly supports that. We were told that when we redid the Federal securities laws that that would be included. My colleague from Maryland and I tried, and we were rebuffed in that effort. 
Joint and several liability, eliminated in the 1995 act. Civil RICO, eliminated. Discovery provisions, limited. In 1996, we made a determination to divide some of the regulatory responsibility between State and Federal authorities. 
In 1998, we are here with S. 1260, which I think is the coup de grace in terms of small investor protection. 
So I must say that I am greatly disturbed by this threat. I believe that small investors ultimately will pay the price. 
It is often said that those of us who oppose this legislation must be working for those nefarious trial lawyers. Let's take a look at the groups who support the position that the senior Senator from Maryland and I take. The American Association of Retired Persons. When I attend one of their meetings, I haven't seen a single retired lawyer in attendance. The AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State County and Municipal Workers, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, and many, many others, as you can see, particularly those involved with the State retirement associations, including the Public Employees Retirement System, the League of Cities, the National Association of Counties and Municipal Treasuries. 
Let me read a paragraph from a letter that the able Senator from Maryland introduced, coming from the Government Finance Officers Association, the Municipal Treasurers'Association, National Association of Counties, National Association of County Treasurers, National Association of State Retirement Administrators, National Conference on Public Employee Retirement System, National League of Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors. They raise many of the same objections that I have outlined today, as has my colleague from Maryland. 
Here is their comment:  
The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was opposed by state and local governments because the legislation did not strike an appropriate balance, and this legislation extends that mistake to state courts. As both users of debt and investors of public funds, state and local governments seek to not only reduce frivolous lawsuits but to protect state and local government investors who are defrauded in securities transactions. . . . 
The above organizations believe that States must be able to protect State and local government funds. 
We are talking about taxpayer dollars. We are not talking about litigious plaintiffs. We are talking about pension funds, municipal State funds in which those entities have been defrauded and now will be provided much less protection to recover tax dollars--dollars belonging to each and every citizen who is a part of that group. 
Let me address one final point here as we conclude this discussion. One of the concerns that has been expressed is that there is no adequate assurance that liability will continue to exist against those who are reckless in their conduct. Now, that is a standard more egregious than simple negligence, more egregious than gross negligence. We are talking about conduct that is reckless in nature. 
Prior to 1995, when the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act was enacted, 11 of 13 circuits in this country had addressed the issue and had concluded that there was a cause of action for those who are guilty of reckless misconduct. The 1995 legislation, because it talked about a specific pleading standard, has created some confusion. Following the 1995 enactment, several district courts have concluded that no longer is there liability for reckless misconduct. 
Now, the proponents of this legislation say that they do not intend that as a consequence. And I accept their representation. However, we have tried to get into this bill a provision crafted by the SEC defining `reckless' to make it absolutely sure that `reckless' is protected. Their response? If the courts strike down `reckless' we will remedy it. 
I never impugn anyone's good faith, but I am a product of the experience that I have had in this legislation. We were told back in the 1990s that we would address the statute of limitation problem when we looked at comprehensive legislation to correct that. It did not occur. We were told after the Central Bank case that we will address the problem in which aiders and accomplices are no longer liable under the law. We were rejected in that effort. So I must say I find my comfort level not very high if the courts intend that. It seems to me if we are in earnest in wanting to protect that `reckless' standard, it is terribly important we use a definition which the SEC has provided. Let's make it part of this legislation. 
I am not unmindful of the fact that this bill is a train that is leaving the station. It will pass and it will be signed into law. But it would be a tragic mistake not to make absolutely sure that `reckless' is included. I believe a fair reading of the 1995 legislation should not give rise to an inference that `reckless' has somehow been changed. I don't believe that was the intent. The authors of this legislation say it is not true, but even when we try to get it moved into the findings of the legislation, we get resistance, so I have concern. 
Let me conclude by saying this is a piece of legislation which is a solution in search of a problem, overly broad and dangerous to millions of small investors in America. 
I yield the floor and reserve whatever time remains.

Is the Senator indicating that an investor who files in a State court in a timely fashion after having consulted with legal counsel that said, yes, this is a timely action--and we shall assume for the sake of the discussion meritorious--can have his action, in effect, dismissed by having it removed to the Federal court and the shorter statute of limitations of 1 to 3 years as is required under Federal law?

Mr. BRYAN. So the perpetrator of the fraud, if I understand what the Senator from Maryland is saying, has the ability to wipe out the small investor by removing the cause of action to the Federal court, even though that case was filed timely under State law and even though the small investor says, Look, I want to have this action continued at the State level. So the Senator is saying, if I understand the Senator from Maryland correctly, that the power to wipe out this cause of action, to wipe out any possibility for relief, are now providing that to the perpetrator of the fraud?

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine for her, I think, most illuminating statement in terms of the problem that we face with the shorter statute of limitations. She is absolutely correct. Her State--and my own--apparently, if I understood the distinguished Senator, has a 1- and 5-year statute; 5 years is the outside. That is what we have in Nevada as well. 
The testimony beyond refutation is that a 3-year statute is simply too short. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has all of the resources available to the Federal Government, much more so than any individual investor, tells us that on average it takes more than 3 years to do the investigation, to bring the cause of action. Certainly the small investor is seriously disadvantaged here, so I thank her for her comment and her leadership. 
Let me just make a couple of comments. I know we have talked about this in the context of the debate on the bill, but the unfairness of this legislation to the small consumer can best be described: Heads the perpetrator of the fraud wins; tails the small investor loses. This is a `no win' proposition for the small investor. 
The thrust of this legislation is to say that the traditional class action lawsuit should no longer be available at the State court level. And, by `traditional class actions' we mean individual plaintiffs who are bound together by a common lawyer who files on behalf of a lot of people who have been victimized by the identical fraud. That is really what a class action traditionally has been. 
Our friends on the other side say there have been some abuses. I acknowledge that there may have been some abuses there. I would be willing to work with them in dealing with the abuses. But here is the ingenious and unfair part of this. The proponents say, `The individual has a right to file an action at the State court level, would have all the rights currently available under State law--the longer statute of limitations, the accomplice liability, the joint and several, the RICO provisions.' OK, that sounds somewhat fair, although as we have pointed out, most small investors simply don't have the resources to bring such a case. But let's suppose that your teachers' pension fund, or what we have in Nevada, the public employee retirement system--suppose they bring an action at the State level: One plaintiff, one lawyer, and, lo and behold, they have discovered 4 years after the fact of fraud that the public employee retirement system fund has been ripped off by a monstrous fraud. They file suit in State court. 
Surely you would think it would be possible for that one plaintiff to pursue a remedy under State law. But here is how the bill is crafted. Without the permission or consent of that public employee retirement system, if there are 49 other plaintiffs who file against the perpetrator of the fraud, then involuntarily, without the permission of the public employee retirement system, they can be forcibly removed from the State court and those rights that exist under State law are effectively divested from them. So in the hypothetical that I cite, a monstrous fraud, which may have cost the public employee retirement system literally millions and millions of dollars, discovered sometime after 3 years for the first time and filed timely under the law--it would be possible for the perpetrator 
of the fraud to actually get other plaintiffs to file to build up a number of 50, thereby removing the case from State jurisdiction. And once it gets to the Federal court, lo and behold, what happens: the hammer falls because at the Federal level, because of the Lampf decision, the statute of limitations is 3 years, the outside bar. 
So here you can have literally tens of thousands of public employees or teacher retirement funds or an Orange County type of investment in which you may have a million or more taxpayers who are unable to recover simply because the perpetrator of the fraud is allowed to remove the single case from State court jurisdiction. What is the fairness of that? 
The able and distinguished chairman of the committee says the SEC can bring the action. That is true. But we have been told on many, many occasions that the SEC simply does not have the resources; that both the current chairman and previous chairman, in the time I served with the distinguished chairman of the committee and my colleague and good friend from Connecticut, have repeatedly told us that the SEC simply does not have the resources to pursue all of the fraud out there, and therefore the private cause of action is an absolutely essential and critical part of the regulatory structure, the structure that has created the safest and most efficient market in the world. 
Why are we making these changes? Because we are told that we must worship at the shrine of uniformity, that there is a rush to the courthouse door; 44 cases out of 15 million is a rush to the courthouse door? Many, many States have had no cause of action filed at all, at all. I think in my own State of Nevada there has been one. A rush? I must say, I do not think that makes the argument. 
If uniformity is an end to itself, isn't it a fairly persuasive argument to say 49 of the 50 States have laws that hold aiders and abettors liable? These are the accomplices, these are the lawyers, the accountants, the investment advisers who participated with the primary individual involved in the fraud to create the loss to the innocent investor--49 out of 50 States say those people ought to be liable, too. They are not, under the 1995 legislation. So if uniformity is to be the standard by which this debate is to be judged, what is wrong with that uniformity? 
What we have here, and I regret to say this, it is a systematic attempt to close the courtroom door to innocent investors, small investors in this particular instance that we are debating here. We are talking about an institutional investor who could be taken involuntarily to the Federal court. I don't understand the public policy argument that says that is somehow meritorious. I concede that maybe you could argue preemption if you develop a broader statute of limitations at the Federal level to protect them. Maybe that is a possibility. Maybe we could reach a compromise there. Then maybe you could argue preemption. 
But the proponents of this measure--with due respect to my colleague from Connecticut, he does support a longer statute of limitation--but the primary thrust of getting this legislation, the folks who have opposed and resist this, have resisted the longer statute of limitations. So, in effect, we take two weapons away from the small investor: The right at the Federal level to a longer statute of limitations--Lampf took that weapon away from the small investor--and now we are going to go one step further and take it away from that small investor who is filing at the State level, not as part of a class action but as an individual. And I must say I think the unfairness of that is --all of this is being done in the name of, whether it is 39 cases or 44 cases out of 15 million, filed annually. 
I come from a part of the country where we understand what `rush' is. The gold rush. There was an exodus of people coming out West. But 44 people? I wouldn't call that a gold rush. That would be a trickle. 
So I must say, this is a terribly, terribly important investor protection. My colleague from Maryland and I, we know how to count the votes. We know this legislation is going to pass. But even if you are for this legislation, please, please, I implore you to consider what you do to the small investor who is filing in State court. He or she gets involuntarily wiped out by the perpetrator of fraud by removing that case to the Federal court system where the shorter statute of limitations prevails. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I don't want to prolong this debate unnecessarily. I realize several of my colleagues have time constraints. 
Let me say I think the Senator from Maryland has crafted an amendment that is eminently fair. He is using the definition of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The notion that we get involved in describing what is a class action based upon an arbitrary number of individual plaintiffs--some of whom could be private citizens, some could be pension funds, and could be State agencies--makes no sense to me. 
So I believe, in trying to provide some sense of balance and fairness--so we do not get a situation where we have discussed throughout a good part of the afternoon that an individual who files an action by himself or herself with his or her lawyer alone, no other coplaintiffs involved, immediately after the discovery of a fraud, that would be 3 to 3 years and 2 months after the fraud occurred--should be allowed to pursue that cause of action and not be involuntarily sucked up into Federal court because 49 other people may have filed similar action, and to give to the errant defendant, the perpetrator of the fraud, the ability to manipulate the process so that the perpetrator of the fraud can file some phony plaintiff's actions, getting up to the threshold of 50, and then have the case removed, the individual plaintiff, the individual pension fund, the individual retirement fund, then having been effectively deprived of pursuing a cause of action that may be meritorious without question. 
I certainly urge my colleagues to thoughtfully reflect. This is the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. They have been around since 1939. Why should we craft some kind of a special rule as to what constitutes a class action, the effect of which deprives individuals--not people filing on behalf of a similarly situated class, but individuals--their opportunity to recover on a fraud perpetrated upon them. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I thank the chairman for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, this is a vote that I believe that my colleagues who support the measure--and I am not unmindful of how the votes lie--will live to rue. At a time when investor fraud is mounting with billions and billions of dollars, we have a consistent, steady course of action where we are systematically depriving individual small investors from protections. 
This adds a further limitation to the statute of limitations. And 37 out of the 50 States provide a greater remedy. This provides a limitation in terms of the ability of an investor to file an action against an accomplice. And 49 out of 50 States provide that remedy. We take that away in this course of action. 
Most States provide a remedy for joint and several liability so that an investor who is defrauded may recover the full amount of his or her loss from any one of the individual investors. If this legislation had been in place at the time of the Keating fraud, where Keating himself was, in effect, judgment proof, there would have been no ability to recover against the fraudulent activity of the accomplices--the accountants, the lawyers, and others. 
That is why, contrary to the assertion by the proponents, this is not a plaintiff's lawyer's argument that is being made in opposition to this. There are some abuses, and we should confine ourselves to that. That is why all of the governmental institutions who are charged with their public responsibility as stewards of investment funds, retirement funds, municipalities, school districts, States, all have expressed their opposition to the legislation, because they recognize that the taxpayer, himself or herself, is frequently defrauded by this course of action. 
So this is a bad piece of legislation. And we continue on a slippery slope in eliminating basic investor protections. The small guys get dealt out of the game with this legislation. The victims, they can take care of themselves. But for the millions and millions of small investors who have confidence in our markets, who are coming in--one out of every three in the country--they are the big losers in this legislation.

plaintiff lawyers. That is not the argument, as the Senator from Maryland and I and others who oppose this legislation know. We are talking about protecting small investors in America who, I believe, are left with fewer defenses as a result of this.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, April 15, the day on which we pay our annual tribute to the IRS, will never be one of the happiest days on the calendar for Americans. It is a time in which all of us are required to pay that which we owe to the Federal Government by way of the tax system that we, as Members of the Congress, have imposed upon the American people. 
We have heard in the past few days a number of the abuses that have been foisted upon the American public, and I will speak to those issues in more detail in a moment. In the meantime, we have an opportunity to pass a reform and restructuring piece of legislation which, as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased to support and endorse, and I hope we can get this to the President for his signature as soon as possible. 
Many of us believe that it would have been possible to have passed this legislation last year so that the benefits that are provided in this legislation to the American taxpayer could have been available in the early part of this year before this year's tax collections went into effect. Nevertheless, we do have an opportunity to move forward on this important piece of legislation. 
Reform of the IRS is not a partisan issue. In my judgment, by acting quickly on this legislation, we can provide some much-needed protections and service improvements to the American taxpayers. 
I think it is fair to acknowledge that the problems with the IRS are not of recent origin or vintage. They have existed for many years. But it does seem to me that the timing for change is most fortuitous an opportunity for us to pass a broad, far-reaching IRS reform bill in a time when we have a Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Rossotti, who has a unique and, I believe, highly qualified background to help us implement these changes. 
Mr. Rossotti, unlike his distinguished predecessors, is not a man with a tax or an accounting background, but brings a distinctive business perspective. Many of the problems of the IRS deal with fundamental change of structure, so I believe that his background provides a unique opportunity, combined with this legislation, to produce the kind of changes which will benefit the American public and which Democrats and Republicans alike are prepared to embrace. 
Already, in the few short months that he has served as our Commissioner, he has demonstrated a commitment to reform and change, and I believe that is highly encouraging. 
Our responsibility as Members of Congress, in my view, is to give Commissioner Rossotti the tools that he needs to do the job, and the legislation before the Senate today does just that. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, the public today is more aware than ever of the types of abuses we need to correct in the IRS. 
Last week's hearings in particular reveal that the agency is in serious need of reform. I think all Americans were truly shocked and outraged by the testimony that we heard. 
The task of collecting taxes is always a difficult one, but little, if any, circumstances would dictate the strong-armed, 
police-style tactics that we listened to last week were necessary in dealing with the taxpayers who testified before the Finance Committee. 
The IRS, like any other agency, should attempt to use the least intrusive, the least confrontational method available to carrying out its duties. 
Having said that, the abuses that we heard last week, I think, engendered the justifiable outrage by all of us, but there are those who are part of our country who are involved in criminal and other kind of nefarious activities, and so we must, at the time we reform this agency, not deprive the agency of the ability to move against those who are truly involved in either criminal conspiracies or other kind of activities in which they are underpaying their taxes. 
Each of us who pay our taxes on time as required--and that is the vast majority of the American people--will suffer the consequences if changes that we bring into the system makes it more difficult to collect from those who would evade the taxes. 
The consequence of that course of action will mean that all of us will pay more, not less, as a result of failing to collect taxes that are lawfully due pursuant to the IRS Code. So we clearly need to be mindful of that. 
That testimony, nevertheless, I think was shocking to most Americans and certainly to the members of the committee where dozens of armed, flak-jacketed agents raided well-established businesses and individuals. This clearly appears to be an agency, at least in respect to those circumstances that we were informed about last week, that is out of control. Nothing that we heard, assuming that there was a tax liability owed by the taxpayers who testified, justified that kind of egregious conduct. 
That kind of conduct gives a bad name to those 100,000 IRS employees who are decent, law-abiding citizens. They are our neighbors. They are our friends. They are involved in the civic culture of our community. They are involved in Little League and all of the other activities that make up a community. But this kind of conduct is egregious, it is unacceptable, and it cannot be allowed to continue. 
I believe that the chairman and the committee have produced a strong bill that will give the Commissioner the tools he needs to make real reforms in the IRS possible. I would like to spend a couple of minutes addressing several of those reforms. 
Establishing an IRS oversight board to provide input and oversight from the customers of the IRS, the American taxpayer, in addition to those who have responsibility for enforcing the Code, I believe, broadens the perspective of the oversight, and I fully support that provision. 
Providing some kind of continuity for the Commissioner, as this legislation provides a 5-year term, I think is important for the stability and management of the agency. If, as I suspect, many of the agency's problems are deep-seated, institutional and cultural in nature, it is very difficult for an IRS Commissioner, no matter what his enthusiasm or her enthusiasm for reform might be, to make those kinds of changes in a couple of years. It takes a longer period of time to turn around a bureaucracy that is as large and encrusted as the IRS. 
It will strengthen the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate by ensuring that the taxpayer advocate is truly independent from the IRS bureaucracy and increasing the ability of the taxpayer advocate to provide relief to taxpayers. 
We have sought in the past, by establishing such an office, to provide that kind of assistance to the American taxpayer, but I believe candor requires us to acknowledge that we have fallen short of the mark, because the perception, if not the reality, is that the taxpayer advocate of the past is still part of the IRS structure, and the individual who holds that position looks to his or her future--the IRS itself--and therefore has been reluctant to aggressively intervene on behalf of the American taxpayer who has a legitimate grievance or issue to raise. 
It will enhance oversight of IRS activities by strengthening the Treasury Inspector General Office. We heard much in the last week about employees who have complained about misconduct on the part of some of their coemployees, reporting this misconduct only to be ignored. Hopefully, a more effective oversight responsibility on the part of the inspector general's office will provide assurance that those comments and concerns--shared, as I have indicated, by the vast majority of employees of the IRS who are responsible, dedicated public servants who, as we were abhorred by what we heard, they, too, are greatly troubled by that kind of misconduct on the part of the few employees who engage in that type of excessive conduct.  
This legislation requires the IRS to use fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers as a basis for employee evaluation. 
Mr. President, one of the ongoing concerns in my own State has been the so-called quota system. This Congress has in the past attempted to send a message indicating that the quota system can no longer be used either to evaluate employees or as part of a collection tool. 
Unhappily, notwithstanding those earlier directions from the Congress, we found last year as we were beginning our discussion of the reform measures in the Finance Committee that indeed, in the district in Nevada, such quotas were in fact being used, although they were not described as quotas. From all appearances, those who are part of the evaluating process could, in my judgment, have reached no other conclusion but that their performance would be judged by the amount of money that would be extracted from each taxpayer who came to the office by reason of some conflict or disagreement as to the amount of revenue that the taxpayer owed. 
A quota system is inherently wrong and unfair because it engenders a confrontational attitude. That is to say, the IRS revenue officer looks at the taxpayer not as a consumer, one who has a problem that needs to be addressed, but basically as an individual that the revenue agent must collect a certain amount of taxes from in order to be evaluated positively by his or her superiors for purposes of tenure or promotion within the system. 
I have to say that once we called this practice to the attention of the Acting IRS Commissioner at the time, he was forceful in his denunciation, as is Mr. Rossotti, our new director. But, nevertheless, notwithstanding directions from the past, these quotas were still there. That needs to be changed. And I believe that we provide not only the specifics, but the tenure in this legislation that directs that to be accomplished. 
This legislation establishes goals for increased electronic filing, which offers benefits to both the taxpayers and the IRS. If there is a part of this cloud that has a shining moment, it is in the system that has been created that allows for telefiling. It is a system available to millions of taxpayers, a paperless system that allows the taxpayer to get his or her refund, if one is due, much quicker than the old process. It relieves an enormous paperwork burden on the part of the IRS. So it is a win-win, a win for the taxpayer and a win for the IRS. I am pleased to see that more taxpayers are availing themselves of this. And electronic filing also provides simplification for the taxpayer as well as for the IRS, and that practice has increased as well. 
By shifting the burden of proof in certain cases where the taxpayer has cooperated with the IRS in providing all documentation to a tax case, again, it has the effect of leveling the playing field for the taxpayer in an issue of dispute or controversy with the IRS. 
Expanding the opportunity for taxpayers to recover reasonable costs and attorney's fees when a taxpayer prevails over the IRS--this, too, levels the playing field and is in the essence of fair play. 
Enhancing the ability of taxpayers to recover civil damages when they are victims of IRS abuse or negligence--this provision that we have added to the code treats taxpayers more equitably by eliminating interest rate differentials between many overpayments and underpayments so that the taxpayer is treated as the IRS is treated for purposes of interest payments 
that may be due as a result of money owed to the taxpayer. 
The bill that we have before us provides relief from certain penalties when a taxpayer is making a good-faith effort to pay past due taxes. 
This legislation enhances due process rights prior to seizures and levies and improves the ability of taxpayers to take advantage of `offers in compromise' and installment agreements. 
This legislation increases disclosure to taxpayers of reasons for IRS actions, including providing reasons for denying a refund and clearly informing taxpayers of their rights during audits or other IRS procedures, thereby making the process less mystifying and secretive but more open and understood by the American taxpayer. 
It requires all IRS correspondence to identify by name, phone number, and address, and to provide the IRS contact regarding the correspondence, and to require the Joint Tax Committee to analyze the change in tax complexity of legislation being considered by the Congress.  
Mr. President, there is plenty of blame to spread around regarding the many problems with the IRS. It is certainly clear that for far too long a culture has existed within the agency that views the taxpayer as the adversary rather than as the customer. Overcoming this taxpayer-hostile culture is not something that we can accomplish instantaneously through legislative fiat, but I believe if we give Commissioner Rossotti the tools he needs to do his job, problems in this agency can be resolved and long-entrenched attitudes can be changed. 
Most of the more than 100,000 employees of the IRS are conscientious public servants dedicated to doing their job in a fair, impartial, and effective manner. With strong leadership from the top, increased taxpayer protections and increased flexibility to reward employees who do their job well and to, conversely, penalize those who do not, I think, are what this agency needs before it can be turned around. 
The IRS will never be the most popular Federal agency. But if, by passing this legislation, we ensure that honest, hard-working taxpayers are treated fairly and with respect by the IRS, we will have made a major improvement. I do not mean to suggest that by simply passing this legislation we will solve every problem with the IRS. Of course, that is not the case. 
A great part of the problems with the IRS rests with this body, the Congress itself. The code is extraordinarily complex, difficult to administer, ambiguous in parts, uncertain in terms of its intended consequence. With every good intention Congress has had, for many, many years the IRS Tax Code has become more complicated, not less so. I want to be clear that I supported the changes in the Tax Code that were part of the balanced budget agreement last year. But last year's tax bill is a good example of the code becoming more complex. 
While I believe that there were many solid policy reasons for every provision of last year's bill, no one can argue that last year's legislative enactment will provide for tax simplification. It has made the code more complex. And in recent weeks on the floor of this Chamber, we have heard proposals being offered on behalf of some of the educational issues that have been debated that will make the code even more complicated. 
The bill before the Senate today will, however, provide great improvements in the management of the IRS. And until such time as we can provide for a simpler Tax Code that can be more effectively administered, we have a responsibility to provide the necessary tools so that the code can be more fairly enforced and implemented. 
Mr. President, I strongly support this legislation and hope the Senate will pass this bill in the near future. 
I note that the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska joins us on the floor and undoubtedly will have much to say. I would like to pay tribute to him and his congressional counterparts for the years that they spent as part of a review of this Tax Code, the testimony they heard, the stories that were told to them. The genesis for this reform lies largely with the action of the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey. 
I acknowledge that. All of us ought to be grateful. 
He and Senator Grassley and others, in a bipartisan way, during the interim, took the many hours out of their time to canvas some of the more outrageous and objectionable provisions of the code, some of the practices that have occurred over the years, the injustices that have occurred. The legislation that they framed, which is the basis for action today, moves us a long way in the direction of reform. 
The American people ought to be very grateful to him, Senator Grassley, and others, for their efforts in moving this reform along the way. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will correct some misimpressions that may have been unintentionally offered here on the floor of the Senate. I think it is helpful to put this 
in some context. 
This proposal, which has been offered by the Senator from Arkansas on previous occasions, was in my idea never a good idea, but now the timing could not be worse because the status of at least one aspect of that industry, the gold industry in my State, is facing some very critical times. The international price of gold on the markets of the world has dropped precipitously, substantially below $300 an ounce. The break-even cost in the gold industry is approximately $296, so in my own State of Nevada, which leads the Nation and is one of the largest gold-producing areas in the entire world, we have had just in the last year more than 2,000 layoffs and a substantial number of mines that have closed, and the spot price of gold has been as low as $283 an ounce. So this is a very, very difficult time for this industry. 
The proposal offered by the Senator from Arkansas would, indeed, have a catastrophic impact upon the industry, and it would have a serious impact upon thousands of people in my own State. About 120,000 people in America work directly in the hardrock mining industry. In the State of Nevada, more than 15,000 have been employed at the high-level mark before these layoffs occurred. These are good-paying jobs. We talk a lot in America about good jobs that provide a full range of benefits, an adequate salary base to provide a decent living standard for America's workers. The average wage for mining in my State is nearly $49,000 a year. That is higher by far than any other industry. 
Finally, let me conclude by saying that the impression given that somehow the mining industry gets a free ride, doesn't have to pay any taxes, could not be further from the truth. The Natural Mining Association last year estimates that over $600 million in Federal taxes was paid. According to a recent GAO report, the average tax rate for the mining industry from 1987 to 1992 was 35 percent. That is compared with other industries: the auto industry, 23 percent; chemical industry, 19 percent; 33 percent for the transportation industry. In my own State, the gold industry paid more than $141 million in State and local taxes in 1995, including $32.7 million in property taxes. 
I note my time has expired. I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I rise today in support of the Reid/Bryan amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that Federal public lands should not be sold to fund the landowner incentive program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act. 
As some of my colleagues are aware, the budget resolution before us today assumes the landowner incentive program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act will be enacted. The landowner incentive program includes habitat reserve agreements, safe harbor agreements, habitat conservation plans, and recovery plan implementation agreements within the Act. The report accompanying the budget resolution calls for funding for these programs to be made available `from the gross receipts realized in the sales of excess BLM land, provided that BLM has sufficient administrative funds to conduct such sales.' 
Mr. President, this proposal is a short-sighted attempt to find a solution to a very legitimate issue. I support efforts to find a sustainable funding mechanism to provide incentives to landowners to undertake conservation measures that are necessary for the protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species. The problem with the proposal before us today is that it fails to establish a reliable source of funding. The one-time sales of BLM lands cannot be expected to provide a revenue source for habitat conservation plans and other landowner incentive programs that are designed to last for 50 years or longer. This proposal is a classic example of selling a capital asset to pay for operation and maintenance costs. In my opinion, it represents the utmost in fiscal irresponsibility. 
In addition, this proposal would set a dangerous precedent regarding the management of our public lands by threatening the public land base available to future generations of Americans. Currently, the land disposal method favored the BLM involves land exchanges. This process allows the BLM to dispose of land it no longer needs in exchange for land that is worthy of public ownership. The land exchange process allows the BLM to trade an asset it no longer deems desirable for one that it does. Ironically, the BLM often uses land exchanges as a means of acquiring critical habitat for threatened and endangered species. By disrupting the land exchange process, the land sale proposal in this resolution could actually weaken the federal government's ability to acquire private, environmentally sensitive land that rightfully belongs in public ownership. 
Mr. President, I am also concerned with this proposal because it would effectively eviscerate another piece of legislation that I have sponsored concerning the BLM land disposal process in Southern Nevada. It is no secret that the public lands that this budget resolution contemplates being sold are those BLM lands in the Las Vegas valley. I have worked closely with Senator Reid and our House delegation for the last three years to develop the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act, which provides local governments in southern Nevada with more input into the BLM land exchange and land sale process. Over the last several years, BLM land exchanges have contributed significantly to growth and development in the Las Vegas valley. My legislation would allow local governments and the BLM to work more closely together in managing growth in the valley. The land sale proposal in this budget resolution would destroy the ability of the Las Vegas community to have a voice in the BLM land sale process as envisioned under my legislation. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Reid/Bryan amendment and to reject the irresponsible sell off of our public lands as contained in this budget resolution.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I rise in respectful opposition to the amendment of my friend, the junior Senator from Arizona. Although this amendment is dressed in the robes of patient choice, in my view it dramatically changes the nature of the Medicare system and now, for the first time in more than three decades of Medicare experience, would give to the physician the ability to determine how much a Medicare patient pays for Medicare-covered services. I believe it is a prescription for disaster for the Medicare system and for the patient himself or herself. 
Let me put this in some context, if I may. For 30 years-plus Medicare patients have come to their physician and have known with reasonable certainty what kind of financial expectation they are required to pay in order to receive 
Medicare-covered benefits. This amendment would change that and allow the physician to make that determination. 
No. 2, we are plagued in the Medicare system today with fraud that some estimate may exceed $20 billion a year. I believe that this change would make it more complicated in addressing the problems of fraud that the system confronts. 
And, finally, for the Medicare patient himself or herself, I think it injects a notion of uncertainty and confusion when that Medicare patient goes to the physician. 
Let me put this in some context, as I understand it, so we can talk about what is not involved here. Since the inception of Medicare, and continuing beyond the 1998 balanced budget agreement for noncovered Medicare services--that would be, for example, plastic surgery--a Medicare patient has always had the right to enter into a private contractual arrangement with the physician of his or her choice. That is the history. That was unchanged by the balanced budget agreement of 1997, and it continues to be the law today. 
With respect to a Medicare-covered service, such as a diagnostic test in which Medicare pays for only one or two of those diagnostic tests, if a Medicare patient is uncertain as to the kind of advice he or she is getting as a consequence of that test, it has always been the case that if a second or third or fourth opinion is sought by the Medicare patient, that Medicare patient has the right to enter into a private contractual arrangement with the physician of his or her choice. That has been true historically. That was true prior to the balanced budget agreement and remains the case as well. 
Thirdly, this applies to part B Medicare, so we are not talking about the trust fund. For an individual who is philosophically opposed or for whatever reason chooses not to be a part of Medicare part B, that is his or her absolute choice. No one is required to participate or to pay that premium. And that is true with the physician as well. 
What I apprehend will occur here is a rather dramatic change in the Medicare system. A Medicare patient goes to a physician, and the Medicare physician says, `Look, there are three or four procedures which I believe you need. With respect to three of those procedures, I'm satisfied that the Medicare reimbursement schedule is adequate. As to the fourth, I will need additional compensation in order to provide that service.' 
The net effect of all of that, I respectfully submit, is that no Medicare patient, going to his or her doctor's office, will know with certainty what the financial expectation will be of that Medicare patient. That changes the system rather dramatically. 
For more than three decades, to the best of my ability, there has been no private contracting between Medicare patient and physician with respect to covered service. My distinguished colleague may be right that there may not be carved in stone any legal prescription, but that indeed has been the practice. And 96 percent of physicians in America cover and treat Medicare patients. So I think we ought to give a considerable reflection to what is at issue here. 
My distinguished friend and colleague offered in the balanced budget amendment an amendment which was ultimately fashioned into law. That provided, for the first time, an opportunity for a physician who wants to enter into a private contractual arrangement with a Medicare patient to do so. 
If the Medicare physician chooses to do so, then that Medicare physician may not have other Medicare patients for a period of 2 years. That was, in effect, an opening, if you will. That provided an expanded opportunity which did not heretofore exist. 
There are some groups who I think have been irresponsible in characterizing that as a limitation. That is not the case, as I understand it. 
I simply say to my colleagues, the Medicare system is not perfect. There are certainly some things which we need to do, and, indeed, the Medicare Commission has been formed for that purpose. Hopefully, it will come with some bipartisan recommendations. But I do not believe we will want to change dramatically the nature of that system which does have certainty; namely, a fee schedule for reimbursement to a physician for Medicare-covered services. That has been the hallmark of the Medicare system. That will change rather dramatically if the proposal which my friend from Arizona offers is accepted, and would allow not the patient, but the physician, to make that judgment. 
Most of us, when we go to our physician, even those of us who might be described as being in the `pre-Medicare age'--that is, we are not quite eligible for Medicare services--approach the annual visit to our physician with some trepidation. A physician has the ability to say, `Look, that condition that you have is terminal.' So there is some apprehension, some ill at ease, no matter how many times you have been to a doctor. When you are in that context, it is not a level playing field, and the doctor saying to you, `Look, I no longer accept this rate of reimbursement from Medicare which I previously accepted,' places, in my view, the patient at a decided disadvantage in dealing with that physician and is more likely than not to say, `Well, all right, I will agree to pay.' 
As I indicated previously, if there are two or three Medicare services that the patient requires, the confusion of, `I will accept Medicare reimbursement for two of the services but not a third,' I think leaves the patient in a very confused situation. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Let's all work together as a result of the Medicare Commission and see what kind of changes we need to make to improve the system. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, what is at issue here is whether States, through their elected Governors and State legislatures, will determine what the scope of gaming is in a particular State, or whether that decision should be made by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior has proceeded with regulations that are subject to public comment and are currently being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget that, in effect, would constitute a preemptive strike. That is, the Secretary of the Interior would determine the scope of Indian gaming. We believe that is inappropriate. 
This amendment seeks to reaffirm a policy which the Congress agreed to last year; and that is that the Congress should retain the authority to make any changes in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs has indicated that he intends to move forward with the piece of legislation. I assured him that we will work cooperatively with him about what the Secretary of the Interior has done. Notwithstanding the actions taken by the Congress last year, which would prevent the implementation of a regulation which would give to him the ability to establish the scope of gambling activity in a State contrary to what I believe is the clear intent of the Congress, this amendment simply says he may not go forward at this point with the processing of those regulations. So completely consistent with what we agreed to last year, no compact that currently exists between any tribe or any Governor is affected. We in Nevada have five such compacts. Many other States have compacts as well. 
What is involved here is not a question of bad faith between a Governor and a tribe. It is that several tribes, particularly in the State of California and in the State of Florida, have been pressing Governors to provide Indian tribes with the ability to conduct gaming activities that are prohibited under State law. In the State of Florida, for example, there have been three public referendums. And the public in Florida has rejected open casino gaming, as my State of Nevada has adopted. The tribes, nevertheless, pressed forward and challenged the Governor of Florida, accusing him of bad faith in not being willing to negotiate such gaming activity. 
My view is that it is a province that ought to be left to the State Governors and the elected State legislatures. In California, currently 20 tribes have 14,000 illegal slot machines, contrary to State law. The Governor of California has recently negotiated a compact with the Pala Band of Indian tribes that do not permit, as some tribes want, slot machines in California. California's Governor and its State legislature ought to make the determination. 
So what this amendment does is to preempt the Secretary of the Interior from making that decision and retains the authority and jurisdiction in the Congress. If there are to be changes in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, if there are perceived shortcomings, let us in a deliberative fashion make those changes --not the Secretary of the Interior. 
As I have indicated, I look forward to working with my colleagues who serve on that committee. 
I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of the time to be allocated by the distinguished Senator from Wyoming on our side of the issue.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank you. 
I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, who has not had an opportunity to speak. If he wishes to precede me, I would be happy to yield. 
Mr. President, I think it is helpful to our colleagues if we put this amendment in some context. 
In 1988, the Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. That act says that to the extent that States permit gaming activities within the States, that Indian tribes within those States should have the same opportunity. Let me say that I am in support of that philosophy. 
In Nevada, we have a full range of casino gaming activity. There is no question in my State that tribes within Nevada have the same opportunity, and, indeed, we have five compacts that have been ratified between the Governor and the tribes in my State permitting those tribes to conduct the same kind of activity for gaming enterprises that we have in Nevada. 
Let me give a contrast, if I may. My friend from Hawaii and our colleagues from Utah--in those two States a determination has been made that no form of gaming activity should be permitted, something that I believe is a matter of public policy for those two States to make a determination. So it is equally clear under the act that Indian tribes would have no opportunity to participate in Indian gaming unless the States chose to permit it because they have made a public policy not to have any form of gaming. 
In between, there are 48 other States that have adopted variations of gaming. So there are a number of States that have entered into compacts; that is, agreements between Governors and tribes. The Enzi-Bryan-Reid amendment in no way impacts those States that have previously entered into compacts. Those are valid and continue to be effective. 
What is at issue here is that some tribes, particularly in California and Florida, have tried to force the respective Governors of those States to permit gambling activity, which those States do not permit, specifically in the form of slot machines. California has made a determination that they do not, as a matter of public policy, favor slot machines, so therefore slot machines are not permitted in California. In Florida, the same public policy prevails. And the tribes have sought to force those Governors to negotiate this kind of gambling activity. 
In California today, there are 40 tribes that operate 14,000 illegal slot machines, slot machines that are not part of negotiated compacts. Recently, the Governor of California and the Pala Band Indian Tribe have entered into a compact that does not, Mr. President, include the gambling activity that currently illegally exists in these 20 reservations; namely, slot machines. 
What is troublesome to my colleagues who join me on this amendment and what was of concern to the Congress in the last session is the Secretary of the Interior has moved forward with regulations that would say the Governors and the tribes are not the ones to determine the scope of gaming in a given State; the Secretary of the Interior should have that right. 
So in the Interior appropriations bill that was approved last year, we offered a provision that said, in effect, the Secretary of Interior is prohibited from expending any money to implement a regulation which would give to him the authority to be the final arbiter between a tribe and a State as to what should be negotiated. 
What causes our renewed concern is, the Secretary of Interior has now begun a rulemaking process that has been out for public comment, that is currently before the Office of Management and Budget for review, that is doing the very sort of thing that we sought to prohibit in the appropriations bill last year. 
What this amendment does is to reaffirm the policy of the Congress that the Secretary of Interior shall not move forward in overriding, if you will, a determination between a Governor and the tribe as to the scope of gaming. I am familiar with no circumstance--none--in which a Governor today has refused to negotiate in good faith for gambling activity on a tribal reservation that is consistent with that State's public policy. So what we are really talking about here are tribes that have been putting a lot of pressure on Governors to, in effect, open up casino gaming, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama pointed out. I believe that is a determination the States, the Governors, ought to make. 
The law is clear, once a State crosses the Rubicon and permits a form of gaming, the tribal governments within that State should be entitled to the same. That is fair. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is no quarrel with that. 
But the tribes have sought to push some of the Governors and say, `Look, we want slot machines. Even though you do not permit that as a matter of public policy, we believe you ought to be required to negotiate that, and if you won't negotiate that, we will accuse you of acting in bad faith and will go to the Secretary of Interior and have him make that determination.' 
I believe however we line up on the political spectrum in this Chamber, that is not a decision that the Secretary of Interior ought to be making. That is a decision which the State, as a matter of public policy, should determine for itself--how much, how little, if any, gaming activity should be allowed. 
What our amendment does is to refine the amendment that was offered as part of the appropriation process and goes further and says, `Look, you shall not go forward with this rulemaking process,' in the context of the appropriations for this year. I believe that is totally consistent with what we began last year, and I believe it is something this Chamber ought to reaffirm. 
My concern is that the rate in which this rulemaking process is proceeding is, the day after the current appropriations bill expires, October 1, we have a regulation out there and the Secretary of Interior will begin to make determinations as to the scope of gaming permitted in States. May I say in the two States in question, one of them presided over by a Democrat, one by a Republican, this is bipartisan. Both of those Governors have resisted that. The National Governors Association has gone on record as opposing the Secretary of Interior's position, the National Association of Attorneys General has gone on record as opposing it, Democrats and Republicans in both of those two associations, because in effect the Secretary of Interior would be allowed to preempt 
State public policy. That is something that I believe none of us would want to occur. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am dismayed to hear that there are continuing efforts to process through this Congress an ill-conceived piece of legislation that would establish a temporary nuclear waste dump in my State at the Nevada test site. I believe those efforts will be defeated, and I believe that the policy indications overwhelmingly indicate that is an ill-conceived piece of legislation. 
Most of the debate that has occurred on this floor in this session and the previous session has been by my colleague Senator Reid and I in discussing this with other Members of this body, and the issue has frequently been framed that it is Nevada versus the rest of the country. 
I want to enlighten my colleagues this morning on some developments that I think are most interesting. The voices of the average citizen in America have not been heard in this debate. In fact, a recent poll commissioned by the University of Maryland indicates that slightly more than 35 percent of Americans, when questioned about this ill-conceived proposal, know anything about it at all. So my colleagues have not heard from the public. 
The nuclear energy industry and its advocates and supporters have been a massive presence on Capitol Hill. Their voices have been heard. Their power and their influence through the Halls of Congress have been immense. I freely acknowledge that they are a frightening and impressive adversary in terms of the resources that they bring to bear. 
But again, about 35 percent of the American people are even aware of this proposal at all. 
Under the commission survey by the University of Maryland, when Americans are told about this proposal, and they are asked about this concept of transporting high-level nuclear waste throughout the country, 66 percent express opposition. And of the 66 percent who expressed opposition, 75 percent were strongly opposed. 
I hope, as this debate is likely to resume during the present Congress, that my colleagues will hear the voice of their constituents. They know that this is bad policy, they know it is unsafe, and they know that it is unnecessary once the facts are freely laid out for them. 
Mr. President, you will recall, during the course of the debate we made the point here that in order to transport high-level nuclear waste to the so-called temporary site at the Nevada test site, it must pass through 43 States and that 50 million Americans live within a mile or less of the major rail and highway corridors in America. The red lines depicted on this map of the United States indicate the highway corridors. The blue lines indicate the rail corridors. 
One does not have to be a student of geography to understand that these highway and rail corridor systems make their way through the major metropolitan centers of our country. Indeed, they are arteries of commerce that connect the major cities of our country. So in transporting high-level nuclear waste, that waste is going to go through the major metropolitan areas of our country. When citizens in those communities are made aware of this peril, they react without reference to partisanship but to strongly express their opposition. 
We have communities such as St. Louis, Denver, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, Philadelphia, and other communities that have passed ordinances expressing their strong opposition. What brings me to the floor this morning is that just earlier this week in Flagstaff, AZ, its city council passed a resolution expressing its strong opposition to this proposal. 
It is unnecessary. It is opposed by the scientific community. It is opposed by the Department of Energy. It is opposed by sensible Americans who have looked at the issue because it is unnecessary. Transporting 70,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste across the country to a temporary facility makes no public policy sense at all. As we have pointed out time and time again on the floor, this is not a new proposal. The origin of this proposal can be traced to one group and one group only, and that is the nuclear utility industry. Two decades ago they came before the Congress and urged the Congress to pass what was then referred to as an away-from-reactor program to remove the nuclear waste from the reactor sites and place it in some other facility off-location, off-reactor, as it was referred to. But Congress wisely rejected that proposal two decades ago. 
I might say that the arguments then, as now, are that catastrophe will occur in America if this is not transported to some temporary location away from reactor sites. In the 1980s, it was asserted that we would have a nuclear brownout, that these utilities would simply be unable to function because they did not have onsite storage if these shipments were not made. It is now two decades later. No nuclear utility in America has closed as a result of the absence of storage capacity onsite. Many have closed because they are unsafe. Others have closed because, from an economic point of view, to retrofit older reactors to bring them up to the safety standards that are required is simply uneconomical. 
Many of my colleagues find it difficult to accept, but the nuclear industry is an energy dinosaur in America. No new reactors have been ordered or built in America in two decades. I think it is highly unlikely, in light of increased public knowledge and understanding of what is involved in siting a reactor in a community, that we will ever again have a new reactor built in America. 
So when the public is presented with the facts--namely, are you aware that the Congress is considering in this session of the Congress a proposal to transport nuclear waste through 40 States, 50 million Americans within a mile or less; and what do you think of that proposal?--the overwhelming reaction, two-thirds, expressed strong opposition. 
My point, Mr. President, in bringing this to the floor today is that I hope my colleagues will listen to their constituents and hear from them. We have heard the arguments of the nuclear utility industry. But the American public, by and large, because they did not know about this proposal, we have not heard their voices. I can tell you, having been to St. Louis and Denver, when you talk with citizens in those communities, and make them aware of what is involved here, they understand the risk and they express strong opposition to this proposal. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct. As you have mentioned, the Lake Tahoe Basin consists of parts of two states, 4 counties, 3 National Forests, and one city. However, as the Bi-State Compact recognizes, the Basin has unique environmental needs that require the cooperation of all people and groups that own or manage property within the Basin. 
The ability to compete for and utilize federal transportation planning dollars will allow the Basin to fulfill many of the goals identified in the Basin's Environmental Improvement Program.

Mr. BRYAN. I agree with the Senator. Our legislation addresses the fact that the federal government is the biggest property owner in the Basin. As such, there is a need for federal involvement in both the planning and program implementation of transportation projects at Lake Tahoe. Our amendment gives the Basin access to both planning and program implementation funds for programs of federal land management agencies, such as the U.S. Forest Service. 
President Clinton made it clear last summer that the U.S. federal government must fulfill its obligations within the Tahoe Basin. Although this amendment does not include a seat on the MPO for the U.S. Department of Transportation, this provision would provide a role for U.S. DOT to assist in fulfilling these obligations by assisting the federal land management agencies in preparation of transportation plans.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, let me just express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the committee for the leadership which he has provided us and for the bipartisan approach he has taken in crafting the amendment which is before us. I would like to associate myself with his comments and observations with respect to the so-called `industry exceptions' in airbag provisions. 
There are generic provisions that provide for pilot projects which I think is appropriate. And, as the Senator has pointed out, a commitment was made during the markup to try to work out some of the concerns that have been voiced by some of our colleagues who want these wider exceptions in airbags. Unfortunately, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, we have not yet reached an agreement on those areas. But I want to work with him, and I pledge my support in trying to fashion a compromise that does not emasculate the safety provisions and give blanket exceptions and waivers under the provisions of the amendment which is currently part of the amendment which has been proffered. 
Let me also acknowledge and compliment the chairman on his leadership in bringing those of us together who have worked for many years on the airbag legislation. That legislation has its genesis in the 1991 ISTEA markup, at which time the senior Senator from Washington and I worked to incorporate those airbag provisions into the legislation. We recognize, as do all Members, that the unexpected infant fatality count as a result of by and large the inappropriate placement of infant seats has caused the problem that we want to respond to. I believe, under 
Senator McCain's leadership, he brought a group of us together, and through several sessions we have worked out a compromise that is part of this legislation. I am pleased to endorse it. 
So I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from Arizona as we process this part of the highway legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I want to preface my remarks by thanking the leadership on both sides of the political aisle, the able and distinguished chairman, Senator Chafee, as well as the able and distinguished ranking member, Senator Baucus, for an agreement which has put an additional $26 billion in terms of contract authority into this legislation that we are processing. This is no inconsiderable accomplishment. I recognize that leadership effort lasted for a number of months. It involved Senators Phil Gramm, Senator Byrd, and others. But this is a very important thing. It is bipartisan. I am pleased to support that effort. 
There are many Federal programs that provide important services to the States. But, as a former Governor, I can tell you that there is no Federal program that is more important than the highway program. 
In addition, the funding mechanism for Federal transportation funding--the gas tax--creates an even great and moral and ethical obligation for us to do our work, and to provide a long-term reauthorization of ISTEA. 
The mechanism that my colleague has chosen in putting this compromise together; namely, using the highway component of the additional 4.3 cent gas tax to provide this additional contract authority, I think is particularly appropriate and very sound and a sensible means to provide that enhanced contract authority. 
Although Nevada is still small by the national standard, in the last decade we have experienced the most rapid growth rate of any State in the Nation. 
Although there are still plenty of sparsely populated, wide-open spaces, we have also become the most heavily urbanized State. While in many respects this tremendous growth has been a positive development, the growth has brought with it a host of infrastructure demands that we are currently struggling to meet. 
Perhaps the greatest current need in Nevada is highway improvements. Our limited interstate system and other Federal highways were largely designed in the 1950s and early 1960s when Nevada was a far different place than it is today. Despite a tremendous effort by State and local governments over the past decade, nearly every one of the major arteries is currently operating far beyond its capacity, and there is no end in sight to the increased demand. 
We need more capacity on our highways, and the Federal Highway Program is a major partner in that effort. The highway needs of Nevada are even more acute when viewed in the context of our State's heavy dependency upon our largest industry, which is tourism. 
Despite our increased reliance on air travel, highways, particularly roads that connect us to our major markets in California, are the key to Nevada's commerce. Some of these major arteries, particularly I-15, Las Vegas' major connection to southern California, operate so far beyond capacity that they threaten to become an impediment to Nevada's incredible economic success story. 
In fact, one of the most important demonstration projects the Nevada delegation is pressing for in the pending legislation is a project outside our borders, and that is the widening of Interstate 15 in California from Barstow to Victorville. The passage of this ISTEA legislation is imperative, and sooner better than later. 
As we will recall, in the 1991 reauthorization we were successful in including funding for the `Spaghetti Bowl,' the most congested part of the downtown access in Las Vegas. Nearly 6 years later, the ground breaking for that project occurred late this last fall. That is an indicator of the time lag that it takes for us to get projects authorized and funded to contract and to construction. This time around, Nevada's highway needs are even greater than in 1991, and the projects we need to fund in the coming years dwarf the `Spaghetti Bowl' project which previously had been the largest highway project in our State's history. 
Throughout the State, in both northern and southern Nevada, many large and vital highway projects will need to be financed, and financed soon, and the Federal Government through the ISTEA formula is going to be an essential partner. 
In southern Nevada, the State plans to expand the major artery to the rapidly growing northwest sector of Clark County by greatly expanding the capacity of US-95. In northern Nevada, we need to complete the long-awaited connection between Reno and the State capital in Carson City along US-395, and Carson City itself needs a freeway bypass around the capital and commercial areas. We need money to build a new, safer bridge over the Colorado River, taking existing hazardous traffic off the Boulder Dam. 
Highways and roads are not the only transportation solutions in the works in Nevada. To an extent which would have been unthinkable only a few short years ago, we are becoming increasingly dependent on mass transit. Both of our major metropolitan areas, Las Vegas and Reno, have significant public bus and paratransit systems which make a major contribution to both mobility and air quality in their respective communities. 
The Citizen Area Transit system, or CAT, in southern Nevada, in particular, has been an incredible success story in only a few short years of operation, and it is currently planning on more than doubling its bus fleet in the next several years to more than 500 vehicles. CAT is also well along in the planning process for a major fixed guideway system serving the heavily traveled resort corridor. 
Both the bus fleet expansions and the fixed guideway system are counting on their fair share of Federal transportation dollars, something that will simply not be there any time soon if we do not finish our work on ISTEA as quickly as possible. 
The State of Nevada and the assorted local governments have all stepped up to the plate. We heard frequently in this partnership with the Federal and State and local governments that local governments must do their fair share. In Nevada, State and local governments have done their fair share. They have imposed some of the highest highway taxes in the Nation upon our residents to provide for those additional improvements which I have alluded to. 
What we are currently lacking is a solid, long-term commitment from the Federal Government as part of the Federal Government's requirement to live up to its partnership responsibilities. In fact, the Federal highway and transit programs are just that, they are bargains, commitments made with the American people. 
Unfortunately, in what has been a long source of frustration to me, first as a Governor and now as a U.S. Senator, the Federal Government has not lived up to its side of the bargain. Every time any one of us buys a gallon of gasoline, we pay 18.4 cents to the Federal Government, money that is supposed to be set aside and dedicated and spent for highway and transit improvements. As we all know, this is often not the case. Somehow, a good part of this funding never makes it back to the States for highway improvements. 
The trust fund balance now stands at more than $20 billion. By the year 2003, the balance of the trust fund could exceed $70 billion, all of which has essentially been taken from the American people under false pretenses; that is, the money is collected for highway improvements but not fully allocated for that purpose. I am hopeful with the compromise that has been effected that we will work to address what I believe is a failure of Federal responsibility. 
The time is right for us to increase transportation funding to levels that more accurately reflect the payments taxpayers have been making to the trust fund and to get to work on some of the very transportation and infrastructure problems facing our State and our Nation. Nothing can happen, of course, unless we complete ISTEA soon, and that is why I believe that it is one of the most important priorities for us to deal with in this session of the Congress. 
Again, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked out the compromise that has increased the contract authority by some $26 billion. That is something that every State will benefit from, and a State such as my own with a backlog of infrastructure needs will need this additional funding in order to complete these projects.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally discussing and debating the issue of campaign finance reform. I commend Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their diligent work and for what has been a tireless effort on their behalf in forging a bipartisan compromised legislation. I rise today not only to advocate my strong support of the McCain-Feingold bill but to urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pass this campaign finance reform proposal that is so desperately needed to renew the trust in the political process and our democratic institutions. At the same time, I know the Senate leadership and the majority of those on the other side of the aisle have decided there will be no campaign finance reform of any kind. And so, they have killed a reasonable attempt at urgently needed reform; an attempt to close greatly exploited loopholes. 
Along with the support of all 45 Democrats and the seven Republicans who support the effort of reform, the Senate Democratic Leader, Senator Daschle, pressed hard to bring this important issue back to the Senate floor for a vote. Despite the Republican leaders who oppose campaign finance reform and who have for so many years tried vigorously to thwart real reform, this legislation has strong support, including the backing of President Clinton. 
Last year when the Senate turned to campaign reform legislation, the Majority Leader offered an amendment to block campaign finance reform and followed through with a procedural motion to deadlock the Senate. It was an effort to kill campaign finance reform without debate and without a vote. However, later that year, the Majority and Minority Leaders struck a unanimous consent agreement that would afford us with the opportunity to once again debate and consider McCain-Feingold and other issues related to reform legislation, or so we thought. 
Mr. President, the Senate leadership this week has introduced the same poison pill legislation that was introduced last year as an amendment. Its sole purpose is to kill the cause of campaign finance reform. Once again, this is a clear indication that from the other side of the aisle that Republicans are not serious about reforming our campaign laws. 
Some of my colleagues may argue that campaign finance reform is not an important issue to the American voter; I expect we will hear this refrain from a number of my colleagues. But, is that really the case? Or are they just hoping and trying to make us believe that is the case? Because the polls tell us differently? 
The polls show Americans do care about the way their political system works. A full 83% of respondents to an October 1997 ABC News/Washington Post poll believed that campaign finance reform should be a goal for lawmakers. In a June NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, 62% of those questioned supported an overall reform package that called for reducing contributions from political action committees, establishing spending limits, and eliminating large contributions to political parties. 
The truth of the matter is campaign finance reform is a very important issue and the public does want reform. Yet, the polls also tell us that many American voters have become deeply cynical about whether their elected representatives will have the courage to check their own self interest and summon the courage to enact real campaign finance reform. In the ABC/Washington Post poll, when respondents were asked whether reform will occur, 59% answered `no.' This poll tells us that a large majority of Americans believe, once again, that politicians' self-interest will trump the public will. 
There is no reason to believe that the public's opinion is going to change. And why should it? After watching the enormous amount of money spent on the 1996 elections, the hearings held over the 1996 fund-raising controversy, and the aborted effort to pass campaign finance reform last year, it is likely that the public's cynicism will only continue to grow. 
Campaign finance reform is an issue that deserves our full consideration. It is our underlying responsibility to keep our own house in order, to begin to restore the integrity of the campaign system and to renew our faith in our democracy. If we miss this opportunity, and we do not heed the call to stem the ever-rising tide of money in American politics, then the confidence of the American public and the very fabric of our political system will only continue to erode. 
Mr. President, the time to begin the renewal is now, or last year when we were stopped. It is past time to restore the public trust and to pass campaign finance reform legislation. We could start by adopting the McCain-Feingold compromise bill. The revised McCain-Feingold legislation is a very modest but important proposal which was modified to attract Republican support. McCain-Feingold no longer limits PAC money. It does not establish spending limits. It does not impose free tv time for candidates and it does not provide postage discounts for candidates. The McCain-Feingold amendment that we are discussing today has been stripped down to the bare minimum of what needs most to be changed to stop the downward spiral of our political system. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal addresses two important issues that could begin to turn our campaign system around. The legislation proposes to ban soft money contributions to our national political parties and to curb the use of attack advertisements hidden behind so-called `issue advocacy' campaigns.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in the Chamber this week and I am sure in the next week a number of my colleagues will be talking about a January 31, 1998, deadline under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. And as I am sure my colleagues will know, there has been a recent flurry of newspaper ads and radio commercials indicating that was the deadline under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act for high-level nuclear waste to be accepted by the Department of Energy. I want to put those comments and those ads in some perspective so that no one should be misled by the assertions of the nuclear utility industry. 
The genesis of our current policy with respect to disposal of high-level waste traces its origins to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. It is true that in that piece of legislation it was contemplated the Department of Energy would be in a position to accept high-level nuclear waste, that a period of characterization and study would ultimately send three sites to the President of the United States and the President would select one of those sites. 
I think it is important to mention at the outset that even in 1982 a number of Department of Energy experts were uncomfortable, indeed, some were skeptical, that the 1998 deadline could be met, but they were overruled by politicians and the Department of Energy and others. 
My colleagues know from my previous statements in the Chamber that this process, whatever its original intent may have been, was politicized immediately. Within the first few weeks after the legislation was enacted, States such as my own, and at that time the State that the distinguished occupant of the Chair represents, the State of Washington, the State of Texas, and others, were denied oversight funds as contemplated in the act and litigation was commenced to gather those funds. 
That was an ominous beginning of what later turned out to be an entirely political nonscientific process. The original law contemplated that the entire country would be examined and that, indeed, various types of geological formations would be considered for high-level nuclear waste, and as I have indicated previously that three sites would be chosen and the President of the United States would then make a final determination. 
None of that was to be. Shortly after the legislation was enacted, in the following year during the Presidential campaign one region of the country was assured it would not be considered for high-level nuclear waste. An internal memorandum within the Department of Energy indicated that another region would be excluded because of political opposition, and then the ultimate indignity came in 1987 with a piece of legislation that Nevadans will forever regard as the `screw Nevada' bill which completely altered the thrust of the process and said, look, we will choose one State, one site, and that will be the place that we will concentrate our efforts. 
That site was at Yucca Mountain. The utilities are now contending that because no site would be available in 1998 to accept all of the high-level nuclear waste, indeed, a crisis atmosphere exists, that there is a call for action and they have proposed an ill-conceived piece of legislation that is S. 104 in our Chamber and H.R. 1270 in the other Chamber. 
Let me emphasize that this is not a proposal favored by the scientific community through the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a board established by act of Congress; it is not 
supported by the Department of Energy. It is the brainchild of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the overarching trade association that purports to advance the interests of nuclear utilities in America. 
There is no science involved in this legislation. The utilities argue speciously that because the nuclear waste will not be available for shipment to a repository, indeed, there will be an enormous cost incurred by the Federal Government, that damage claims will approximate as much as $80 billion. This is totally specious, a fictitious number that is spun out of whole cloth. But the solution that has been advanced is much more disturbing and that is S. 104-H.R. 1270. This is a piece of legislation that would emasculate most of the environmental laws that have enjoyed bipartisan support for a quarter of a century, all in the interest of advancing the nuclear utilities' argument. It would create a temporary nuclear waste dump at the Nevada test site, a separate geographical location from Yucca Mountain which is where the permanent storage facility is currently being characterized. 
Now, make no mistake that if H.R. 1270 and S. 104 were enacted tomorrow, under no conceivable scenario could any shipments occur in this year or, indeed, for some years into the future. 
This interim storage proposal is not only a direct threat to the environmental legislation in this country. It would establish a health and safety standard for us in Nevada with respect to the level of radioactive emissions measured in millirems that would be 25 times the level allowed for safe drinking water. That standard is 4 millirems. By statute this legislation would propose that the acceptable standard for Nevadans, where this waste would be shipped, would be 25 times that level or 100 millirems. No conceivable argument in terms of sound public policy or science would justify such a legislative mandate. 
For those who feel, as I do, that progress is being made in balancing the budget, with the possibility of a budget surplus for the first time in nearly three decades, the utilities have crafted a very clever bailout provision. Under the terms of the 1982 act, for each kilowatt of nuclear power generated, there is a mill tax levied. That mill tax goes into a nuclear waste fund, and out of that fund would be the expenses of maintaining a high-level nuclear waste repository, an obligation which would go far beyond the current life expectancy of any currently operating utilities. 
Actuarial experts tell us that even under current law that fund is underfunded. That is to say that eventually the taxpayers are going to have to bail that fund out. At no time did the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund financial formula contemplate that it would also pay for a so-called temporary dump, the one that is contemplated in S. 104 and H.R. 1270, so an additional financial burden would be added. 
The utilities are not content, however, with destroying that part of the financial basis for the legislation. They would impose a cap or a limitation on the amount of money that could be paid into that fund that would approximate the amount of money spent the previous year from the nuclear waste fund for purposes of this act. Remember that currently that fund, the nuclear waste fund, is underfunded actuarially. They would further limit the amount that goes into the fund, an amount which is going to be necessary for decades ahead, well beyond the life of any nuclear utility. So, by adding the expense of a temporary waste dump, putting a cap on the amount of the fees that are paid into that fund, they guarantee that the American taxpayers will have to come up with tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars from general taxpayer revenue in the outyears. That is simply financially irresponsible. Whatever one thinks of nuclear waste policy, we all ought to be able to agree that we ought not to build into legislation a financial time bomb which would begin ticking upon the enactment of this piece of legislation. This is a utility bailout provision and is bad policy. 
The nuclear utilities have litigated this issue. In November 1987 they argue that the Department of Energy must, under the 1982 act, accept immediately delivery of the high-level nuclear waste. That was rejected by the Court. As I have indicated, the Court in deciding the case indicates that there is an appropriate remedy. I think all of us would fairly recognize that the utilities will incur some additional expense as a result of any additional storage capacity that they need to construct on site. So it is conceded by all that the utilities would be entitled to an offset; that is, a reduction in the amount of the mill tax levy paid into the nuclear waste trust fund. Indeed, Secretary PenAE6a has initiated discussion along those lines. But the utilities have rejected that. They have rejected that because that's not what they want. They don't want fairness or an offset. What they want is a bailout, the provisions contained in this legislation, which shift the burden from the utilities to the American taxpayers in staggering amounts in the outyears. 
As I have indicated, the Department of Energy does not favor this legislation to establish a temporary waste dump at the Nevada test site. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board created by this Congress, comprised of scientists--parenthetically, none of them from my home State--reject the necessity for this action. We would, in effect, be transporting 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste to Nevada. That doesn't just get there miraculously. It would pass through 43 States. Fifty million people live within a mile or less of the highway and rail shipment corridors--some of the largest cities in America. Accidents do happen. The potential could be catastrophic. We cannot be unmindful of the fact that in America today we face the threat of terrorist activity. Such was the tragedy of the World Trade Center in New York City, and we have seen other evidences of terrorist activity in our country. What an inviting target, 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste being transported across the highways and rail corridors of America. 
Finally, the kind of storage that is contemplated at the Nevada test site in this so-called `temporary' facility is known as dry cask storage. That storage is currently available and in use in a number of the utilities in America today, on site, approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a storage life of 100 years. So, if it is safe for Nevada, why would it not be safe to leave it at its current location--that technology has been approved--and to leave it there until such time as the ultimate issue is resolved of how to deal with this most dangerous and toxic substance known to mankind? 
For those who have followed this debate for a number of years, it will come as no surprise that the utilities again have raised this crisis potential or scenario. Two decades ago, before this Senator came to the Chamber, the nuclear power industry was seeking, once again, to try to get the Congress to enact legislation to remove the high-level waste from the reactor sites. That program was then known as the AFR program, away-from-reactor site. If one looks at the arguments in the 1980s in which it was forecast that there would be a brownout, there would be a shortage of electricity in America, that all kinds of catastrophic things would happen to our economy--that was predicted by the mid-1980s if this legislation that was being proposed in the early eighties was not enacted. None of that far-fetched scenario came to be fact. In fact, no utility has suffered a brownout or a failure because of the absence of storage capacity. Many reactors have gone off line because they are no longer safe and others because they are not economically viable. That continues to be the case as recently as earlier this month with the reactor that is intended to be closed within the State of Illinois. 
So, there is storage capacity available on site through dry cask storage that avoids the necessity of moving 77,000 metric tons across the highways and rail systems of America, through 43 States, with all of the potential for risk and accident that is inherent in that kind of volume. There is no need to take action. That is the view of the scientific community. That is the view of the Department of Energy. And that is the view of the President, who has indicated, should this legislation reach his desk, he will veto it because it makes no sense in terms of policy. 
This is all about nuclear politics, not about nuclear energy policy. I urge my colleagues to be very careful when they listen to some of the advertisements that are currently airing on the radio and in the newspaper. The reality is that there is no crisis. We have been to this play before; same arguments, same results. Not necessary. Bad policy. And we should reject S. 104, H.R. 1270. 
I again express my appreciation to the distinguished senior Senator from Georgia for his courtesy and yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, Senators Enzi, Reid and I are today introducing legislation to stop the Interior Department from moving forward with regulations that in my view trample on States rights and invade the province of Governors and State legislators to determine what kinds of gaming activities will occur in their States. This proposed regulation flies in the face of the intent of Congress. 
I must say I am disappointed we are forced to take this step and would hope that the Secretary of the Interior would reconsider his ill-advised action. Last week the Secretary of Interior proposed rules that would allow the Interior Department to be the sole arbiter in the compacting process as to what kinds of gaming activities can be conducted on Native American lands. This is being done over the strong objections of the Nation's Governors and the Nation's Attorneys General, as well as the intent of Congress. 
I believe that in so doing, the Secretary is overstepping his authority and is making a grave mistake. In what I consider particularly convoluted logic, the Department has asserted that because the courts have struck down certain provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, referred to as IGRA, that they can step in and decide on their own what gaming activities States must allow tribes to engage in. 
I think by way of background, Mr. President, it may be helpful to share with my colleagues the basis of the underlying legislation as it relates to Native American gaming activities. In 1988, the Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and in so doing, tribal gaming activities were and are divided into three categories, with class I being reserved as traditional Indian games, class II being bingo-type games, and class III being casino-type games. Now, with respect to class III gaming, under the law, States and tribal governments negotiate a compact as to what type of games are to be permitted, if any, within class III. 
Under recent court decisions, Governors are required to negotiate with tribes only on gaming activity that is permitted by law in that State. For instance, Hawaii and Utah prohibit all forms of gaming, and therefore their respective Governors are not required to negotiate with tribes for any types of gaming activity. In Nevada, where we permit all forms of casino gaming, that is class III gaming, the State is required to enter into a compact with tribes allowing them to engage in all forms of gaming, and indeed without conflict or controversy five such compacts have been entered into. 
The Secretary has chosen, however, to put his own legal interpretation of what types of gaming activities must be put on the negotiating table. This so-called `scope of gaming' issue was fought out in the courts and decided in favor of Governors in the Rumsey case. The Rumsey case held that Governors are not forced to negotiate other gaming activities that are not permitted in the State in general. 
The Secretary appears to be trying to circumvent this decision and would force States, for example, that would allow a lottery and require them to negotiate with Indian tribes to make slot machines available, even though slot machines are illegal in that State. Given this clearly skewed legal interpretation, it seems to me that the Governors' fears are well-founded. 
The Department holds the position of fiduciary and trust obligation to the tribes and is an acknowledged advocate for tribal interests. The Department is taking the position that it should be the sole arbiter between the interest of the State and tribes in negotiating what form and scope of gaming should be permitted when it clearly has a bias in favor of one of the parties. 
It is no wonder the Governors said in their December 5 letter to President Clinton that they will actively oppose any independent assertion by the Secretary of his power to authorize tribal governments to operate class III gaming.

Mr. BRYAN. The Governors have repeatedly called the Secretary's proposal an inappropriate expansion of his authorities. Governors of the State in the process of negotiating a gaming compact with tribes will be severely disadvantaged by this proposal. Tribes will be much better off letting the Secretary of the Interior decide their fate--believing they can get a better deal from a person who is an acknowledged advocate for their interests and indeed encourages gaming as a means of generating tribal revenues. 
The Department asserts the States must be acting in bad faith for the Secretary to strip the States of their rights. Of course, the Secretary is the judge and jury over whether the States, in fact, are negotiating in bad faith. To make matters even worse and to heighten the concerns the Governors have, the Department has informed us that they would consider the actions of Governor Wilson of California to be negotiating in bad faith because he refuses to negotiate with any tribe that persists in operating illegal games on tribal reservations. As Governor Wilson has indicated, he has a simple rule: If it is legal under State law, all can do it; if it is not legal under State law, no one can do it. The Governor wants the tribes to cease and desist illegal gaming activities before he will negotiate a compact or legal game, and the Interior Department would consider that bad faith. 
Now, that situation is not peculiar to California alone. Let me cite an example, if I may, Mr. President, in a letter addressed to the Honorable Bruce Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, July 1, 1996, on behalf of the National Governors' Association. I quote a single paragraph from that letter. It arises out of the situation that occurred in the State of Florida. 
The factual situation underlying the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Seminole is an example of typical tribal-State conflict over IGRA implementation. Florida refused to negotiate with the Seminole Tribe over the operation of slot machines. Slot machines are prohibited by Florida law, and state voters have rejected three referenda to legalize such devices, as well as other casino-style games. The state's public policy and the preference of Florida citizens with respect to this type of gambling activity could not be clearer. Yet the Seminole Tribe proceeded to take the state to court on the grounds that Florida had failed to negotiate in good faith, even though the state was merely negotiating within the limits of state law and state public policy on gambling. 
Again, under the proposed regulation, the Interior Department would interpret the Florida situation as being one of bad faith and therefore the Interior Department could step in--in effect, supersede the negotiations and the position taken by Florida's Governor in response to voter preference and public policy in the State of Florida--and to negotiate a compact that could conceivably allow a full range of casino gaming activity contrary to the public policy of that State. 
Mr. President, I am personally offended that the Department has chosen to proceed with rulemaking in clear violation of the intent of Congress. Members will recall that Senator Enzi and I attached language to the Interior appropriations bill which imposes a moratorium on the Department implementing such a rule. The language reads: `During fiscal year 1998, the Secretary may not expend any funds made available under this act to review or approve any initial tribal-State compact for class III gaming entered into on or after the day of the enactment of this act, except for a compact which has been approved in accordance with IGRA and State law.' That contemplates the negotiating process between Governors and the tribal governments, as I indicated previously. 
Nevertheless, the Department has chosen to ignore our intent and to proceed with putting this process in place, which Congress has clearly said it doesn't want. Since the Department has chosen to ignore the clear intent of Congress, we are forced to stop this power grab once again through the legislative process. 
I might note over 100 compacts between States and tribes for class III gaming have been successfully negotiated. As I pointed out previously, five of those compacts are in place in Nevada. In only a handful of States has the compacting process failed. I believe the failure can be attributed to the unwillingness of Federal prosecutors to close down illegal tribal gaming operations. Tribes running illegal operations have no incentive to reach an agreement with States as long as they face no consequences for their illegal gaming activities. 
In California alone, tribes are operating 14,000 illegal slot machines. It is not clear to me why the Secretary of Interior feels the need to stack the deck even further against the interests of those States who do not favor, as a matter of public policy, slot machines in their States. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that the Secretary will reconsider this ill-advised proposal. If not, we will work with the Nation's Governors and Nation's attorneys general on this legislation to block the emasculation of States' rights. 
This bill is introduced by myself, Senator Enzi, and Senator Reid.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, yesterday, in perhaps the most antienvironmental vote of the Congress, the House of Representatives passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. Like the Senate bill that passed earlier this year, the House bill unfairly targets Nevada, a State with no nuclear reactors, as the final destination for 80,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste produced by the U.S. commercial nuclear utilities, most of which are located in the East. 
The central feature of the bill passed by the House yesterday, like the Senate bill, is the establishment of so-called interim storage of high-level commercial nuclear waste at the Nevada test site, about 80 miles north of the metropolitan Las Vegas area, an area that comprises some 1 million citizens. 
Like its Senate counterpart, the House bill tramples on decades of environmental policy, ignores public health and safety and exposes the American taxpayer to billions of dollars in cost to solve the private industry's waste problem. 
Fortunately, the President has indicated that he will veto either version of this misguided legislation. We have secured the votes in the Senate to sustain President Clinton's veto. 
While yesterday's House vote falls slightly short of the number required to sustain a veto in the House, we are still within striking distance of the required number, and I believe that in the end this bill has little or no chance of becoming law. 
As I have discussed many times here on the Senate floor, the nuclear power industry's legislation is nothing but corporate pork, plain and simple. It is a bailout for a dying industry at the expense of both the pocketbooks and the health and safety of the American public. 
Nevada, as the industry's chosen destination for its waste, has obvious objections to this legislation. But, Mr. President, other regions are also rightfully concerned with the potential impact on their citizens. Under this legislation, in just a few short years, 16,000 shipments of toxic, high-level nuclear waste will be transported by rail and highway through 43 States. More than 50 million Americans live within 1 mile of the proposed rail and truck routes. 
The bill requires the transportation of waste through many of our largest metropolitan centers and provides no assurance that funds will be available to provide training and equipment for emergency responders. 
Moreover, the bill makes a mockery of our Nation's environmental protection laws. It ignores the National Environmental Protection Act and would take precedence over nearly every local, State or Federal environmental statute or ordnance, including, among others, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and many more. It establishes radiation protection standards far lower than in any other Federal program and in complete contradiction to internationally accepted thresholds. 
The bill provides little or no public input or comment by affected communities or individuals and establishes a whole new set of unreachable deadlines, repeating the very mistakes Congress made in 1982 with the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act. 
All of this--the trampling of our environmental laws, the billions of dollars in subsidy to the nuclear power industry, and the grave threat to the health and safety of millions of Americans--is completely unnecessary. Nuclear utilities can and do store waste safely on site at reactors. In fact, the very same storage technology that the legislation contemplates using at the Nevada test site is currently used at reactor sites around the country, with many more sites soon to follow. No reactor in the United States has ever closed for lack of storage. 
Despite the scare tactics of the nuclear power industry, there is no storage crisis. Objective scientific experts agree that there is no storage crisis. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, an independent oversight board created by the Congress, found in March of 1996, and repeated again this year, that there is no compelling technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized interim facility for the next few years. Nevertheless, the nuclear power industry has been relentless in its efforts to move its waste to Nevada as soon as humanly possible, no matter what the consequences. 
Mr. President, we will continue to do whatever we can to stop this legislation from passing. With a firm veto threat in place and without the votes to override the veto, I encourage the leadership of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to stop this exercise in futility. Stop wasting Congress' time on ill-founded legislation that stands little or no chance of being enacted. 
The American people deserve more from us than wasting our time on billion-dollar subsidies for an industry that has spent too long already at the public trough. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
There are a number of riders attached to this conference report which should be cause for concern by my colleagues. I am most troubled by the conferees' treatment of the Forest Service purchaser road credit program. 
During this body's consideration of the Interior appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to eliminate this environmentally destructive subsidy. It failed by a single vote. A similar amendment in the House also failed by a single vote. 
The purchaser road credit program allows the Forest Service to subsidize the road construction costs of timber companies by granting credits to them equal to the estimated cost of the roads they need to access their timber. Timber purchasers can then use the credit to pay for the timber being harvested. Last year these `purchaser credits' were valued at nearly $50 million. 
In the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill, a limit of $25 million was placed on the value of purchaser credits that may be offered by the Forest Service in fiscal year 1998. The conference report before us today eliminates this cap entirely. The Senate report accompanying the bill `directs the Forest Service to continue the timber purchaser credit program without change' and makes it clear that `the committee has not specified the ceiling for the amount of purchaser credits that can be offered' to timber companies. The result of this language is an open-ended subsidy for the timber industry. 
Mr. President, in spite of the conferees' decision to expand this subsidy, I intend to send a letter to the administration urging them to use their discretionary authority to abolish this wasteful and environmentally unsound program, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield 
the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation offered by my colleagues, Senator Feingold and Senator McCain. I am pleased to join with all 44 of my Democratic colleagues, as well as Senators McCain, Thompson, Collins, and Specter. I hope during the course of this debate others will join us in this first step in campaign finance reform that we so desperately need. 
Campaign finance reform is an issue that deserves our full consideration and one that must be voted on this year, whatever time it takes. Mr. President, I would like to, at the outset, commend Senators Feingold and McCain for their thoughtful and careful bipartisan approach in crafting a piece of campaign finance reform that, although I believe it to be modest--more modest than I would have preferred--nevertheless marks a beginning. 
The integrity of our political system is threatened by the tremendous amounts of money required to run for public office. The Members in this Chamber know it, political scholars know it, and the American people know it. 
Mr. President, I first sought elective public office in 1968 as a candidate for my State legislature. Then and now, some money was required in order to put together a campaign, to prepare the necessary kinds of materials, and to make sure the constituents that one sought to persuade knew what your message was. Over the intervening years, I have had occasion to run for State elective office on four different occasions and have had an opportunity to run for the U.S. Senate twice now. There is no question, from any perspective, any point of view, that the amount of money that is involved today in the American political system far exceeds, by any measure, any growth that may be attributed to inflation or any other reasonable consequence, including the growth of the population in my own State and generally across the country. 
There has been, during that intervening nearly 30 years since the time I have been involved in the elective political system, a marked decline in voter participation in this system. This is an alarming trend. It does not bode well for Democrats or Republicans or Independents, nor does it bode well for the future of democratic institutions. 
Mr. President, I believe that there is an absolute correlation between declining voter interest and the ever larger sums of money being raised to fuel the money chase. Nearly $2.7 billion was spent on campaigns in the last election cycle. Every year the expense of campaigning climbs higher and higher, and the pressure to seek financial support for those who seek public office intensifies accordingly. 
I know that some contend there is not enough money being spent in the American political system. I respectfully disagree with that opinion, and I believe that the great majority of the American public disagrees as well. 
A full 92 percent of Americans believe that too much money is spent on campaigns. The Wall Street Journal poll of December of last year reflects that number. Indeed, money has become a dominant factor in American politics as to who runs and who wins. As a consequence, our political system is on a downward spiral that will continue to spin out of control unless we have the courage to take the steps necessary to stop it. There is a sense of irony, Mr. President, that the institution that benefits the most from the current system is the only one that can reform it. But we must put the interest of country ahead of our own political success and ahead of party interests. 
The revised McCain-Feingold bill is, as I have said, a very modest proposal; nevertheless, it is a first step in reforming a campaign financing system that cries out for change. It just might begin to restore the people's trust in the ability of their elected officials to stop the hemorrhaging of the political system and to allow the healing process to begin. As I said, I would have preferred a more comprehensive approach, but that is not to be. However, this is an effort which may have a chance to attract more support and thus has a chance of becoming law. Senators Feingold and McCain have carefully reshaped their original bill as a compromise with the hope of attracting additional Republican votes, which will be needed for its passage. 
First, the McCain-Feingold legislation bans the use of so-called soft money by the national political parties from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals. State parties would be banned from spending soft money on activities related to Federal elections. 
The creative expanded uses by both political parties of soft money has significantly increased the demand for campaign contributions. This past 1996 election year was the costliest ever in our Nation's history. Both parties raised overall $881 million for the election--a 73 percent increase over the amount of the preceding 4 years when the parties raised $508 million. In soft money alone, Democrat and Republican parties raised $263.5 million. That is nearly three times the amount that was raised in the preceding 4-year cycle. From 1988 to 1996, the amount of soft money raised by the parties has 
increased by nearly 600 percent. 
What needs to be done? The American people have been asked what they think needs to be done to reform the political process in this country. From the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey of June 1997 when that question was propounded, the American public is not confused. Perhaps some Members of Congress are confused, but the American public is not confused.  
Reduce the amount that candidates can accept from political action committees, impose overall spending limits on campaigns, eliminate large contributions to political parties, and provide some financial incentives to candidates. 
Sixty-two percent of the American people believe that is what ought to be done. 
Among the other options that were discussed were: 
Remove all limits on contributions so people can give as much money as they want, but require more timely disclosure of these donations. 
Some of our colleagues believe that we ought to be spending more money in running for public office. The American public disagrees overwhelmingly. Only 18 percent favor the removal of limits on contributions. 
Leave the current campaign financing system intact. 
Only 14 percent favor that course of action. 
Now, I understand that the debate and the argument is that campaign spending is a form of free speech and therefore cannot be regulated in any form. The American people, when asked that question, conclude that--18 percent of them--as a form of free speech, that cannot be regulated; and 74 percent believe campaign spending has nothing to do with free speech and that spending limits should be imposed. That data is also from the previously cited 1997 NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey. 
Mr. President, I understand, having had occasion to practice law and having served as the attorney general of my State, that the constitutionality of an issue cannot be determined simply by a majority of public opinion at any one time. I certainly do not argue that to be the case because constitutional principles rise to a higher level than what a majority at any given point in time might favor. Nevertheless, during the course of debate on this and other legislation, critics of proposed legislation frequently invoke the contention that the legislation as drafted is unconstitutional. That debate has occurred in the context of this bill. The able and distinguished Senator from Kentucky has cited a number of constitutional scholars who weighed in in favor of the proposition that this legislation, in its attempt to limit soft money and other restrictions, is unconstitutional. On the other side of the constitutional divide, an equal body of distinguished scholars have weighed in on behalf of the proposition advocated by Senators Feingold and McCain and have asserted that these provisions are indeed constitutional. 
My point in mentioning this is that we in this Chamber are not going to be able to decide that issue. We will not be able to resolve it. That is not our function. The function of the legislative branch of the two Houses of Congress is to enact legislation and, indeed, if the legislation that we have enacted is in any way constitutionally flawed, the courts--ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States--will make that decision, and the courts have done so when they believe that we have overstepped the constitutional limits in imposing restrictions on our campaign financing system. 
Mr. President, we ought to allow the courts to make that determination and to move this legislation forward so that those who seek to challenge it have an opportunity to do so in the only meaningful forum in which this issue can be resolved on a constitutional basis, and that is in the judicial arena. 
Mr. President, unless we have the good sense to change the rules of the game, candidates and their political parties will continue to pursue the money chase and the amount of money involved in future campaigns will continue to grow rapidly. I frequently tell the constituents in my own State that this fatally flawed campaign system that is involved has locked good people into a bad system in which, almost from the moment of our election, it is impressed upon us that the next campaign, if we choose to run for reelection, will be more costly than the previous one, and our focus almost immediately is upon how much money will I have to raise each week that I serve, each month that I serve, if I choose to seek reelection. 
The amount of money has increased, as I have indicated, not just arithmetically based upon factors of inflation and the growth that is occurring in the populations of our respective States, but they have grown exponentially, and it might constitute the gravest threat to the integrity of the political system in America. 
This bill proposed by Senators McCain and Feingold would do several things. In addition to the ban on soft money, the bill places a restriction on issue ads by independent special interests. If a Federal candidate's name is mentioned in any broadcast television or radio communication within 60 days of an election, for example, then this candidate-related expenditure will be subject to Federal election law and must be disclosed 
and financed with so-called hard dollars. 
The Supreme Court has ruled that only communications that contain express advocacy of candidates are subject to Federal disclosure requirements and restrictions. This proposal would extend to include issue ads running 60 days prior to the election in which the individual candidate's name is mentioned in those ads. 
Third, the legislation increases disclosure requirements and requires the Federal Election Commission to make campaign finance records available on the Internet within 24 hours of their filing. It requires political ads to carry a disclaimer identifying who is responsible for the content of the ad. Simply put, disclosure requirements would bring more accountability and responsibility to our political process. 
Fourth, the bill prohibits political parties from making coordinated expenditures on behalf of Senate candidates who do not agree to limit their personal spending to $50,000 per election. This provision, in my opinion, will help to level the playing field between wealthy candidates and those candidates who do not have deep financial pockets. 
Fifth, this bipartisan legislation prohibits anyone who is not a U.S. citizen from making financial contributions. 
Finally, and what has become a central focus of this issue in recent days, McCain-Feingold requires that labor unions notify nonunion members that they are entitled to have their agency fees reduced by an amount equal to the portion of the fees used for political purposes if they file an objection to the use of those fees--a so called opt-out system in which the member can notify the union that he or she does not want any union dues used to finance any part of the political campaign contribution system. Fair enough, it seems. 
The Supreme Court's 1988 Beck decision explicitly states that nonunion members in union shops may choose to pay reduced agency fees, and the McCain-Feingold bill simply codifies the Beck decision.

Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, we hear that opponents of McCain-Feingold have argued for the need to codify the Beck decision. Senators Feingold and McCain have done just that by including a provision that expressly codifies the Supreme Court decision. 
Now, however, there is an effort to seek a new amendment, a new provision. The pending amendment is clever. It indeed may rise to the level of being ingenious. But its sole purpose and function is to kill the cause of campaign finance reform. The majority leader himself was quoted in the Wall Street Journal in September this past month as saying: 
I set it up [referring to the amendment] so they will be filibustering me. 
This is a political tactic that is designed to thwart, to prevent campaign finance reform. 
It clearly indicates that this is not a serious debate about reforming our campaign laws. 
Perhaps the Washington Post editorial of October 1, 1997, sets the record in the proper context. And I quote: 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, having magnanimously allowed campaign finance reform legislation to come to the floor, now proposes to kill it with an amendment affecting the use of labor union dues for political purposes. 
I regret that the amendment in that form was offered. I hope that some mechanism might be developed to permit us to pursue campaign finance reform and offer other amendments without this particular provision which has been variously characterized as a `killer' amendment or a `poison pill' amendment because I believe that its purpose is to effectively prevent campaign finance reform. 
Mark Twain once observed that `Everyone complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it.' The same could be said about the way we finance our campaigns for elective office. 
If there ever was a time to reform our political system, the time is now. Neither political party has benefited in terms of public opinion from our present campaign finance system. Overwhelmingly, 92 percent of the American people believe that our system desperately needs reform and the time for us to do it is now. If we let this opportunity slip away, I fear that real campaign finance reform may not be enacted. 
We need to ban soft money, and to stop the onslaught of negative ad attacks on political candidates. 
We need to level the playing field, and give challengers who want to run for Congress and to prove that their ideas have merit and represent a broad base of public support the opportunity to do so. 
Madam President, we need to restore public confidence in the American political system. And I believe that the McCain-Feingold revised measure represents our best hope for making these significant and needed changes prior to the next election. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, earlier today the Labor Subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee held a hearing on a report prepared by the National Cancer Institute regarding the health effects of fallout from atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons in the 1950's and 1960's. 
Today, 35 years after the last atmospheric test, we are just beginning to get a clear picture of the effects of the radioactive fallout from these tests. 
While we should obviously continue to do everything we can to help the victims of these tests, I hope we can also learn something from our mistakes in the past. 
This August, the National Cancer Institute released the results of its nationwide study of radioactive fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950's and 1960's. 
In 1982, Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop methods to estimate radioactive iodine-131 exposure, to assess thyroid I-131 doses, and to assess risks for thyroid cancer from the exposures. 
Ninety atmospheric tests were conducted at the test site mainly in the years 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1957. 
All 48 contiguous States received some degree of exposure to radioactive iodine-131 fallout from these atmospheric nuclear bomb tests. 
Everyone in those States was exposed. 
Let me repeat that--everyone was exposed. 
People living hundreds of miles to the north and east of the Nevada Test Site in Montana, Idaho, Utah, South Dakota, and Colorado were exposed. 
Within these 5 States, 25 counties had particularly high fall-out exposure ranging from 12.0 to 9.0 rads. 
A `rad' is a radiation absorbed dose, which is the amount of radiation absorbed by the tissues in the body. 
The tragic conclusion of this study is that children, who lived in these high exposure areas, and who were aged between 3 months and 5 years at the time of the tests were at the greatest risk for iodine-131 exposure. 
Since children's thyroids are so small, their exposure was disproportionately higher than adults. 
Children who drank contaminated milk--particularly from cows maintained for family use--and which ate pasture vegetation, have an even greater exposure. 
The children in this age group exceeded the average per capita thyroid dose by a factor of about 3.7 following the tests because of their greater milk consumption and their smaller thyroids. 
After each of the 90 tests, people living in these States were exposed to varying levels of iodine-131--for about 2 months following each test. 
This means the air, milk, and other dairy products, eggs and leafy vegetables were all contaminated, and that contamination lingered for a significant period of time after each test. 
The National Cancer Institute has concluded from the limited data available on people who were exposed, as children, to iodine-131 from the nuclear tests' fallout that this exposure is linked to thyroid cancer. 
NCI estimates between 10,000 to 75,000 people who were exposed as children may develop fallout-associated thyroid cancer during their lifetime. 
Nearly all were under 15 years of age at the time of exposure, and 75 percent were under 5 years of age. 
NCI is currently working with scientists in Belarus and Ukraine to study thyroid cancer following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. 
Thousands of children exposed to the accident's fallout received radiation doses to their thyroids. 
These doses ranged from comparatively small to 10 times higher than U.S. residents received from the Nevada tests in the 1950's and 1960's. 
There was a clear increase in thyroid cancer from the Chernobyl accident in this population. 
The wide range of radioactive fallout exposures to such a large number of people that resulted in an increase in thyroid cancer will be most helpful in assessing the impact of the Nevada tests on those exposed. 
Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers are studying the health effects of radioactive iodine released from the Hanford, WA nuclear weapons plant in the 1940's and 1950's. 
The Hanford study results are to be available in 1998. 
The Institute of Medicine [IOM] is currently also working with the Department of Health and Human Services to review the data from the National Cancer Institute's study to assess the risk to the exposed individuals. 
The IOM will also develop recommendations for physicians regarding how to treat people who might be at risk of disease because of their I-131 exposure. 
These recommendations should be available within 6 to 9 months. 
What child growing up in the 1950's and early 1960's was not encouraged to drink as much milk as possible to build strong and healthy bodies? In the 1950's and 1960's, health experts advocated each youngster should consume four glasses of milk each day. No one in those years expected young children living hundreds of miles to the north and east of the Nevada Test Site drinking their milk were going to face a possible increase in thyroid cancer incidence. 
But that is the consequence being faced by those exposed. 
In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that some of the scientists and engineers associated with atmospheric testing knew, or at least suspected, that there were health and safety consequences to the fallout. 
Some of the Government personnel working on the testing program actually sent their families away from the area during and immediately after tests to protect them from the fallout. 
A story reported yesterday in the New York Times is even worse, the Atomic Energy Commission apparently warned the Eastman Kodak Co. and other film companies of planned tests, so that the film companies could take steps to protect their film stocks from being damaged. 
Somehow, the AEC decided it was more important to protect photographic film, than the health and safety of tens of thousands of citizens who were exposed and who, today, we know will suffer thyroid and other genetic problems as a consequence of that exposure. 
The last atmospheric test took place 35 years ago, but signs of atmospheric testing are still present in many areas, including southern Nevada. 
Recently, in fact, scientists discovered the presence of radioactive contamination in dust in some attics in Las Vegas. 
Nevadans have had plenty of experience with the Department of Energy. 
During the cold war, we were proud to do our patriotic duty, and host the Nevada Test Site, the United States' major continental nuclear weapons testing facility. 
We were all very proud of our participation in what we expected to be an exciting new age, we thought we were at the center of a new technology that would dominate the 21st century. 
Of course, as these recent studies have shown pretty clearly, we were all completely ignorant of the tremendous dangers and costs of the nuclear age, and most of the captivating ideas of the 1950's never developed. In point of fact, nuclear power is on the decline. 
Nuclear plants close regularly, due either to serious safety related problems, or dismal economic performance. 
The legacy of the nuclear age, however, is still with us, the tens of thousands metric tons of commercial high-level nuclear waste, and an incomprehensible volume of defense related waste generated by the production of nuclear weapons. 
Over Nevada's vigorous objections, our State has been targeted as the final resting place for these dangerous, poisonous wastes. 
The Department of Energy, and the nuclear power industry, have spent millions of dollars attempting to convince Nevadans that they have nothing to fear, that this waste is perfectly safe, and poses no threat to our health and safety. 
Unfortunately, Nevadans have had enough experience with the Department of Energy and its scientists to hold a certain amount of skepticism regarding these claims. 
The report being reviewed by the committee today is yet another confirmation that the Department has historically cultivated a culture where concerns for public health and safety are subsumed to the pressure to reach the agencies ultimate goals, whether it is the development of nuclear weapons, or the disposal of commercial high-level nuclear waste. 
The Yucca Mountain project is no exception. 
In the 15 years Nevada has fought being designated as the repository for commercial high-level nuclear waste, we have seen repeated instances of the Department ignoring or explaining away scientific findings that do not conform to its repository program. 
Signs of water percolating through the repository site were repeatedly ignored. 
Seismic activity in the area, including an earthquake that did serious damage to the buildings housing project offices, were dismissed. 
For every objection that has been raised, the Department has been quick to assure us that they are meaningless, and that even if there were problems, the engineers can design around them. 
Recently, several new discoveries have added to the uncertainty about the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a repository site, and called into question the models and assumptions Yucca Mountain scientists have relied upon for more than a decade. 
For example, analysis of material removed from the exploratory tunnel at Yucca Mountain have shown pockets of unusually high concentrations of chlorine 136, a radioactive isotope generated by nuclear detonations. 
The presence of high levels of chlorine 136 at the proposed repository level is assumed to result from penetration of water from the surface, where it picked up chlorine 136 fallout from atmospheric testing at the NTS 50 years ago. 
This rapid penetration of water through the welded tuff of Yucca Mountain contradicts the Department of Energy's assumptions about the nature of the geology at the site, and calls into question the validity and accuracy of much of the characterization effort. 
Despite repeated assurances by the Department of Energy and the nuclear power industry that the nature and behavior of radioactivity and radionuclides are well understood and predictable, and thus nothing for Nevadans to worry about, evidence continues to mount that the scientific community actually knows little about this field. 
Just 1 month ago, scientists studying the Nevada Test Site, an area adjacent to Yucca Mountain, discovered that plutonium resulting from underground nuclear testing have migrated underground far faster and further than previously expected--nearly a mile in less than 30 years. 
The empirical data collected at the site contradicts the models that are being relied on by the Department to evaluate the environmental impacts of underground testing at the Nevada Test Site. 
The cumulative effect of these, and other, scientific assurances that later prove to be inaccurate, misleading, or even outright dishonest has been to seriously damage the credibility of the Department of Energy and the nuclear industry in Nevada, and elsewhere across the Nation. 
Nevadans, and many others, will continue to suffer the consequences of our failure to properly understand the nature and effects of radioactivity in the past. 
Despite these historical lessons, however, the proponents of nuclear energy continue to press forward with their misguided efforts to bolster the industry at the expense of the health and safety of the public. 
The most recent incarnation of the industry's avarice is the nuclear waste legislation currently working its way through this Congress. In a misguided attempt to remove waste from reactor sites, where it can be, according to the industry itself, safely stored for the next 100 years, the industry has proposed shipping 80,000 metric tons of its waste on 16,000 shipments through 43 States to Nevada where it will be stored in exactly the same type of storage currently available and, in some instances, currently in use at existing reactor sites. This unprecedented shipping campaign will bring shipments of high-level nuclear waste within 1 mile of the homes of more than 50 million Americans, creating potential public health and environmental consequences of staggering proportions. 
The nuclear power industry's attempt to ship its waste to above-ground storage in Nevada is corporate welfare at its worst. In a desperate attempt to rejuvenate a dying industry, the nuclear power industry is willing to sacrifice the health and safety of millions of Americans to improve its bottom line. 
Mr. President, there is simply no need to move this dangerous, poisonous waste at this time. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the industry itself concedes the storage of the waste at reactor sites is safe. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, an independent oversight board created by Congress, has said that centralized interim storage is presently not needed. 
The nuclear power industry's waste legislation has passed the Senate and I fear will likely pass the House in the near future. Fortunately, President Clinton has committed to veto this ill-advised piece of legislation, and we are fortunate to have the votes in the Senate to sustain the veto. 
It is time for the nuclear utilities to give up their efforts to establish interim storage in Nevada and enter into serious negotiations with the Department of Energy regarding support for the continued storage of high-level nuclear waste at reactor sites until an objective, defensible characterization of Yucca Mountain can be completed. 
In the 1950's and 1960's, most public policymakers could not understand the terrible consequences that would result from atmospheric testing. Today, more than 40 years later, every taxpayer is contributing to compensate those downwind victims for the cancer, genetic, and other health effects from the fallout of those tests. It would be inexcusable for us, with what we know today, to create yet another situation where future legislators, our successors, 50, 100, or even 150 years from now will need to make similar arrangements for new generations of victims of the legislation the nuclear power industry is asking us to approve in this Congress. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and if there is any time remaining, I yield back the remainder of the time.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I listened to the debate, discussion, the colloquy that has occurred between the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from Wyoming, who is the sponsor of this amendment. I read the amendment proposed by the Senator from Wyoming, and I believe that it does not in any way interfere with the operation of existing tribal-State compacts. It has no operative effect on those agreements, and I do not understand that the Senator from Wyoming intends to have any operating effects. 
Further, it is my understanding from reading the amendment that the Senator's intent is designed to prevent the Secretary of the Interior from unilaterally approving a compact and bypassing the State process that has been established. He attempts to accomplish this by imposing a 1-year moratorium. 
No. 1, it does not in any way have an operative effect on existing tribal-State compacts. 
No. 2, I think it is fair to say that the purpose of it is to prevent the Secretary of the Interior, in effect, from bypassing the process, the State compact negotiating process, to unilaterally approve such. 
I support what the Senator from Wyoming is trying to accomplish. 
I have had conversations with the Secretary of the Interior in the past, and I know he believes that he has the ability to do that unilaterally. 
Having said that, the point that is made by the Senator from Hawaii is absolutely accurate. That is, as this language is cast in its present form, it would preempt the State process by requiring both the Governor and the State legislature to concur with any compact that has been negotiated with the tribal government. The Senator from Hawaii is absolutely correct in the statement that he makes. 
I believe that the Senator from Wyoming, responding to that concern, has offered language that addresses that issue when he proposes to change or modify his amendment by striking line 7 and interlineating in its place instead `in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act and State law,' and at the bottom of page 2, striking all after the word `approved' on line 17 and inserting similar language. I believe that he accomplishes the objective that I support and responds to the very legitimate point that the Senator from Hawaii makes.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to explain the purpose of my amendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. When the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted in 1988, the year before I joined this body, a central concept was that class III gambling, such as casino and parimutuel gambling, could be conducted on Indian lands with a tribal-State compact approved by the Governors and tribes and then by the Secretary of the Interior. 
Today, there are hundreds of Indian gaming establishments across the Nation offering class III gambling. I might just add parenthetically that our experience in Nevada is that we currently have five such tribal agreements in which five tribes have entered into agreements with Nevada's Governor pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and those compacts have been approved. 
I want to make it very clear that I support the intent of the act, and I support the right of Indian tribal governments to enter into compacts with States and to pursue gaming activity at a class III level. 
Most of the tribal governments that have entered into these agreements are operating under the approval of these tribal-State compacts, as contemplated by the original law. However, almost from the beginning, there have been some tribes who have chosen to operate illegal class III gambling without an approved tribal-State compact. Over time, some of these gaming operations have become legal by negotiating compacts with the States in which they are located. Some gambling operators, including some who take in millions of dollars each year, have chosen to disregard, indeed, to flout the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by blatantly continuing to operate illegal class III games without an approved compact, as contemplated by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
Many of the Nation's Governors have appealed to Congress and to Justice to stop this; simply stated, to enforce the law. In the meantime, these tribes continue to operate illegal gambling, believing that the Justice Department would not move to shut them down. 
To date, they have largely been right. The Department of Justice and U.S. attorneys across the country have done an abysmal job of enforcing Indian gambling laws. During the year since enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, I have had several discussions with Justice about this problem, both the previous administration and the current administration. None of these conversations have been very satisfactory. 
It is time that illegal gambling is stopped. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is an important law, and it should be enforced. There is simply no excuse for Justice not to do that. There are widespread concerns about the lack of regulation in Indian-run gaming. Today, we should and must make it clear to Justice that this Congress expects its laws to be enforced. If Justice moved tomorrow to enforce the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, those who conduct legal Indian gaming under the provisions of the law would benefit. 
I hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this sense-of-the-Senate provision. It is very simple, very straightforward. It does nothing to impede legal Indian gambling. 
I repeat that I support legal Indian gambling. We have such in Nevada. By this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we are simply telling Justice that they should enforce existing Federal laws against illegal gambling. Simply: Do your job, enforce the law.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment offered by my good friend from Arkansas. I appreciate the deeply held commitment of my colleague to the issue of mining law reform. As I have told my colleague many times over the years, I agree with him that the 1872 mining law is in need of reform--our differences on this issue are one of degree. 
The Bumpers amendment simply goes too far. If enacted, this amendment would severely threaten the economic viability of the hardrock mining industry in my home state of Nevada and throughout the western United States. 
For the fifth year in a row, Nevada's mines have collectively topped the 6 million ounce mark in gold production. In 1996, there was a total of 7.08 million ounces of gold produced in Nevada. The state's rich landscape has made Nevada the largest gold producer in the nation with 66.5 percent of all production. In addition, it now accounts for 10 percent of all the gold in the world. 
The most recent information from the State of Nevada indicates that direct mining employment in Nevada exceeds 13,000 jobs. The average annual pay for these jobs, the highest of any sector in the state, is about $46,000, compared to the average salary in Nevada of about $26,000 per year. In addition to the direct employment in mining, there are an estimated 36,000 jobs in the state related to providing goods and services needed by the industry. 
The impression left by proponents of this amendment is that the mining industry has free reign to extract mineral resources from public land. Nothing is further from the truth. In my state, Nevada mining companies must pay taxes like any other business, and they also pay an additional Nevada tax called the `Net Proceeds of Mines Tax.' This tax must be paid by mining companies regardless of whether they operate on private or public land. The total Net Proceeds tax paid to the state in 1995 was approximately $33 million. With the addition of sales and property tax, the industry paid approximately $141 million in state and local taxes in 1995. In addition, the Nevada mining industry paid approximately $95 million in federal taxes in 1995. 
The additional taxes imposed by the Bumpers amendment would be extremely onerous for mining operators in Nevada. These new taxes would likely force many mining operations to shut down, thereby causing an overall reduction in federal and state tax revenues paid by the industry. The bottom line is that the mining industry pays taxes just like any other business, and in Nevada they pay an additional tax targeted specifically to their industry. 
The issue of reclamation is also central to the mining law reform debate. The State of Nevada has one of the toughest, if not the toughest, state reclamation programs in the country. Nevada mining companies are subject to a myriad of federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Endangered Species Act. Mining companies must secure literally dozens of environmental permits prior to commencing mining activities, including a reclamation permit, which must be obtained before a mineral exploration project or mining operation can be conducted. Companies must also file a surety or bond with the State or the federal land manager in an amount sufficient to ensure reclamation of the entire site prior to receiving a reclamation permit. 
It is in the context of promoting the economic viability of the mining industry and of encouraging strong environmental reclamation efforts administered by the states that I view the debate over the reform of the Mining Law of 1872. As I have stated many times over the years, I feel that certain aspects of the 1872 mining law are in need of reform. Specifically, I feel strongly that the patenting provision of the current law should be changed to provide for the payment of fair market value for the surface estate. All patents should also include a reverter clause, which would ensure that patented public lands would revert to federal ownership if no longer used for mining purposes. I believe that mining law reform legislation should ensure that any land used for mining purposes must be reclaimed pursuant to applicable federal and state statues. And finally, I believe that mining law reform legislation should impose a reasonable royalty on mineral production from Federal land. 
Mr. President, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997, of which I am a cosponsor, addresses each of the concerns I have just outlined. This legislation would impose a 5% net proceeds royalty on mineral production from Federal lands. It would make permanent the $100 maintenance fee for every claim held on federal land. It calls for the payment of fair market value for patented lands and includes a reverter provision to ensure that patented lands are used only for mining purposes. Finally, the legislation directs revenues from mineral production on Federal lands to a special fund to assist state abandoned mine clean-up programs. It is my hope that this legislation will serve as the starting point for the debate over mining law reform in the 105th Congress. 
I agree with the Senator from Arkansas that we have waited long enough for Congress to enact comprehensive mining law reform. The aura of uncertainty that the industry has been forced to operate under for the last decade is causing many companies to look overseas for their future operations. The number of U.S. and Canadian mining companies exploring or operating in Latin America continues to grow dramatically. I do not feel, however, that the legislation before us today provides the proper context to rewrite the general mining laws. 
I hope I will have the opportunity in the near future to work with the distinguished Senator from Arkansas and other interested Members of this body to craft a piece of legislation that we can move to the floor and enact in this session of Congress. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am always pleased, when I have the opportunity, as I do this afternoon, to support, and in this instance actually propose, legislation that benefits both the American taxpayer and the environment. 
The amendment I am offering today eliminates a subsidy used primarily by large timber companies that not only has negative consequences for the taxpayers but also a detrimental effect on the environment. 
Each year, American taxpayers spend millions of dollars to subsidize the construction of roads needed for logging on national forest lands. 
The appropriations bill before us today contains a $47.4 million appropriation for the Forest Service to assist in the construction and reconstruction of timber roads in our national forests. In addition, the bill, and accompanying report, provide affirmative direction to the Forest Service instructing them to continue the purchaser credit program without limitation. 
The purchaser credit program allows the Forest Service to subsidize the road construction costs of timber companies by granting credits to them equal to the estimated cost of the roads that they need in order to access their timber. The timber purchasers can then use the credits to pay for the timber being harvested. Last year these purchaser credits were valued at nearly $50 million. 
In the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill a limit of $25 billion was placed on the value of purchaser credits that may be offered by the Forest Service in fiscal year 1998. The bill before the Senate today eliminates this cap completely, and the report accompanying the bill makes it clear that `The committee has not specified a ceiling for the amount of purchaser credits which can be offered' to timber companies. The result of this language is an open-ended subsidy for the timber industry. 
My amendment stands for a very simple proposition. If a timber purchaser needs to build a road to harvest timber, the timber purchaser should have to pay for it. The amendment which I am offering eliminates the purchaser credit program and cuts $10 million from the Forest Service timber road construction and reconstruction account. 
In addition, my amendment provides that road construction costs incurred by timber purchasers are to be treated as timber revenues for the purpose of payment to States for use on roads and schools in the counties where national forests are located. The result of this latter provision is that counties will be held harmless as a result of the elimination of the purchaser credit program. 
For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with this program, let me give a brief description of how the purchaser credit program operates. When the Forest Service wants to use purchaser credits to build the road to a planned timber sale, and parenthetically that is about 90 percent of the time, it must estimate the cost to build the road, the value of the timber in the sale area, and the road right-of-way. Prospective purchasers go through a similar process of estimating their roadbuilding costs and their estimated value of the timber they must pay for to the Forest Service. 
Considering all of these factors, the prospective purchasers submit their bids accordingly. When a purchaser is awarded the contract for the timber sale the Forest Service establishes the dollar value of the purchaser road credit attached to that sale and credits the account in that amount to the timber contract holder as the road is constructed. The contractor, therefore, has immediate access to the credits to be used in place of cash deposits and the agency, the purchaser, is also given discretion to use the credit on any timber sale contract that it holds in the forest. The Forest Service allows the transfer of purchaser credits between timber sales located within the same national forest. 
Now the ability to transfer credits aids a purchaser's ability to manage its timber sale portfolio cash flow. Since road construction often delays timber harvest, purchasers who can rapidly transfer road credits to another sale from their portfolio can attain lower portfolio management costs. The result is analogous to an interest-free loan for timber purchasers. 
The opponents of this amendment contend eliminating the purchaser road credit will devastate the timber industry. Their claim could not be further from the truth. The Bureau of Land Management in several States is successful at selling timber and getting the necessary roads constructed without the use of the purchaser road credit that is exclusive to the Forest Service. The effects on the Forest Service timber sale program of eliminating the purchaser credit program and requiring that roads be constructed pursuant to specified standards as the BLM and the States require would be environmentally and economically beneficial. 
Eliminating road credits will force purchasers to internalize the cost of road construction into their bid price for the timber. The result is a more balanced system that provides equal treatment for all purchasers of publicly owned timber, BLM and Forest Service lands. Without the purchaser credit program it is likely that fewer roads would be built and less habitat would be fragmented. Purchasers are less likely to want to build extensive road networks if they have to pay cash for them. 
Consequently, timber sales with high road building costs will be less attractive to purchasers than timber sales with low or no road building costs. 
Another important aspect of eliminating the purchaser credit program is that it will shift responsibility for estimating road costs from the Forest Service to purchasers. If markets are competitive, such a shift should provide a more accurate and an efficient road cost accounting system. 
An independent study of timber sales in the Pacific Northwest found that the Forest Service estimates for road construction costs can be as much as 30 percent higher than actual costs for the industry to build those roads. A recent 
report from the General Accounting Office discovered that Forest Service estimates of road costs include a profit margin for purchasers. It also found that the Forest Service lacked accountability for the accuracy of their road cost estimates because purchasers are not required to report actual costs of construction and reconstruction. So if actual road costs are overestimated, the extra purchaser credits awarded and subsequently traded for timber represent a windfall profit for the purchaser, a profit that comes at the public's expense. This inefficient situation would be eliminated if purchaser credits were abolished. 
Contrary to what you will hear from my opponents of this proposal, my amendment will not end logging in the national forests. Requiring timber purchasers to pay for road construction costs will likely reduce timber sales in roadless areas where the environmental and economic costs of logging are the greatest. I believe this is sound public policy. Roadless areas are not good places to produce commercial timber because they tend to be a high elevation, steep, and inaccessible. The timber sales in these areas are the ones that cause by far the most environmental problems and the ones which are the biggest money losers because of the high cost of road building. 
Let me invite my colleagues' attention to an excellent article entitled `Quiet Roads Bring in Thundering Protests,' an article that ran earlier this year in the New York Times that illustrated the environmental damage caused by road construction. A biologist with the Idaho Fish and Game Department, Chip Corsi, notes in the article that researchers have found that as little as 1.7 miles of road per square mile forest have the effect of reducing the complement of fish species in an area. Mr. Corsi added that in Idaho, in Coeur d'Alene National Forest we have from 4 to 10 to 15, up to 20 miles of road per square mile, so it is extreme. That is his direct quote. 
Many scientists have found that road building threatens wildlife because it causes erosions of soils, fragments intact forest ecosystems, encourages the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species and reduces habitat for many animals needing a refuge from man. 
It has been found that when the roads wash out they dump rocks and soil on lower slopes into stream beds and even when they remain intact, roads act as channels for water and contribute further to the erosion of lands and streams. 
Let me invite my colleagues' attention to one example of that. This is the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho. At the top of the picture one can see a road cut through the forest. This is the erosion that has occurred as a result of a road having been logged and the runoff sedimentation that has occurred as a consequence of that. That is a major contributing problem to the environmental degradation that is occurring in our national forests. 
Scientists say the overall effect is that the streams and rivers fill with silt, and the shallower waters mean degraded fish habitat and more flooding. Many of my colleagues are aware that the declining water quality of lakes, rivers, and streams in our national forests is a serious problem. 
The USDA Undersecretary Jim Lyons has stated that our No. 1 water quality problem in the national forest system is roads. According to the Forest Service, 922 communities get their drinking waters from national forest streams that are frequently adversely affected by building logging roads. In Idaho, over 960 streams are rated as water-quality limited by the EPA because of contamination. Over half of these streams are degraded by logging and roadbuilding. In addition, after the winter storms of 1995 and 1996 in the Pacific Northwest, the Forest Service found that in Idaho 70 percent of the 422 landslides were associated with logging. 
In my home State of Nevada, the road network through Lake Tahoe has been identified as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality and decline in the clarity of the lake. Mr. President, I know this firsthand, having spent a decade of my life as a resident of northern Nevada and having over the last 50 years visited the Lake Tahoe basin frequently. 
During the President and Vice President's recent visit to Lake Tahoe the President announced that the Forest Service would decommission or obliterate roughly 290 miles of old logging roads in the basin over the next 10 years. 
At Lake Tahoe, Mr. President, we have seen a rapid and radical decline in water clarity. One of the most pristine lakes in North America and the entire world, marveled at by Mark Twain and all of the early pioneers at one time, a little more than a decade ago, you could see 100 feet into the bottom of parts of that lake. In less than 30 years there has been an environmental degradation of more than a third. So today you can actually see, in terms of clarity of the water, less than 70 feet. A primary cause is the logging of that basin, initially during the Comstock Lode and the mining discoveries of the mid-to-late 19th century. 
I observed firsthand, not as a scientist but as a layman, looking at the roads and seeing the runoff that occurs. The 
siltation that occurs, that goes into the lake, has been a serious environmental problem. It has been estimated that it will require several hundred millions of dollars in order for this clarity and the environmental degradation that is occurring on an ongoing basis to be reversed. There are no guarantees, even at that. 
My point, Mr. President, is we may have been ignorant in the past as to what caused the problems. Those of our forebears a century ago were less knowledgeable than we are of the environmental consequences. But it certainly cannot be an excuse for our generation because we know what the costs are, and the costs are not just in the new road construction itself. The costs lasts for generations thereafter as we pay as American taxpayers to try to abate or minimize or mitigate the damage that will occur. 
Now, opponents of this amendment will claim that forest roads need money to be maintained and that the cuts contained in my amendment will allow roads to deteriorate, causing further environmental damage. I want to speak to this point. The amendment which I offer does not affect the Forest Service road maintenance budget. I want to repeat that: The amendment which is offered this afternoon does not affect the Forest Service road maintenance budget. This amendment only eliminates the subsidy of new timber roads. These are entirely separately funded accounts within the Forest System. 
As a matter of public policy, I would argue it makes more sense to maintain roads that we already have than spending a great deal of money building new roads. Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck has stated that there is a $440 million backlog of maintenance needed on 232,000 miles of national forest roads. Addressing this need would have considerable environmental benefits such as reducing erosion from roads and stormproofing existing culverts. It is important to remember that the timber industry's responsibility for maintaining logging roads ends with the sale of timber and its subsequent harvest, leaving all future maintenance costs to the American taxpayer. 
I want to emphasize once again, as I did a moment ago, the distinction between road reconstruction and road maintenance. Opponents of this amendment will seek to measure the distinction but road construction means starting with an abandoned road which may have trees growing in it and may be partly contoured and rebuilding it for the purpose of entering an area to conduct logging activities. 
Reconstruction is only undertaken for access to timber sales. Maintenance is keeping any forest road, timber, recreation, or general purpose, in good repair. The average cost of maintaining a mile of road is about $543. The average cost of reconstructing a mile of road is more than $12,000 a mile. Consequently, cutting funds for reconstruction will not hurt road maintenance. 
Now, another erroneous claim I want to address involves whether logging roads are needed for recreational activities in the national forest. The answer, Mr. President, is no. According to the Forest Service, logging roads are built at a lower standard and cost less than recreation and general purpose roads. Logging roads are usually unpaved dirt and are often usable only by high-clearance vehicles, while recreation and general purpose roads generally are either paved or gravel and are usable by all passenger cars. 
On average, purchaser credit logging roads cost $15,000 per mile in 1996, while recreation roads cost $63,000, and general purpose roads cost $65,000 per mile. The Forest Service plans to construct over 130 miles of recreation and general purpose roads in fiscal year 1998. My amendment would not reduce funding for either of these two accounts. 
Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear on what my amendment does not do. It does not--I repeat, it does not--prohibit logging or road construction in roadless areas. There is no provision in this amendment that even references roadless areas. Many interest groups opposed to this amendment have circulated erroneous information claiming that road construction would be prohibited in roadless areas. I can assure my colleagues that is not the case. In any event, roadless areas are only a small portion of the timber base in our national forests, and the national forests provide only 4 percent of the Nation's overall wood for paper products. 
Let me illustrate that point, if I may, Mr. President. One can see what has occurred in terms of the timber harvest in the country and on the national forests. This chart begins in 1950 and continues through 1995. We can see that the overall U.S. timber harvest, both national forests and otherwise, has by and large increased over the last 45 years. It would appear to be in the area of about 18 billion cubic feet a year. You can also see what happened with respect to the national forests. The amount that is harvested there has been declining in recent years, and I believe that is because there is a recognition that there are other important values that the National Forest Service provides to the American people: recreational opportunities, esthetic values, habitat protection, all of which seem to be reflected in this trend line. 
So my point is that the National Forest Service timber harvest represents about 4 percent of the Nation's overall harvest and, in my view, will not have an economic consequence that will, in any way, make it impossible for the United States to meet its harvest requirements. 
Now, my amendment does not eliminate all funding for timber road construction either. A similar amendment was offered in the House by Congressman Porter and Congressman Kennedy, which would have eliminated virtually all funding for timber road construction. That amendment, incidentally, was very, very narrowly defeated on a vote of 211 to 209. Let me make the point again. The Porter-Kennedy amendment would have eliminated virtually all funding for new timber road construction. 
My amendment would reduce the amount of the current appropriation, as proposed, by $10 million, reducing it from a $47.4 million budget. Opponents of this amendment are somewhat disingenuous when they claim that it will decimate the timber road construction program. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to make my colleagues aware that this amendment has the strong support of the Clinton administration. I want to introduce into the Record a copy of the letter from the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. Dan Glickman.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, Secretary Glickman's letter is in strong support of the amendment that I am offering this afternoon. I also add, Mr. President, that the amendment is also strongly supported by a broad coalition of environmental and taxpayer organizations, including the Wilderness Society, Sierra Club, Friends of Earth, U.S. PERG, Taxpayers for Common Sense, and Citizens Against Government Waste. In addition, more than 60 newspapers across the country have editorialized in support of the amendment. 
I simply close by making this observation, and I ask my colleagues to consider this one important point. If the purchaser credit program is not a subsidy for the timber purchasers, as the opponents of this amendment claim, then why are they fighting so hard to preserve it? 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues can join with those advocates of the environment, those advocates of responsible governmental fiscal practices and support this amendment, because it is a win for the environment and a win for the American taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time. I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I might have. I was somewhat astounded by the debate because those who oppose the amendment try to frame an issue that is not part of our discussion or our amendment today. I think in so doing they are trying to obfuscate the issues we are dealing with. This amendment is not about eliminating all timber harvests on the national forests. That may be an appropriate subject for a debate on another day. But there is not one word in this amendment that would have that effect or seeks to accomplish that purpose. 
The other argument that has been made to obfuscate the issues is somehow a suggestion that there is an attempt here to eliminate all new road construction in the national forests. That is not true as well. 
Let me just respond to the comments that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania just made. We have crafted this amendment to protect and to hold the counties who receive revenue from this program to hold them harmless. We do so by saying, look, in the bid that is offered by the prospective timber harvest bidder, that we factor a separate amount that would be attributable to the construction component and use that, as well as the bid price, in the calculation to determine what moneys will go to the individual counties that will be affected. So we were sensitive to the needs of the individual counties that would be affected and this amendment holds them harmless. 
Let me talk about what the thrust of this amendment is. The thrust of this amendment is to eliminate a subsidy. It is to eliminate corporate welfare. It is to eliminate food stamps for the timber industry. That is not just an assertion the Senator from Nevada makes. That is why groups such as Citizens Against Government Waste, which have identified this as a costly subsidy to the American taxpayer, support the Bryan amendment. That is why Taxpayers for Common Sense, also a taxpayer watchdog group, has supported the Bryan amendment, because they recognize that this is a subsidy. That is why 60 leading newspapers across America from coast to coast--the only two notable exceptions that I am familiar with are the two that were referenced by the Senator from Oregon in his comments--all recognize this to be a subsidy and have urged its elimination. 
Why is it a subsidy? It is a subsidy because individuals who have analyzed it and see how the Purchaser Credit Program worked finds that a windfall tax break occurs in terms of the profits that are permitted under this. Let me describe that in more detail, if I may. 
The Forest Service makes a determination as to what they estimate the road costs are to be when a bidder bids on a tract of timber that requires road construction, and that is made available immediately to the successful bidder--immediately. That is a credit that is made available. 
Those who have looked at the way the Forest Service calculates that have indicated, No. 1, the Forest Service is calculating a profit into that estimate and, No. 2, those who have focused on it independently found that in some instances, the purchaser road credit exceeds by 30 percent the actual cost that the timber harvester incurs in building the roads. Because, Mr. President, there is no accounting or accountability, the amount of money that is saved by the timber harvester that would be substantially less cost to him than the purchaser credit makes available is retained by the timber bidder, and that becomes a windfall profit. That is what the various groups, the taxpayer groups, as well as the 60 or more editorial writers across the country, have focused on--that it is a subsidy and a subsidy that ought to be eliminated. 
Third, let me talk for a moment about the environmental consequences. We have 380,000 miles of roads in the National Forest System. That is about eight times the length of the interstate system. We have an enormous backlog of maintenance on existing roads. It is clear that new road construction, particularly in those environmentally sensitive areas that are steep, that have serious drainage and grading problems, cost the American taxpayer not just the initial cost for the road construction, but in some instances for generations thereafter. We deal with the problems of erosion, sedimentation and siltation into the rivers, streams, and lakes in the national forests. That is why the Assistant Secretary has commented that the greatest threat to 
the water resource in the national forest system is roads and new construction which is a major factor in that. 
Finally, let me set at rest the notion that somehow these forest roads that will be built for new timber harvests are somehow a great benefit to the outdoor recreationalists. There are different categories of roads. 
Typically, a road that is involved in a construction to access harvest timber is a dirt road. It is accessible only by all-terrain vehicles. It is not accessible by passenger vehicles. It is unpaved. It is ungraded. It doesn't have gravel on it. Whereas, recreational roads are roads of a higher quality that are accessible by passenger and general recreational vehicles. 
Let me say that one of the groups that is a watchguard for outdoor recreational users is the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, which is part of the Outdoor Products Council. Mr. President, here is what they have to say about this subsidy and the purchaser road credit and the Bryan amendment:  
Our national forests are a recreational attraction because of their wild unspoiled areas. We feel that taxpayer subsidies for logging road construction has led to an extensive logging road network that can actually place at risk the very resources upon which recreational users of our national forests depend. 
The recreational users and their interest groups support the Bryan amendment because they recognize that the Purchaser Credit Program is, in fact, a corporate subsidy, corporate welfare and they recognize the environmental consequences of senseless and unnecessary new road construction. 
Finally, if I may, to clarify the point that in the Forest Service accounts there is a separate category for maintenance of existing roads. The Bryan amendment, which could reduce by $10 million the amount of money appropriated for new road construction, does not--does not--in any way affect or reduce those moneys that are set aside for the maintenance accounts. So no one ought to be misled that in some way the reduction that we are talking about would in any way impact those ongoing activities of erosion control and maintenance of existing roads. 
To conclude, Mr. President, this is a win-win. It is a win for the American taxpayers because we eliminate a costly subsidy that simply cannot be justified and to provide windfall profits for some of the largest timber harvesters in America. Common sense suggests that, indeed, it must be a very powerful and a very substantial subsidy, or why else would we have the opposition to the Purchaser Road Credit Program if it did not provide such a subsidy? If it has been suggested by those who oppose the amendment it is a wash and an offset, I do not see why they would be raising the concerns and objections they have. 
Second, it is a great win for the environment, because we know one of the leading causes of environmental degradation is the kind of erosion and runoff that we have as a result of these roads that have been cut through our national forests, and we ought to be very, very careful and sensitive when we construct new roads. 
Mr. President, for the American taxpayer, for the American people, this is sound policy. Your vote will be appreciated. 
May I inquire of the Chair whether or not the amendment reflects the cosponsorship of John Kerry, Barbara Boxer, and Senator Bob Torricelli? If it does not, I ask unanimous consent that they be added as cosponsors.

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. I assure my colleagues I will not take the full 6 minutes. But let me respond to the concern that the Senator from Wyoming has voiced with respect to the county schooling. 
We have crafted into the amendment a hold-harmless provision that recognizes that indeed this is an important revenue source for local governments. I can assure my colleagues that the purpose of this amendment, or its effect, will in no way affect that program. We specifically incorporated that in there. 
Let me just again return to the issue of the subsidy because I think that is central to the issue. I mean, if this is not a subsidy, why do we go through all of the incantation of calculating a separate purchaser credit, making that available? Why don't we simply just eliminate that and say, as do BLM harvesters, and in some State forest programs, the individual who is bidding on a tract of timber would factor into his or her, or its or their, costs what their road construction cost would be. That creates a competitive market, a level playing field. Why go through all of this incantation of developing the purchaser road credits? 
Mr. President, I think the answer is clear. This has conferred an enormous benefit to the timber harvester. For one, the GAO has indicated that the Forest Service itself, in calculating the purchaser road credit, factors in a profit--factors in a profit. That is not a wash. That is not a recovery of costs. That is cost plus a profit. 
If we are advocates of truth in budgeting, let us just eliminate that gimmick and simply say to all who harvest in the national forests, submit your bids, and included in your bid will be the cost that you will incur in accessing the tract of timber, or for those that involve new road constructions, you will factor that in. 
Second, with the exception of the Forest Service industry itself, virtually every outside analyst, the taxpayer groups, editorial writers across the country, those who have been commissioned to do independent surveys, have all concluded that, indeed, when one examines the cost of the credit that is provided to the timber harvester and examines the cost incurred by the timber harvester, in some instances the timber harvester's costs are 30 percent less than the credit that is provided to the timber harvester. 
Those are taxpayer resources. Those are taxpayer assets. That is clearly the definition of a subsidy. It goes far beyond what the cost incurred by the timber harvester is and provides him or her, it or them, with a costly subsidy at taxpayer expense. 
That is why from the west coast to the east coast, from north to south, editorial writers, commenters, and analysts have looked at this and said, `This is a program that we cannot support.' If we are talking about being fair and honest with the taxpayers' money, how can we support a program that is under a very convoluted, difficult-to-explain and, I am sure, difficult-to-understand purchaser credit program where in effect what we are doing, however we disguise it, is providing additional profits to a timber harvester? 
That simply is not right. I believe any responsible budgetary analysis reveals that that is in fact what has occurred. The Forest Service itself recognizes that practice. That is why they support the amendment. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Bryan amendment. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I want to tell you, first of all, what this amendment is not about. This amendment is not about timber harvesting in the national forests. It does not prevent it. And it does not prevent the construction of new roads in the national forests for purposes of timber access. 
What it does is to eliminate a costly taxpayer subsidy that is part of the Forest Service program, a subsidy that has been roundly denounced, and correctly so, by virtually every taxpayer group in America, such as Citizens Against Government Waste and Taxpayers for Common Sense, because it cannot be justified. 
Second, this is an important environmental vote, perhaps our most important environmental vote to date because we reduce by $10 million an amount of money that is appropriated for new road construction in the national forests. 
The amendment does absolutely nothing to reduce or to impede the accounts that are provided for in the maintenance of roads in the National Park System. 
So Mr. President, I urge support of the Bryan amendment because it is truth in budgeting and makes sense from a fiscal point of view and because environmentally it is sound policy for the Nation.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will protect consumers from a new, egregious banking practice that gives new meaning to the old expression, `The check's in the mail.' 
This practice involves financial institutions sending unsolicited checks to consumers, some of whom have no prior relationship with the financial institution at all. These checks in fact obligate the recipient to a loan with interest rates as high as 25 percent. 
I invite my colleagues' attention to a format that is frequently used. This check is sent in a window envelope in which the recipient sees his or her name, opens it up and believes that indeed a check has been sent to him or to her. 
What may at first appear to be pennies from Heaven is in reality a loan backed by exorbitant interest rates and punitive loan terms, but these details are only found in the fine print often on the back of the check. 
While only a few banks are engaged in this practice, it is nevertheless a growing practice and needs to be stopped before it gets completely out of hand. For example, one bank has booked $1 billion of these unsolicited loans in a period of 18 months. 
At a time when personal bankruptcies are at an all-time high --many attribute that to easy credit-card debt--the practice in which consumers are enticed into taking a loan that they really have not sought should concern all Americans. 
I fear for the long-term consequence of these loans should the economy take a sudden downturn and these loans are left in default. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is loans should only be issued when an application has been made and approved, with the consumer fully understanding the terms of the loan. In the case of these loans, all the pertinent information consumers need to know about fees, charges, interest rates is in microscopic print and most frequently on the back of the check itself. 
Mr. President, banks are trying the patience of the American consumer with their ever increasing use of fees and questionable market practices. 
My State of Nevada has gone through a series of bank mergers that have left customers frustrated and confused. Service has been downgraded, accounts lost and fees increased. According to one report, the number of types of fees charged by banks increased from 96 to 250 while the banking industry itself continues to earn record profits--surpassing $50 billion. 
These unsolicited checks are setting rates right up against the usury ceilings with some carrying rates as high as 25 percent. Adding insult to injury, these checks are targeted to people who can least afford to pay these exorbitant rates but are easily tempted by the lure of easy money. 
Mr. President, I want to commend Congressmen Hinchey and Gonzalez in the House for raising this issue. I look forward to the Banking Committee holding hearings on this important legislation. The distinguished chairman of the subcommittee has indicated that it is his intention to hold hearings on this issue. I look forward to processing this legislation as quickly as possible.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement before us is an historic document. The agreement puts us on the path to a balanced budget in 2002, the first balanced budget since 1969. 
The agreement contains significant changes for Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare. The Children's Health Insurance Initiative is also a momentous move toward ensuring all children in this country will not want for lack of health care. 
This was my first year as a new member of the Senate Finance Committee. The committee spent many hours debating and considering the myriad of issues involved in developing the Medicare and other health areas of this budget bill. These issues were complex, the debate long, and decisions very difficult to make. As with any far-reaching legislation, no one, including myself, agrees with every provision included.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join many of my colleagues from the West today in introducing the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997. 
The mining industry has always played an important role in our national economy, and particularly in the economies of many western States. From the discovery of the Comstock Lode in the 19th century, to the silver boom of the Goldfield-Tonopah area in the early 20th century, to the record levels of gold and silver production in the last decade, the mineral industry has historically played a vital role in Nevada's economy. For the fifth year in a row, Nevada's mines have collectively topped the 6 million ounce mark in gold production. In 1996, there was a total of 7.08 million ounces of gold produced in Nevada. The State's rich landscape has made Nevada the largest gold producer in the nation with 66.5 percent of all production. In addition, it now accounts for 10 percent of all the gold in the world. 
The most recent information from the State of Nevada indicates that direct mining employment in Nevada exceeds 13,000 jobs. The average annual pay for these jobs, the highest of any sector in the state, is about $46,000, compared to the average salary in Nevada of about $26,000 per year. In addition to the direct employment in mining, there are an estimated 36,000 jobs in the state related to providing goods and services needed by the industry. 
I would also like to note that Nevada mining companies must pay taxes like any other business, and they also pay an additional Nevada tax called the `Net Proceeds of Mines Tax.' The total Net Proceeds tax paid to the State in 1995 was approximately $33 million. With the addition of sales and property tax, the industry paid approximately $141 million in State and local taxes in 1995. In addition, the Nevada mining industry paid approximately $95 million in Federal taxes in 1995. 
The figures and statistics I have just mentioned are significant not only to emphasize the importance of the mining industry to the State of Nevada, but also to provide a context for the criticism often leveled against the industry that they enjoy a free ride for mining activities on Federal land. The bottom line is that the mining industry pays taxes just like any other business, and in Nevada they pay an additional tax targeted specifically to their industry. 
The issue of reclamation is also central to the mining law reform debate. I should note that Nevada has one of the toughest, if not the toughest, State reclamation programs in the country. Nevada mining companies are subject to a myriad of Federal and State environmental laws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and Endangered Species Act. Mining companies must secure literally dozens of environmental permits prior to commencing mining activities, including a reclamation permit, which must be obtained before a mineral exploration project or mining operation can be conducted. Companies must also file a surety or bond with the State or the Federal land manager in an amount sufficient to ensure reclamation of the entire site prior to receiving a reclamation permit. 
It is in the context of promoting the economic viability of the mining industry and of encouraging strong environmental reclamation efforts administered by the States that I view the debate over the reform of the Mining Law of 1872. As I have stated many times over the years, I feel that certain aspects of the 1872 mining law are in need of reform. Specifically, I feel strongly that the patenting provision of the current law should be changed to provide for the payment of fair market value for the surface estate--our legislation does that. All patents should also include a reverter clause, which would ensure that patented public lands would revert to Federal ownership if no longer used for mining purposes--our legislation does that. I believe that mining laws reform legislation should ensure that any land used for mining purposes must be reclaimed pursuant to applicable Federal and State statutes--our legislation does that. And finally, I believe that mining law reform legislation should impose a reasonable royalty on mineral production from Federal land--our legislation does that. 
The Mining Law Reform Act of 1997 addresses each of the concerns I have just outlined. It is my hope that this legislation will serve as the starting point for the debate over mining law reform this year. 
The time has never been more critical for Congress to enact comprehensive mining law reform. The aura of uncertainty that the industry has been forced to operate under for the last decade is causing many companies to look overseas for their future operations. The number of United States and Canadian mining companies exploring or operating in Latin America continues to grow dramatically. We must enact mining reform this Congress if we hope to secure the economic benefits we derive as a Nation from a healthy mining industry.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the senior Senator from California. 
Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the senior Senator from California. In my view, and I speak as one who has appeared before the ninth circuit as an attorney, the provision included in this appropriation bill to divide the ninth circuit and create a new 12th circuit is inappropriate, ill-conceived and ill-advised. I must express my dismay that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee have seen fit to usurp the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee on this matter. If there was ever an issue that deserved to be considered in a thoughtful and careful manner by the Judiciary Committee, it is the issue of reforming our Federal court system. 
The Commerce, Justice, State appropriation bill is clearly not an appropriate venue to debate an issue of this magnitude, one that will have far-reaching policy implications, not only for those of us in the West but for the entire Nation. 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997 would reformulate the ninth circuit to include California, Nevada and the Pacific territories, and create a new twelfth circuit consisting of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. 
In the 104th Congress, the distinguished senior Senator from Washington introduced legislation that would have placed California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific territories in the ninth circuit. That legislation was later modified by the Judiciary Committee to establish a new ninth circuit consisting of California, Hawaii and the Pacific territories, and I have been further advised that at one time a proposal was floating around that would divide northern and southern California into separate circuits. 
I mention these various iterations of dividing the ninth circuit to make the point that there is a variety of views as to how best to address the ninth circuit and whether or not it should be divided, and, if so, how it should be divided. But in my view, it is clear the proposal to divide the ninth circuit is more reflective of an act of political expediency than the prudential concerns related to the administration of justice. The sponsors of this provision claim that the ninth circuit is unable to effectively manage its caseload because it has grown too big and that the solution to this perceived problem is to divide the circuit. But this, I fear, is only a smokescreen, for the real reason splitting the ninth circuit being proposed at this time is simply that many do not like the decisions rendered by the circuit. 
While they will not admit that one purpose of dividing the ninth circuit is to change the substantive outcomes of decisions, the sponsors have made clear their displeasure with many decisions issued by the court, particularly in the area of natural resource protection. Surely not all of the decisions in the ninth circuit, or for that matter any circuit, come down the way that all of us would like. I, myself, have cosponsored legislation that would reverse the effect of some of the ninth circuit decisions. But I do not believe that differences over the decisions rendered by the ninth circuit are an adequate basis to split the circuit. 
What kind of precedent would the Congress then be setting? Would a circuit court of appeals face possible reconfiguration whenever Congress does not like the decisions being rendered? Does this Congress really want to support what is essentially judicial gerrymandering? I hope not. The ninth circuit serves nine Western States and has been one circuit for more than 100 years. Whenever the issue of splitting the circuit is put to a vote of the judges and lawyers in the circuit, the vote has been overwhelmingly to retain the circuit as it is currently constituted. 
Who better than those judges who comprise the circuit and those lawyers who represent litigants before the ninth circuit to determine whether or not the ninth circuit is working effectively or not? 
It has been my experience that neither judges nor lawyers have been shy about stating an opinion when they think something needs to be changed. 
The last study of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals was by the 1973 Hruska Commission. A fellow Nevadan, the Honorable Charles Wiggins, a ninth circuit court judge, served as a member of that commission. Parenthetically, Judge Wiggins first served as a Republican Member of the House before serving on the ninth circuit. In a letter to California's senior Senator, he stated: 
My understanding of the role of the circuit courts in our system of Federal justice has changed over the years from that which I held when the Hruska Commission issued its final report in 1973. At that time, I endorsed the recommendations of the Commission calling for a division of the fifth and ninth circuits. I have grown wiser in the succeeding 22 years. 
We should heed Judge Wiggins' experience--act wisely and not precipitously in dividing this circuit. 
The last time a circuit court of appeals split was in 1980 when the fifth circuit was divided and the eleventh created. It should be noted that the judges of the fifth circuit unanimously requested the split, a situation we clearly do not have with the ninth circuit. 
In a recent letter, Judge Wiggins wrote me: 
Circuit division is not the answer. It has not proved effective in reducing delays. The former fifth circuit ranked sixth in case processing times just prior to its division into the fifth and eleventh circuits. Since the division, the new fifth circuit is still ranked fifth or seventh, while the new eleventh circuit now ranks 12th, the slowest of all circuits. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges are the fastest in the Nation in disposing of cases once the panel has received the case. 
So the ninth circuit would appear to take the appropriate administrative steps to manage its caseloads through innovative ways that other circuits use as models. 
The ninth circuit disposes of cases in 1.9 months from oral argument to rendering a decision. That is less than the national average by 2 weeks. This currently makes the ninth circuit the second most efficient circuit in the country. 
So it is obvious the circuit has recognized caseload management is an area that needs improving and is successfully addressing it. 
I find it particularly ironic that in this political environment in which budget decisions are hotly debated and new expenditures are closely watched that a new circuit would be proposed, because it is estimated that a courthouse alone would cost some $60 million and there would be additional costs that would be involved in the transition period. So, therefore, we would face the continuing cost of operating an additional circuit court when, at this point, no determination has been made in a fair and objective way that dividing the circuit is necessary. 
In my view, the ninth circuit has worked well for the nine Western States it serves and will continue to do so into the future. For those who believe the ninth circuit must be split, I urge the support of the Feinstein amendment to establish a 
commission to review the structure and the alignment of the Federal courts of appeals. This is a thoughtful and prudent way to address this issue. 
When the information necessary to determine whether any circuits need their geographical jurisdiction changed is available, we can then debate this issue more intelligently, having been thoroughly informed as to the facts. But let us not split the ninth circuit at this time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 7 1/2 minutes. 
Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today, along with Senator Kerry, Senator Gregg, and Senator Grams, addresses a continuing misuse of taxpayer dollars by the now infamous Market Access Program, which has previously been known as the Market Promotion Program, and before that the Targeted Export Assistance Program. 
As most Senators know, I have worked to eliminate this unjustifiable program for more than 5 years. But the resilient program keeps coming back to life under different names and without the consent of the full Senate. When efforts to eliminate the program have been blocked, I have tried to reform the program and end its subsidies to large corporate and foreign interests. Twice now the Senate has voted to reduce funding for this program to a level of $70 million annually, and twice the funding has been restored off the Senate floor. 
Today, I am asking the Senate to join me once again to put an end to this program's abuses. It is inexcusable to allow this program to continue to funnel Americans hard-earned tax dollars to foreign companies to subsidize their advertising budgets. When the Market Access Program was created more than 10 years ago it was called the Targeted Export Assistance Program and was intended to be used by trade organizations to counter unfair trading practices by foreign competitors to disadvantage U.S. exports, and reduce funds from the Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation to promote U.S. goods in foreign markets. I don't think that anyone would disagree that expanding foreign markets for U.S. products is an important part of the overall competitive trade strategy. However, as this program evolved over the past 10 years the program was no longer limited to exporters facing unfair competition. Even as this body labored to cut back on Federal expenditures, scarce U.S. tax dollars continued to flow to major U.S. corporations as well as to foreign companies. 
Make no mistake. We are talking about more than $1.5 billion given away to corporate entities over the past decade. Unlike the Promotion Assistance Program provided through the Department of Commerce, these are grants. So they are never repaid. 
From 1986 to 1993, nearly $100 million of Market Promotion Program funds went to foreign companies. From 1993 to 1995, the program gave roughly $10 million to $12 million each year to foreign corporations. 
Many of my colleagues will recall that I joined with the distinguished ranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, to try to end this blatant waste of taxpayer dollars, and the Senate backed us in our efforts. During consideration of the 1996 farm bill, the Senate voted 59 to 37 in favor of my amendment to prevent Market Access Program funds from flowing to foreign companies. The amendment provided that only `small business,' as defined by the Small Business Administration, and Kapra Vaultsted Cooperatives, would provide for assistance through programs. 
In addition, funds for the program which were at that time set at $110 million were capped at $70 million. So the Senate has been on record to limit the amount of money in this program at $70 million and to eliminate money from this program going to foreign companies. 
I make it clear. My preference would be to eliminate the entire program because I believe this is corporate welfare in its worst form. That has not been the will of the Senate. But twice the Senate has been on record capping this program and preventing money from going to foreign companies. 
In reviewing the action of the Foreign Agriculture Service since the 1996 farm bill changes took effect, it is clear however, that the Foreign Agriculture Service has not carried out the intent of the Senate in spite of the Senate's action to bar the distribution of Market Access Program funds to foreign companies. Companies based in the United Kingdom, Australia, and Saudi Arabia received more than $475,000 in fiscal year 1996 through this same program. 
There is a partial list of foreign companies that received funds after the Senate added in the 1996 agriculture bill a prohibition against money going to foreign companies. They did it by an ingenious but somewhat convoluted definition of what constitutes a foreign company. 
The purpose of this amendment is simply to do what the Senate has gone on record to do twice before, and that is to cap the amount of money going into the program at $70 million and to prevent money from going to foreign companies. 
I ask my colleagues to be supportive of this amendment. 
If I might cite an example. The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute has received $55 million through this program since 1987. Supporters of this corporate giveaway would no doubt point out the importance of supporting Alaskan industry in foreign markets. But the Alaskan Seafood Marketing Institute 
gave at least $724,000 to USDA-listed foreign corporations in 1996 alone. 
So I must say it boggles the mind to imagine how much money has gone to these same companies since the program began in 1986. 
The National Peanut Council in 1996 distributed $50,000 to Internut Germany, $60,000 to Felix Polska, and $30,000 to the Basamh Trading Company of Saudi Arabia. All three of these companies were openly listed as foreign on the USDA list in past years. Yet, they continue to receive funds from the Market Access Program.

Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself another 4 minutes, and I would certainly provide whatever time the distinguished ranking member would like to speak if he chooses to comment on this. 
Madam President, let me just point out that this program ought to be eliminated. The Senate has been resistant. But the Senate has gone on record twice as having said the program ought to be limited to $70 million. The present level would be $90 million. 
So this amendment seeks to in effect do what the Senate twice has gone on record as trying to accomplish. 
Second, my colleagues will recall that the other part of the amendment that we offered was passed by a vote of 59 to 31, which, I believe, was to eliminate money going to foreign companies. 
The bureaucracy is extraordinarily creative and ingenious. So companies that have historically since the advent of this program back in the 1980's were designated as foreign companies miraculously under a new definition after the Congress--this is the current law--went on record as saying not to allow this money to go to foreign companies. They have redefined `foreign companies' as `nonforeign' or `domestic companies' for purposes of this legislation. 
So one of the reforms that we thought that we got enacted in the last Congress--that is, to eliminate the flow of money to companies like this to Saudi Arabia, to France, to the Netherlands, to Germany, to Canada, the United Kingdom, and other companies. We thought we had closed that door. But the Foreign Agriculture Service had redefined what constitutes a foreign company. 
So what this amendment tries to do is to reinstate the intent of the Senate as passed by an overwhelming margin, and is currently the law to prohibit the flow of money in this program, the taxpayer dollars to foreign companies. 
I hope my colleagues will be supportive of this amendment as they have on two previous occasions. 
I yield the floor but reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. BRYAN. My friend and colleague from Mississippi propounded, I think, a very fair question. Whose side are you on? Those who support the Bryan amendment are on the side of the American taxpayer. I believe that whether you come from a farm State or nonfarm State, when you are told that your hard-earned tax dollars go to foreign companies, that is offensive. I think it is not only offensive, it is without justification. 
How can we call upon the American people, in effect, to subsidize foreign companies with their own tax dollars. It is my view that this program is corporate welfare. It is also my view that this program ought to be eliminated. But that is not the issue today. The issue today is whether you favor cutting off money, taxpayer dollars, to foreign companies such as these that are illustrated here from Saudi Arabia, from France, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. We tried to do that. We tried to do that. But the bureaucrats have come up with some convoluted definition of what constitutes a foreign company that now makes it possible for foreign companies to receive these moneys notwithstanding the overwhelming vote of the Senate to express its displeasure. 
I could not resist a comment when my friend from Mississippi talked about the reforms that have taken place. This is a program that is in need of elimination. But I will say to you that the General Accounting Office as recently as March of this year had this to say about this Market Access Program, and I quote: 
Adequate assurance does not exist to demonstrate that Market Access Program funds are supporting additional promotional activities rather than simply replacing company industry funds. 
So, in effect, what is occurring here is a big scam, and the American taxpayer is the victim. Companies that receive these subsidies simply reduce the amount of money of their own corporate funds for their advertising budget and have it supplemented at the expense of the taxpayer. That neither encourages nor helps agricultural exports nor helps American agriculture, but it certainly dips deep into the taxpayer pocket, as it has for many, many years. 
This is the time to eliminate one of the fundamental abuses. That is money going to foreign companies. We thought we had done that in the last Congress. This definition in this amendment tightens that loophole that apparently the bureaucrats have been able to find and would put a cap which the Senate has previously voted on at $70 million. 
I will yield the floor and the remainder of my time.

 Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the innumerable contributions and outstanding leadership that have characterized the tenure of the Honorable Jesse Brown as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. It is with great appreciation, as well as sadness, that I speak of his accomplishments today, as his term as the chief of the second-largest agency in the Federal Government will come to an end on the first of July. Under his guidance over the past 4 1/2 years, the Department of Veterans Affairs has undergone some of the most fundamental changes in decades. In the past, such groundbreaking reforms and restructuring may have inspired fear on Capitol Hill and in veterans' facilities across the Nation, but with Jesse Brown at the helm, the Department has undergone a transformation with support, hard-earned at times, from both budget-cutters in Congress and from veterans across the country. 
When Secretary Brown took office in 1993, he was faced with an outdated health-care delivery system stretched to its limits trying to maintain too many large, aging hospitals. The Secretary rose to the challenge by closing hospitals that did not serve their patients well and beginning an overhaul of the entire VA medical system into a network of 22 regional provider regions. Within these regions, increased attention is being given to the quality of care available as well as to outpatient services. These changes, which are still taking hold in many places, demonstrate the vision that Secretary Brown brought to his work; a vision of changing with the times, but never giving up on the primary focus of providing services to veterans. 
Secretary Brown's unyielding drive to ensure that veterans have access to needed services is very important to Nevada, one of only two States in the Nation where the population of veterans is growing. While my State's problems are very different than those of a Northeastern or Midwestern State, Secretary Brown took these differences into account and has been instrumental in helping Nevada be more responsive to the needs of the men and women who have served our country. The Department of Veterans Affairs has begun to reallocate its resources so that Federal funds are made available where veterans' needs are most critical. In southern Nevada, where approximately 118,000 veterans already crowd existing facilities, new projects will allow Nevada's veterans to access doctors, counselors, and other benefits to which they are entitled. The Secretary has helped Nevada's underserved veterans gain access to the services they deserve through his active support for efforts to construct and expand desperately needed medical facilities in southern Nevada. Secretary Brown has come to the aid of Nevada's veterans during crises, as well, stepping in to help find a solution when one of the VA facilities in Nevada faced administrative problems. 
While I could go on much longer just discussing Secretary Brown's contributions to Nevada's veterans, I would be amiss if I did not mention the profound impact he has had on all American veterans and their families. He has tackled the most sensitive issues facing veterans, including his work to enact laws authorizing the VA to provide compensation and treatment for Persian Gulf war veterans' undiagnosed illnesses. He also expanded services to women veterans, which is evident at the new Addeliar D. Guy III Ambulatory Care center soon to open in Las Vegas. Finally, Secretary Brown confirmed the VA's commitment to all veterans in need by convening the first summit on the issues facing homeless veterans, and followed up on this by adding homeless programs to the services provided at VA medical centers. Again, this effort has a great impact in Las Vegas, where a large number of homeless veterans have needs that have, until now, largely gone unmet. With the help of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, however, Las Vegas will soon boast a new initiative that joins hands with the city and county to provide assistance to the homeless veterans in Las Vegas. 
Mr. President, I have only touched upon a few of the many positive changes and initiatives launched by Secretary Brown, and I have not even made mention of his previous service to his country as a soldier in Vietnam or as the director of the Washington office of the Disabled American Veterans. I am sure that Secretary Brown will continue to make this world more livable and more enjoyable for veterans in whatever challenges he pursues in the future, buoyed by his commitment to `putting veterans first.' Whether guaranteeing a home loan for a veteran just returned from a tour overseas, streamlining health care procedures at a local walk-in clinic, or intervening to prevent the eviction of elderly VA nursing home residents, Jesse Brown has proven that he, and the agency he led, do indeed put veterans first. When he announced his resignation, Secretary Brown said he wanted to be remembered as `someone who made a difference in the quality of veterans' lives.' I speak for the veterans of Nevada, and across the country, when I say that Jesse Brown will be remembered not only for improving veterans' access to needed benefits, but also for leading this agency with skill, with compassion, and most of all with an appreciation for the noble service of our Nation's veterans.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I supported this compromise legislation in the Senate Finance Committee, and I intend to support its passage on the floor as well. While there are many aspects of this legislation which I believe could be improved, I applaud Chairman Roth for his efforts to produce a bipartisan, consensus bill that the great majority of the members of the committee could support. 
One of the areas where I believe the bill does not go far enough in correcting flaws in the House Ways and Means bill, however, relates to the treatment of investment in real estate. Since 1963, so-called real estate depreciation recapture resulting from straight line depreciation has been provided the same tax rate as other forms of capital gains. Under current law, this rate is 28 percent. Under the House Ways and Means bill, however, an unfair differential is created between the general capital gains rate, which is capped under the bill at 20 percent, and the tax rate applied to depreciation recapture, which is set at 26 percent. 
Many members of the Senate Finance Committee expressed serious concerns with this inequitable treatment of real estate investment, and significant efforts were made during the committee's consideration of this bill to provide equal treatment for depreciation recapture. Unfortunately, revenue concerns limited our ability to provide the 20 percent rate for depreciation recapture, and, in the end, the committee agreed to lower the rate for depreciation recapture to 24 percent. 
While a better result than the House Ways and Means Committee's 26-percent rate, the 24-percent rate in the Senate Finance bill still does not place real estate investments on an equal footing with other types of investment. 
I urge the leadership of both the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee to reconsider this issue, and, during conference, to restore equal treatment for real estate investment. At a minimum, I urge the conference committee to resist any effort to increase the tax rate for depreciation recapture any higher than the 24 percent included in the Senate bill.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this is the wrong place and the wrong time to be considering an amendment of this nature. This would make a fundamental change in the tax law with respect to the percentage depletion for the recovery of mineral deposits, a provision that has been in the Tax Code for more than six decades. It would discriminate against only one type of mining activity--that which occurs on the public lands. 
The proponents of this amendment really are debating today changes they want to seek in the mining law of 1872. I do not disagree that changes need to be made. We are prepared, in representing a State in which this is such an important industry, to provide for royalty provisions, fair market value of the surface, as well as reclamation efforts. The ore body itself is a wasting asset. So a depletion allowance for mineral recovery is analogous to depreciation permitted on the improvements on real property. So this is not some exotic provision in the Tax Code. It recognizes that the ore body itself will be exhausted in a finite period of time, and it seeks to provide that kind of tax coverage. 
Finally, I want to point out, as my colleague from Utah pointed out, that this would be an administrative nightmare. At least one particular mining activity in my own State is derived at the source of title or possession of the land from six different sources. So you would have to identify where the minerals recovered are from six different sources in order to apply the provisions of the law. 
I urge its rejection.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the proposal to ensure that sufficient radio spectrum is made available for public safety and maintenance of the Nation's critical infrastructure, such as pipeline, railroad, and electric, gas and water utility services. With the success of spectrum auctions for commercial radio services, the FCC has been reluctant to allocate sufficient spectrum for these vital services. This legislation will expand the FCC's authority to auction spectrum, but not at the expense of entities that we have entrusted to protect the safety of life, health and property and to provide essential public services. 
In adopting rules for the use of this new spectrum, I hope the FCC will promote the development of shared public safety/public service radio systems. In Nevada, it was recognized several years ago that it would be prohibitively expensive for any one public safety agency or public service utility to build and maintain a state-of-the-art 2-way radio system to cover this vast territory and provide the service features these various agencies need. Several key public service and public safety organizations took the initiative to pool their resources to build a system that would share backbone infrastructure, such as mountaintop repeater sites and radio frequencies. Through software partitioning, each user has its own discreet and secure virtual private network on this shared infrastructure. The parties first had to secure waivers of the FCC's rules so that nongovernment entities could share public safety frequencies on a not-for-profit basis. Initial system users include the Nevada Department of Transportation, University of Nevada law enforcement personnel, City of North Las Vegas, Sierra Pacific Power Company, and the Nevada Power Company. Other utilities and state and local government agencies are also looking to partner in the system, which currently covers more than half of the State's geography. 
Shared public safety/public safety radio networks such as the one we have pioneered in Nevada have many advantages: First, joint use of a system is a spectrally efficient; second, during disasters and emergencies, there is a great need for interoperability between emergency response agencies and public service utilities that is easily accommodated on the shared system; third, equipment can be loaned from one entity to another on an as-needed basis during specific emergencies or special situations; fourth, other agencies and utilities can be added to the system without system duplication of facilities; fifth, smaller, rural agencies can access state-of-the-art technology that would otherwise be beyond their reach; and sixth, taxpayer and utility ratepayer costs can be significantly reduced. 
Does the Senator from Arizona agree that these shared public safety/public service radio networks should be promoted?

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and I very much appreciate his statement, which I think effectively deals with the amendment that our friend from Arkansas has offered. 
Let me preface my comments while the distinguished Senator from Arkansas is in the Chamber that he noted that at the end of this Congress he will not be a candidate for reelection and this will represent his last Congress as a Member of this body. I must say that I regret the decision of the Senator from Arkansas. He has a distinguished record of public service in his own State as Governor and as a Member of this body. I have been pleased to share common cause with him on many, many issues which I believe in his public policy pronouncements are correct for the country, and he, indeed, has been a visionary in some of the things he wishes to do. 
I do not quarrel for one moment with his sincerity. I know the depth of his conviction and I know them to be deeply entertained. I believe, however, that the Senator's zeal for this issue has obscured some of the facts that I think important for us to understand before we follow the course of action that he would suggest to us. 
First, I want to point out the importance of this industry to my own State and to correct what is oftentimes, because of an oversimplified presentation, an impression that is given that the industry pays no taxes. We hear this continuously in the course of the debate on the mining law of 1872. 
According to the National Mining Association, the industry, coal and hard rock, paid more than $600 million in Federal taxes in 1995. The General Accounting Office issued a report recently --this is not a publication that emanates from the mining industry but a General Accounting Office report--that indicates the average tax rate for the mining industry from 1987 to 1992 was 35 percent. Now, that is compared with 23 percent for the automobile industry, 19 percent for the chemical industry, and 33 percent for the transportation industry. In Nevada alone, the gold mining industry paid more than $141 million in State and local taxes in 1995, including $32.7 million in property taxes. 
So let no one who is listening to this argument be misled that the industry pays no taxes, that it is given a free ride. That simply is not true. The industry pays a substantial amount of taxes at the Federal level, at the State level, and at the local level. 
This issue really is not about the depletion allowance. This is really the stalking horse for an issue which we have been debating for some years, and that is the mining law of 1872. There is no disagreement among Members that the mining law of 1872 needs to be updated and modernized. The industry recognizes that and is in agreement, and my colleague from 
Arkansas recognizes that. And there is, indeed, fundamental agreement on the general areas that need to be updated. 
Let me just refresh my colleagues' memories and identify the issues. The industry acknowledges that a royalty needs to be paid, and they are prepared to pay a 5 percent net proceeds royalty. 
Now, there is a difference as to how much the industry should pay, but there is a recognition on behalf of the industry that a net proceeds royalty tax is appropriate and the industry is prepared to pay that. 
Second, there is a recognition that the mining law of 1872 needs to be changed, and those who gain access pursuant to the law of 1872 need to pay a fair market value for the surface estate, in addition to the royalty which I have just indicated. That is a second area of agreement, the fair market value. 
Third, there is a fundamental recognition, if entry is gained as it is under the mining law of 1872 and there is no longer utilization of the land for that purpose, of the possibility of revert, allowing the Secretary of the Interior to revoke the authority and to reenter the lands at his discretion. 
There is a recognition of the need to pay a permanent maintenance fee for every claim that is held on Federal lands, and that fee needs to be made permanent; that an abandoned mines land fund should be established, and that as part of that a reclamation requirement be imposed as well.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as I have indicated, there is broad agreement within the industry that the mining law of 1872 needs to be updated. There is agreement in those areas that have been identified as: 5 percent net proceeds royalty; the fair market value of the surface estate; that a reverter provision be provided so that in the event the property is no longer used for mining purposes, the Secretary of the Interior would have the right to reclaim the land for public purposes; that there be a reclamation requirement and a permanent maintenance fee as part of that reclamation. So, there is a broad agreement that the mining law of 1872 needs to be reformed. 
In the context of this debate, the issue is not whether the mining law of 1872 should remain inviolate, unchanged and sacrosanct, it is a question of how it needs to be updated to reflect the realities of the latter part of the 20th century. In that respect, the mining industry has been engaged in a dialog, now, for the better part of the last decade. There is obviously disagreement as to the specifics. I am hopeful, before my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas, retires from this body, that we can indeed have an agreement on these issues and produce a piece of legislation that all of us can embrace. 
Let me speak specifically to the provisions that are contained in the proposal of the Senator from Arkansas. He would, in effect, repeal the percentage depletion allowance as it has existed in the code, in one form or another, since 1913. A percentage depletion allowance is not, as the senior Senator from Arkansas suggests, a giveaway to the mining industry. Rather, it is a longstanding tax policy that recognizes the unique nature of the mining industry. 
Congress has long recognized that the principal capital asset of a mineral producer is its mineral reserves, the ore body itself. These mineral reserves are classified as wasting assets. As the minerals are produced or sold, the mineral deposit from which they are taken is gradually exhausted. Indeed, that is the history of every mining exploration in the history of my own State. These ore bodies are not inexhaustible; they last for a finite period of time, and the tax law reflects the reality of those circumstances. 
That was first recognized in 1913, when the Congress allowed a portion of the value of these assets or reserves to be deducted from taxable income to allow producers to replace that ore body, their wasting asset. So depletion is similar to the depreciation allowance for the use of physical properties. It is an allowance that allows an investor in natural resources to recover his capital outlay in the mineral through a depletion allowance to producers to simply level the playing field between those classes of taxpayers. So, although it is unique, its underlying premise, its principle is the same: to recognize that the asset is not inexhaustible, that it has a finite lifespan, and the Tax Code reflects that circumstance. 
The capital investment necessary for modern mining is astronomical. It is not unusual to anticipate capital expenditures that will exceed $1 billion when opening a new mine. So the notion that somehow this land is turned over and immediately the next day the entrant is able to extract a large body of ore and make fantastic profits with no outlay, either in terms of ultimate tax liability or expenditures, simply is divorced from reality. Many explorations prove unsuccessful; that is, the quality of the reserves are simply unsustainable in terms of their economic feasibility. And that is a reality. 
Many claims turn out to be unsuccessful because the mineral is not identified and cannot be located for purposes other than exploration. So the risks here in a mining operation are enormous. The Bumpers amendment would repeal the percentage depletion allowance for only those minerals obtained from land granted under the 1872 mining law. I think therein lies the true nature of the Bumpers amendment. This has little or nothing to do with tax reform. It seeks to punish the mining industry because Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on reforming the mining law of 1872. And that is patently unfair. 
We recognize that reform needs to occur. The dialog continues. As I have indicated, I am hopeful that in this Congress it will be possible for us to achieve an agreement with respect to that reform. 
Moreover, as the Senator from Alaska pointed out earlier, this industry is part, as other parts of our economy are, of a global competition. For us to remain competitive in America it will be very important for us not to impose a tax system that is viewed as so punitive as to discourage mineral exploration in its entirety. 
I speak with some personal knowledge of the situation because, in my own State, we have gone through a series of mining booms. The origin of Nevada's history--born, as it was, during the Civil War--is a result of the first great mineral discovery in our State, the Comstock Lode, in 1859. 
That discovery, which brought thousands of people into what is now Nevada, laid the predicate for Nevada's admission to statehood. The mining industry was such an important part of the early economy in Nevada that the first attempt at statehood failed because of the way the State Constitution, as then proposed, contemplated the imposition of the tax on mining. So our heritage is linked to this industry, and the taxable implications are something that all of us in Nevada are very mindful of. 
That mining boom lasted for a period of roughly 25 years. By the end of the century, the ore bodies having been depleted in the Comstock Lode, Nevada's mining industry was in a pronounced state of recession. It was resurrected ever so briefly during the period of World War I, and then declined at the end of that war. The modern period really began about 10 or 15 years ago, with the technology that makes it possible to recover microscopic particles of gold, so small, so minute that they are undetected by the human eye. 
So this is an industry which has had a series of cyclical ups and downs. The suggestion of recklessly imposing this new tax structure is something that apprehends great fear for all of us in Nevada because of the sensitive nature of the industry and its transitory nature, based upon market circumstances as well as the ability to continue to locate new bodies of ore. 
For Nevada and for America, it has been a good industry. It employs about 120,000 people in America. In my own State, it employs 15,000. And, as has been pointed out by the Senator from Alaska, if one looks at the pay scale of major industries in America, the average salary in mining is close to $46,000 a year, and in the context of the debate that we had earlier today about Medicare and Medicaid, and coverage of hospital and physician services, most mining companies provide a full range of insurance coverage for their employees and their dependents. So they have been good citizens with us in Nevada. And they have contributed immeasurably to the prosperity that we enjoy in Nevada. 
In point of fact, Nevada produces more in the way of gold than any other State in the country. Indeed, if we were a separate country, we would rank internationally somewhere among fourth, fifth and sixth in terms of production worldwide. So this is a major industry with enormous significance to my State, that pays good money to good people. We are not going to allow that industry to be devastated by an improvident, zealous attack on the industry and the failure to properly consider what the impact of this would be. 
Let me, by way of a concluding comment, indicate what kind of an administrative nightmare this provision would be. As I indicated a moment ago, this change would apply only with respect to those minerals that are recovered under public lands, under lands which were entered pursuant to the provision of the mining law of 1872. That suggests that a mining operation is finitely defined and that an operation that derives its origin from entry under the mining law of 1872 is a separate and distinct and discrete operation from that part of the operation in which the mining company may have acquired title to the property through private sale. 
Indeed, if you look at the mining operations that currently exist in my own State, and if you look at the source of title or occupancy of those lands, you will find as many as five or six different derivative sources for the occupation and/or title or patent to those claims. So it would be an administrative nightmare in allocating this new system of taxation to a single operator on a single mine who is mining bodies of ore through different areas within a fairly confined area of a few of those acres. So it is totally impractical. 
I hope my colleagues recognize that this is not the sort of thing we should do without giving due deliberation to the broader issue which will be discussed during this Congress and I hope will be resolved, and that is to deal with the update of the mining law of 1872. That is what this debate ought to be about, rather than a punitive approach which is taken in the proposed Bumpers amendment. 
I hope, at the appropriate time, my colleagues will join us in rejecting this proposal and allow us to continue the debate with respect to reform during the course of this Congress. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in observing the 30th anniversary of the reunification of the city of Jerusalem. Although the modern State of Israel was founded almost 50 years ago, in 1948, the city of Jerusalem was at that time still divided between Israel and Jordan, and its holy sites were not open to all religious groups. After Jerusalem became one again in 1967, these important historical and religious sites were opened to Christians, Jews, Muslims, and all others who wished to worship or simply spend some time in the Old City or at the Western Wall. 
I have long supported an undivided Jerusalem in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group will be protected and respected. Jerusalem is not only the capital of Israel, but also the home of more than 40 Christian denominations and the home of the Moslem religion. It is imperative that we work to preserve this city's unity and prevent any actions that would threaten this status. At the same time, we must ensure that our efforts to maintain unity in the holy city do not divide those working toward a lasting peace in the Middle East. Jerusalem is holy to many people in many different ways, and its future has understandably been a sensitive issue in the ongoing peace process. Unfortunately, some have used the issue of a unified Jerusalem to divide those who share in the city's heritage. Our support today for unity in Jerusalem does not in any way detract from our support for peace in the Middle East. The peace process, with our unqualified support, must move forward. 
In closing, Mr. President, I simply wish to restate my support for a unified Jerusalem that is open to all those who wish to visit its historical and spiritual sites. It is fitting that the Senate takes a moment to reflect upon the importance of Jerusalem as a symbol to people of diverse faiths and as a unified city open to all. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today Senator Bond, Senator Moseley-Braun, and I are introducing legislation to require stocks to be traded in a much more consumer-friendly fashion with the added benefit of saving investors billions of dollars. 
Mr. President, I send that legislation to the desk for its introduction. 
Let me just say parenthetically this is not the first time that I have had the privilege of working with the senior Senator from Missouri on legislation that affects vital consumer interests. He and I had the opportunity to work over several previous Congresses and secured in the last Congress significant changes to Federal law that protect consumers in terms of correcting information on their consumer histories, the largest single complaint before the Federal Trade Commission, and through his leadership and support and sustained efforts we were able to accomplish that. So I look forward to working with him on the piece of legislation that we introduce today, with the only caveat that I hope my distinguished colleague and I might be more helpful in getting this passed in a sooner period of time than we did on our previous enterprise which took three successive Congresses to work through. 
This legislation would bring to an end an antiquated pricing system currently used by Wall Street to buy and sell stocks that dates back to colonial times when the New York Stock Exchange was founded in the 18th century and the dollar was denominated in pieces of eight. While every other pricing system in our country has moved to dollars and cents, Wall Street continues to use this outdated eighths pricing system. 
As one article pointed out, and I quote, `Imagine going to the grocery store and seeing bacon selling for $3 3/8 and chicken potpies for $1 5/8 .' Mr. President, not only has every other pricing system in America moved to dollars and cents, but all other major stock exchanges in the world--all--have abandoned the antiquated eighths system and now trade in decimals. 
The bill that we are introducing today is a companion piece of legislation to H.R. 1053 sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Oxley, Markey and Bliley. This legislation would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to, within 1 year after the enactment of the legislation, adopt a rule to transition the stock and option markets away from their current trading practice in eighths to trading in dollars and cents. 
Currently, the New York Stock Exchange has a rule which mandates a minimum quote of an eighth for a share of stock trading in excess of $1. This rule is sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Otherwise, it would be a blatant example of price-fixing. This legislation would require the SEC to revise this sanction to better represent the interests of consumers and investors throughout the country. 
I must say, Mr. President, I have been encouraged by recent newspaper reports which suggest that the New York Stock Exchange plans to move to one-sixteenth of a dollar and in 2 years to switch to decimals. If those reports are in fact confirmed--and I am informed that there is a meeting today in which formal action will be taken to that effect--then the members of the New York Stock Exchange are to be commended for moving in the right direction. I would note, however, that there are other stock exchanges in the United States which have not yet indicated that is their course of action, and so this legislation will be necessary to ensure that all take that step. 
There are currently 60 million Americans who participate directly in the stock markets who would benefit from change. Large pension funds and small investors alike would benefit. According to SEC Commissioner Steven Wallman, investors would end up saving between $5 billion to $10 billion each year if stocks were traded in increments of dollars and cents rather than in the current practice of trading in eighths. It is not uncommon for a 500-million share day to occur on a given day, so a small change in the spread would mean enormous savings for investors. 
Many of us are reluctant to have Government intervene in the marketplace. Private sector determinations ought to be the rule, not the exception, here in America. In point of fact, we do not have a free market at work here. In fact, we have a classic example of price collusion. Wall Street dictates that this antiquated system be used and that all dealers must adhere to it. In essence, we are not interfering with the free market system; we are stepping in to help the stock market act more like a free market. 
We are not trying to dictate the spreads that could be charged in the buying and selling of stocks or the profits that Wall Street can make. In my judgment, that would be appropriate. If this legislation is enacted, however, stocks would be traded in dollars and cents and then the free market can more accurately determine what the prices and spreads should be. This is the essence of a free market. This is the essence of free enterprise. It seems appropriate as we move into the 21st century. It is time the United States joined the rest of the world in using a more rational, understandable system of stock transactions.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from Alaska for yielding me 3 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise today to stress the importance of passing this bill so that vital disaster relief assistance is made available to the hundreds of communities impacted by weather-related disasters. In Nevada, this flooding took place in early January, and the situation facing Nevada's farming and ranching communities gets more critical with each day that passes. 
The damage that occurred when the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers overflowed their banks devastated urban and rural areas alike in six counties in Nevada. Thousands of homes in Nevada were flooded, forcing families to move into emergency relief centers to wait for the floodwaters to recede. In the cities of Reno and Sparks, water flowed 10 feet above the banks of the Truckee River in the business district. Hundreds of businesses were forced to shut down, putting 20,000 people out of work. 
Much of this initial damage was addressed by the swift and able Federal emergency relief efforts. I was extremely pleased with the assistance provided by Federal and local workers, who put forth an incredible effort. As the emergency funds that supported these initial life-saving efforts have dried up, however, Nevada's rural communities in particular have been unable to begin repairs to riverbanks, levees, and flood control structures that are essential to their livelihoods. 
The damage to these areas was severe; after surveying flood damage from a helicopter with FEMA director James Lee Witt, I was struck by how much the normally rolling green hills of Mason Valley looked like a giant rice paddy in Southeast Asia. Dams were destroyed, rivers carved new paths through fields and pastures, and roads were washed out by the record flows on Nevada's rivers. 
The irrigation structures that divert water to ranches and farms in Northern Nevada were severely damaged or wiped out completely, leaving the farms near the riverbanks under water, while those farther away from the river were cut off completely. These families lost crops, livestock, all of the hay that normally would carry their cattle through the winter, and miles of fencing around their property. Some of those cut off from the rivers dug new ditches to bring water to their livestock at their own expense, while others have simply resigned themselves to the fact that they will not be able to survive this season, and may go out of business. You see, Mr. President, most of the farms and ranches that I am talking about are family-owned and managed, and are hard pressed to keep going without some immediate help. 
Mr. President, the circumstances in my own State and some other 30 States compel that we act immediately. It is for that reason I express my profound regret that some have found necessary to add political riders to this bill, riders that are totally unrelated and irrelevant to the issue at hand. 
I urge immediate action on this bill. Nevada's families deserve no less. 
I yield my time and thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for accommodating me.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, many of our senior citizens are once again being targeted by scam artists. This time, senior citizens are being charged excessive fees by so-called estate planners who provide information on reverse mortgages and charge 8 percent to 10 percent of the loan. 
More than 12 million elderly homeowners own their homes free and clear of mortgages. This implies the availability of a potentially large market for home equity conversion programs. Reverse mortgages, one of the hottest financial products of the 1990's for seniors, allow homeowners to tap into the equity in their homes and use that equity as a source of income. They work much like traditional mortgages, only in reverse. Rather than making a payment to your lender each month, the lender pays the homeowner. Depending on the loan, a reverse mortgage becomes due with interest when the homeowner moves, sells the property, or dies. 
The reverse mortgage program provides tens of thousands of older homeowners, who are `house-rich, but cash-poor,' the opportunity to turn their home equity into spendable cash to deal with major financial setbacks such as home repairs, significant health costs, or basic living needs. Reports of abusive practices should not diminish the value of this product. Rather, we must find a way to protect senior homeowners from scam artists who prey on the vulnerabilities of elderly Americans. 
Mr. President, senior citizens across the country are being charged scandalous fees for information that can be obtained free from HUD. According to HUD, many older Americans who sign contracts with estate planning services and are charged large fees are unaware that the same information is available from HUD at no cost. Generally, estate planners fees range from 6 to 10 percent of the loan amount. This translates into $3,000 to $5,000 for a $50,000 loan or $6,000 to $10,000 for a $100,000 loan. 
Pauline and Jim Mitchell both 79 years old from Henderson, NV were forced to spend most of their savings when Pauline's mother--who was stricken with Alzheimers--moved in with the Mitchells for 7 years before she passed away last year. When the Mitchells were approached by a door-to-door salesman about obtaining a reverse mortgage to pay off expenses, they were extremely interested. What they did not know, however, was that it would cost them $4,500. It was not until they received their lump sum check of $31,000, did they realize that $4,500 had been taken out--in addition to the normal closing costs. That represents a 12 percent commission above and beyond closing costs--for a service they could get for free if they had contacted HUD or the lender directly. At most, they should have been charged a few hundred dollars referral fee--not $4,500. 
Mickey Kimberlin and her husband James from Las Vegas were charged $4,000 for information about a reverse mortgage. The Kimberlins were interested in obtaining a reverse mortgage to help pay for mounting family medical bills. When they were contacted by a representative of America's Trust Inc. of San Juan Capistrano in California, they did not realize they would be charged 8.5 percent of the loan. 
The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act will protect senior citizens receiving a HUD home equity conversion mortgage from further exploitation by these predator lenders. Our legislation will no longer allow scam artists to hide outrageous reverse mortgage fees. Full disclosure of the costs and the ability of HUD to prevent excessive fees are important and necessary steps to take to protect senior citizens seeking reverse mortgages. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation to protect our Nation's senior citizens.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, what the Senate is asked to do this morning is a total repudiation and rejection of good science. S. 104 is opposed by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a body of eminent scientists, created pursuant to an act of Congress. They reviewed it last year in 1996 and last year. They say two things. First, it is unnecessary. Second, it interferes with the citing process, which is currently taking place. We dismantle the environmental laws in America if we enact this legislation. 
In 1992, the Energy Efficiency Act directed the National Academy of Sciences in conjunction with EPA to develop a standard. They are about ready to do that. This legislation rejects that standard and proposes a limitation on the ability of the National Academy of Sciences and the EPA to develop the standard that would provide minimal protections for health and safety. 
The third point that needs to be made is that the Nevada test site is frequently referenced. That is the proposed site for the alternative storage, the interim storage. No study has ever been made that would indicate that the Nevada test site is either desirable or suitable as an interim storage facility. 
The fourth point I make is that this legislation, in fact, preempts laws in my own State, unlike it does any other State in America. The environmental protection laws are essentially delegated to the States with their ability to enforce. This legislation would preempt that ability. So in Nevada we could not enforce clean air, clean water, safe drinking, RCRA, and other provisions. 
The fifth point is that the National Environmental Policy Act is gutted by the provisions. It is bad legislation. I urge my colleagues to reject it, and I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. President, I say to the chairman, the floor manager, we have had a spirited and prolonged debate. That is in the best tradition of the Senate. I thank him for his personal courtesies in terms of procedure in the Chamber so that we were given an opportunity to fully express and develop our views. 
Let me say to my colleagues who voted against this bill, I know that for a number of them it was particularly difficult. That vote was in the interest of good science. I appreciate their courage. I appreciate their support. Senator Rockefeller could not be here this morning because he has another matter. We appreciate his support, and he reaffirmed his support to us in a message earlier today. Several of my colleagues indicated they would be with us to support us on the veto override if it reaches that point. So I think what we have done is to allow science and logic to proceed in the development of what is a responsible nuclear waste policy rather than to respond to the emotions of the occasion. I appreciate very much my colleagues who stayed with us on this important issue and the floor leader and the chairman for his courtesies in permitting us to proceed in an orderly fashion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I perhaps will not require all the time. 
I do not, Mr. President, want to take much time to talk about the merits of S. 104 because, as we will point out later, S. 104 is a very bad piece of legislation and, in my view, is a policy disaster. It is unnecessary. There are provisions that would preempt Federal and State law, standards, viability, transportation--there are many, many things that could be said about the legislation, and I will address each of those arguments with some particularity. 
I must say that I am constrained to address the issue of the lawsuit, because we hear a lot about the lawsuit. The lawsuit was decided before our votes were cast last year on S. 1936, but I think it is curious and revealing, revealing as to the true motives of this bill. Nothing in S. 104 deals with the lawsuits. 
This Senator believes that ratepayers who are in a position where they may incur additional expense for storage because of the unavailability of a permanent repository in 1998 are entitled to relief. I do not think ratepayers ought to pay twice. I have introduced legislation each year that I have been a Member of Congress to express that view. It is curious, Mr. President, the utilities who drive the policy in this--this is the nuclear utilities bill--do not want to talk about that. As recently as a couple of weeks ago, the Secretary of the Department of Energy acknowledged that the Department wanted to talk about compensation to utilities who will incur additional expense because they will be storing beyond what was contemplated in 1982 as a 1998 acceptance date. So this legislation does nothing with respect to compensation or to provide relief for ratepayers, and the fact that it does not makes the motive so abundantly clear. This is all about getting the waste out to Nevada, irrespective of environmental or other policy considerations. 
Let me talk, if I may, very briefly, about the substitute as it deals with the mill tax levy. Current law provides that the utilities must pay into the nuclear waste trust fund on the basis of 1 mill per kilowatt hour of nuclear power generated. It goes into a trust fund. That is paid only so long as that utility generates nuclear power. 
If you look at this line, Mr. President, the mill fee payment line, you will notice it rapidly declines between now and the year 2033, and the reason for that is because every currently licensed nuclear reactor in America will be closed by 2033. Their license period will expire. So with each closure of a reactor, less is being paid into the fund. 
The obligation, however, in terms of dealing with the issue of nuclear waste goes out to the year 2071, so that you can see that there is another 38 years beyond 2033 that there is a responsibility to make payments dealing with the waste, and there will be no money coming in. 
Currently, the Department estimates that the nuclear waste trust fund is underfunded between $4 billion and $8 billion currently. If it is underfunded, I respectfully submit that you do not need a degree from the Wharton School of Finance to know who is going to make up the shortfall. It is the American taxpayers who are going to make it up. So the current law says with respect to the mill levy and how much it will be, is that the Secretary will make a recommendation when it needs to be adjusted, and unless the Congress or one House rejects that recommendation, that will go into effect. It was a law not written by the Nevada delegation. It dates back to the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act. 
Here is what is done to change all of that. In the original substitute, we changed the burden so that now any change to increase the rate of mill-tax collection, rather than being enacted unless there is a rejection by one House, it requires an affirmative burden to pass both Houses of Congress. 
As the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows, based upon his considerable legislative experience, it is far more difficult to pass a piece of legislation than to object to it. 
So that is the nub of this. It will be virtually impossible if the utilities object to an increase in the mill levy to get that on because it will require both Houses of Congress to affirmatively act on a resolution. 
In the substitute that was offered by the able chairman of the Energy Committee, all budget points of order were waived. So the Senator from New Mexico, and appropriately so, sought an amendment in the first degree to restore a budget point of order, and I have no quarrel with that. 
The second degree, in effect, provides that still both Houses must approve any increase, and so, in my judgment, this is a provision that is designed to provide relief for the utilities to leave the nuclear waste fund underfunded by billions and billions of dollars, and long after any Member who currently serves in this body or the other body leaves, the American taxpayer is going to get the short end of the stick. 
Let me say, Mr. President, that no one would disagree if they are honest with their original position that it was understood that the nuclear utilities would undertake an expense of all of the cost of nuclear waste disposal. That was an obligation they agreed to do and that is why the mill tax on each kilowatt hour was imposed, that is why the nuclear waste trust fund. But through this substitute, we have a situation that will exacerbate the shortfall. It is said there is $8 billion in the trust fund, but, Mr. President, from 2033 until 2071, nothing comes into the trust fund because all of the reactors that are currently licensed are shut down. That is the buildup, and that is what this yellow line indicates, because it begins to build up and it, too, declines as the expenses are incurred and the revenues into the fund decrease. 
So this is a bad, bad amendment, and I urge that it be rejected. I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am sure that most of my colleagues who have watched this debate for the last week are of the opinion that after some 5 days of debate that everything that can ultimately be said about this legislation has been said, and I hate to disabuse them of the notion but my colleague from Nevada and I are going to beg their indulgence and talk a little bit more about the substitute that has been offered by the Senator from Alaska. 
It is my firm conviction that the belief of the scientific community is that this legislation for interim storage is unnecessary. That is the conclusion advanced by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We have talked about that a great deal. But the reason this is important is that this is the scientific community. This is not the Senator from Nevada debating with our friends from Alaska, Idaho, or any other State delegation. Not a single member of this Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board is a Nevadan. That is their position; that it is a fundamental flaw in this legislation. It is not necessary. It is not being requested by the scientific community. It is not being supported by the scientific community, and quite to the contrary. The 1996 report says that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was reconstituted with new members in 1997, a new chairman, and a number of new members. And they reaffirmed the position of the technical review board a year ago in concluding that it is not necessary. It is not necessary. So it is premature. It is unwise. It is the worst of policy. 
I only wish I were capable, Mr. President, of articulating with more insight, more capacity, and with more persuasive force because it has been said here on the floor of the Senate over and over again that the Nevada test site is the preferred alternative. Mr. President, there is not one scintilla of evidence to suggest that. 
Yucca Mountain is being characterized or studied for the permanent repository. But there has been no scientific evaluation or judgment made that the Nevada test site is a preferred alternative--none--because under the current law an interim storage facility cannot be established in Nevada, nor the State of the distinguished occupant of the chair, nor any other State until application is made for licensure under the permanent site. 
So there has been no search in a scientific sense to have a determination made as to an interim site. So anyone who thinks that this is the product of analytical scientific reasoning needs to be aware of the fact that there has been no study, no evaluation, no scientific analysis, nothing--absolutely nothing--that suggests that the Nevada test site is a preferred alternative or a desired alternative; absolutely not because the focus in terms of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is the permanent geological storage. And Yucca Mountain, much to my dismay--I don't like this fact--but Yucca Mountain is being studied or characterized. And that is where the focus has been in terms of scientific study and analysis. 
So I think it is important to make that clear distinction. It has been said that the Nevada test site has been used for previous testing programs. That is true. But that is not to suggest that makes it a preferred or a better site than any one of a number of other possibilities around the country. I think we need to try to drive that point home to my colleagues who are studying this issue and who are trying to make some rational judgments based upon the debate we have had over the last 5 days. 
The substitute: It has been said that it is a better piece of legislation than the one last year. 
I suppose if a terminally ill man is told that he has 6 months to live rather than 3 months to live, that is better news, but it is still not a desirable result and certainly something that would cause little rejoicing. 
This is a bad piece of legislation because it destroys a carefully crafted, carefully constructed environmental protection legislative framework that has served America under both Republican and Democratic Presidents exceedingly well for the last 28 years or so. 
It has been said by our friends who are arguing for this that we have taken care of the problem of preemption. Those who followed the debate in the last Congress will recall that preemption was at the heart of the issue, and it continues to remain so. 
Here is what the law says. Let me just say that the nuclear utility lawyers ought to get an A-plus for being clever and disingenuous, because this is an exceedingly skillful bit of legalistic drafting that produces a consequence that I think no fair-minded person could conclude. The substitute says that except as provided in a couple sections a law, regulation, order, or other requirement of a State, political subdivision of a State, or Indian tribe is preempted. 
So the argument that is made in the Chamber is that we are only preempting State law. Not true, not true, not true, because under the legislative system we have established for the environmental acts that have been passed over the last nearly three decades, Federal legislation is enacted whether we are talking about safe drinking water, clean air, clean water, RCRA, in which the States are delegated the ability to enforce if they enact legislation that is equal to or greater than the Federal legislation. 
It has been suggested the language that is used now in the new section 501, found on page 59, of S. 104, the substitute, is just what we have in HAZMAT. Not true, Mr. President, not true, not true. HAZMAT has a provision that says except as provided in the appropriate subsections unless authorized by another law of the United States, a requirement of a State, political subdivision of a State, or an Indian tribe is preempted. The operative language `unless authorized by another law of the U.S.' It is not by omission, inadvertence or happenstance that operative language `unless authorized by the U.S.' has been dropped, because it is that provision of law in the HAZMAT code that says `unless authorized by another law of the U.S.' that enables a State statute responding to the delegation of authority given to it under Federal environmental law, that those State laws are protected because they are authorized by Federal law. 
So here is what we have. Let us forget for a moment what kind of passion one might have for nuclear waste and a sense, yes, gosh, it ought to be sent somewhere. But let us just talk about policy. If this legislation passes, Nevada will be the only State in the Union that will be unable to enforce a State law enacted pursuant to an environmental delegation of authority. 
Now, what conceivable rationale could possibly lead to that conclusion? It is very clear that this is nothing less than a preemption, and so we are talking about safe drinking water, clean air, clean water, RCRA, much as we did in the last session of the Congress when this was debated. 
Another provision is kind of interesting as well if HAZMAT be the standard. Under HAZMAT, a State has the ability to make application for a waiver to that preemption of a State law--a law that would not be enacted pursuant to the delegation of Federal authority under our environmental law--but let's just say another provision of State law. A State would have the ability to seek a waiver and a judgment would be made as to whether or not a waiver should be granted. 
That provision is not included, not included, not included in S. 104. Furthermore, under the waiver provision, if a State is denied a waiver provision under the HAZMAT legislation, which is again asserted by the supporters of S. 104, S. 104 is virtually--and we will come back to the word `virtually' in a moment--identical to HAZMAT. We already have it. No reason to be concerned. This is something that we have established, a precedent. The policy is there. We are just simply asking you to do no more in S. 104 than we have all agreed to be done in HAZMAT. 
Not true, Mr. President, not true, not true, because in HAZMAT a State that makes an application for a waiver, that provision that is not available under S. 104, also has the ability for judicial review, to have the denial reviewed in a court of law consistent with the Administrative Procedures Act that exists at the Federal level and State level. But under S. 104 there is no mechanism provided for judicial review.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague for his extraordinary review of this piece of legislation, in pointing out its pitfalls. We are concluding a week's debate on this, Mr. President. I want to make just a couple of more points, and then tomorrow we will have a vote and we will either do the right thing, or we will impose upon the American public a terrible public policy consequence. 
Mr. President, I have reviewed in an earlier part of my statement the various provisions in this bill, which, in my view, represent the most atrocious policy options that one could conjure up. As my senior colleague mentioned, who would you trust and rely upon to give you advice on an issue that, obviously, is very technical, very complicated? For those of us who do not deal with these kinds of issues every day, this is not something that is intuitive judgment. 
I want to return to the starting point for just a moment to talk about this being unnecessary legislation--unnecessary in that the policy and the scientific community disagree with its very premise. Now, when you look at the various groups that are playing a role in this debate, one thing stands out: The only people that are advocating this legislation are the nuclear utilities and their supporters. It is not the environmental community. 
My colleague recited that every major organization in America that has an environmental constituency has opposed this legislation, and for good reason. It is not the scientific community. We frequently hear science invoked as the governing beacon that ought to guide us in this policy debate. If that were true, there would not be a single vote for S. 104, because the scientific community is not urging us to enact this legislation. This is legislation that has been generated, fomented by the nuclear utility industry and is part of the history that we have faced in America in dealing with this very complicated, troublesome, and very, very dangerous electrical generation source. 
More than 15 years ago, we were confronted with policy debates that sound very much like those on the floor today, in which the utilities said that we are going to be without energy, we will have brownouts, and the utilities will be forced to close because they will run out of reactor space. This was all generating hysteria. It was not true then and it is not true now. But that has been the legacy that we have in this debate, in trying to make our way through the very sound judgments that ought to control our decisionmaking process in reaching the proper conclusion. 
So, essentially, you have the policymakers, the scientific community, the President of the United States all saying, look, this is unnecessary. They are allied against the utilities who have made this argument, as I say, for several decades. It has been said that this is a better piece of legislation. I think that is very questionable, Mr. President. When one looks at what is done, we wreak havoc upon the environmental legislation in America. Only by the most tortured and twisted and convoluted logic could S. 104 be considered sound environmental policy. 
The preemption provisions, which I have discussed at some length, deprive a State of its ability to enforce environmental laws by the Federal Government. It eliminates waiver provisions that are part and parcel of our environmental legislation that provides judicial review. We talked about what is done to 
standards. Those have greatly been diminished. We are talking about something, Mr. President, that isn't just temporarily inconvenient or needs to be cleaned up because it would be a nuisance in the community. We are talking about something that is lethal, deadly, for 10,000 years and beyond. That is beyond the period of recorded history. We have never dealt with that kind of a policy issue. I can understand the frustration that some of my colleagues experience, that it may be another 4, 5, 6 years before this determination or that. But when you are talking about 10,000 years, and beyond, 4 or 5 years more to get it right, to do the right thing, to protect the health and safety of the American public seems rather little to ask when you are dealing with something as dangerous as this. 
We have talked about the flaw in the viability assessment of the President of the United States. He has to make his assessment based on a standard that is not going to exist. Charitably, it would have to be a guess. How can one make a sound policy judgment based upon a standard that is yet to be developed and is nonexistent? Whatever one thinks about the politics of this administration, one would have to conclude that it is the ultimate irresponsibility to ask any Chief Executive to make a judgment based upon his or her assessment, when the standard upon which the benchmarks are to be measured don't exist. 
My colleague talked at great length about the transportation dangers. I understand that we all in this Chamber are candidates who have faced the people in our States respectively. I understand that the utilities in a number of States have leaned very heavily and have been to the offices and advocated and raised all kinds of specters. Let me just suggest for a moment that what is happening in California as we speak, I think, is very instructive. There, as many of you may be aware, nuclear waste is going to be shipped from the Pacific in the Concorde and then transported over the Sierra Nevada from California into Nevada and, ultimately, to be stored in Idaho. If you think that the pressures that the utilities have brought to bear are heavy, when the first series of 17,000 shipments of high-level waste traversing the highways and rail systems of 43 States, in which 51 million people live within 1 mile or less--when that begins to occur, much as my senior colleague has pointed out with graphic detail about what has occurred fairly recently in Germany, that is going to be a real constituent concern, and rightly so, because an accident can have a devastating impact upon the health of that community. 
So this is not just a Nevada issue. This is an issue which will affect many millions of people in this country. We have talked about the lawsuit, how there is this great empathy and understanding about the ratepayers and the consequences for them, how they paid $8 billion over the years into the nuclear waste trust fund. Nothing in this legislation provides 1 cent of relief for the ratepayers. That, to me, is the true indicator of what this is all about. This isn't trying to provide equity for the ratepayers. This is not trying to provide or prevent ratepayers from paying twice for something that they have already paid once for. It has nothing to do with that, or you would see relief in S. 104. There is nothing. Nothing provides any relief for a lawsuit. The lawsuit remedy, as I have indicated, under section 9 of the contract, provides for an equitable adjustment of payments made into the nuclear waste fund. I think that is fine. But nothing in this legislation deals with the ratepayers, because nothing is contained that provides any kind of equitable relief for the ratepayers. 
Finally, let me talk about one other section of this legislation, which I think, again, would indicate how corrupting it is in terms of doing great violence to the environmental laws of America, laws that have, by and large, survived the test of time for nearly three decades and have enjoyed bipartisan support. It was during the Nixon administration that most of these pieces of legislation first saw the light of day. 
I want to talk about the National Environmental Policy Act, as 
it is referred to as NEPA. We are told in one instance that NEPA must be followed. It sounds good, doesn't it? But then we are told that the following activities will be deemed preliminary activities. That just might seem like words--`preliminary.' That is a very precise term because preliminary activities are not subject to judicial review. And in most instances, the courts themselves make a judgment as to whether something is deemed preliminary or final for the purposes of review. But just as a further indication of how this stacks the deck against anything that provides environmental protection, you have a whole series of actions at page 90 under this act--transportation requirements; viability assessment, and that is section 204; 205(a) is generic design, submitted for interim storage; 205 is site-specific design standards; 205 is license application for interim storage; 206 is repository characterizations. Each of those sections are deemed to be preliminary, so as to preclude the opportunity for independent judgment as to whether or not they do, in fact, comply with the law and make good sense. So, in effect, what we do in those sections, if 104 passes, we gut NEPA, eviscerate it. We proclaim our great devotion to it in the first section, but then say that it shall not include the following. 
Let me further go on to indicate that the essence of NEPA is to consider the various options or choices that are available. That is the underlying premise, the theory being that if you look at all of the options on the table, we will rule out, through some rational, thoughtful process, those that are the least compelling from a policy point of view and reach a conclusion as to the best of the options available. But we are told here, with respect to the environmental impact statement, that is part of the NEPA requirement, that this commission shall not be required to consider the need for an interim storage facility, the time of initial availability of a repository or interim storage facility, the alternatives to geological disposal or centralized interim storage or alternatives to the interim storage facility site. So to profess that we do give any kind of meaningful adherence to the National Environmental Policy Act--NEPA--is itself a travesty. 
Finally, let me say that when the vote comes tomorrow, I hope that my colleagues, putting aside all of the technical arguments for a moment, might consider policy. What is the right policy for America? What protects public health and safety? What is the most thoughtful way to proceed? Mr. President, the most thoughtful way to proceed is to reject S. 104. It has been asserted that we have no policy with respect to the disposal of nuclear waste. That is simply not true. The policy that we have was essentially designed in 1982 with the enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, and that policy first is to site permanent repository. I am not ecstatic about, I do not like it, and I wish it were not the case that Yucca Mountain in my own State was chosen. 
But that is a policy that came down as a result of the things that were done and I believe were highly politicized in terms of the way it was done. But nevertheless that is where we are. Yucca Mountain is being characterized as an interim storage. This legislation would change the existing law, which says that we ought to seek first if a permanent repository can pass muster, is it suitable, before making a determination as to interim storage. This legislation reverses that process and says, in effect, that we will make decisions with respect to interim storage irrespective of what happens with respect to the permanent repository. That makes no sense at all. 
Finally, I think, just as an admonition, that this has been a very difficult time for Nevada. I believe that it is without precedent in the years that I have been a Member of this body that a State has been so imposed upon, so unconsidered, so rejected of a rational policy argument to acquiesce to the requests of a special interest group--the nuclear utilities in America. 
But let me say that if we pass S. 104, what a dreadful precedent that may be. No other State can be heard to say thereafter, `Gee, this is terrible policy for us as it affects my State.' In effect, we establish a precedent in which a State's rights are imposed upon in which the State's ability to protect its own citizens' health and safety by way of Federal environmental standards being limited, and in which those very basic provisions of the ability to review and get judicial determination before something as horrendous as this is imposed upon a State, are for all intents and purposes emasculated. That is the dreadful policy, and we will rue the day that occurs. 
So I urge my colleagues to reject S. 104. Let's stay the course. It may not be perfect in every respect, but at least we are moving on a basis of permanent repository in a rational context without getting involved in the emotionalism that has been present with respect to this frantic effort to have interim storage placed at the Nevada test site, a site, as we pointed out, which has not been recommended as a site to be preferred. Never, to the best of my knowledge, has it ever been studied for interim storage, and it was kind of picked out of the air. `You have Yucca Mountain over there, and Yucca Mountain may take it. So let's put it here.' That is not a very rational basis to make a policy judgment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me add, if I may, the significance I find in this piece of legislation that we are offering today. This has for too long a time been characterized strictly as a Nevada issue, and many of my colleagues have, obviously, focused less time on this than my senior colleague and I, because Nevada is targeted as the interim storage facility in this piece of legislation. But the point that we have sought to make is that there is a national impact in the transportation of 85,000 metric tons--that is the emphasis, 85,000 metric tons--of nuclear waste in an order of magnitude never before seen. There have been over the years 2,500 shipments, but we are talking about 17,000, and as the Presiding Officer may recall from our debate earlier on this, those earlier 2,500 shipments involved a relatively short distance of about 900 miles or less. 
By reason of the proximity of the Nevada test site, as contrasted from the origin of the nuclear waste itself at the reactors, we are talking about thousands of miles. I think my colleagues will recall that we are talking about rail and highway corridors that go through 43 States. Forty-three States are involved. So it is not just Nevada. Forty-three States. 
To give you some idea of the size of each cask, although they have not yet been designed, what is contemplated is that a rail cask would weigh 125 tons and a truck cask would weigh 25 tons. You will recall that, in terms of the level of potential radioactivity, that is the equivalent of 200 bombs the size of Hiroshima. So many may wonder why we are suggesting that we do this with respect to high-level nuclear waste shipments. It is because the order of risk is so much greater and the consequences of failing to provide for it is much, much greater. 
The Presiding Officer represents the great State of Oklahoma. You will note that in Oklahoma, we have at least three different corridors that would be used. These are all rail corridors that would come through the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. What we are simply saying is, `Look, can a Governor have a greater responsibility and obligation to the citizens of the State that he or she 
represents than to make sure that adequate measures are taken to protect the health and safety of the citizens of that State?' 
Mr. President, as you know, I was honored by the citizens of my own State to have been elected Governor twice. I have some idea of the responsibilities that a Governor undertakes, and there can be no greater responsibility than a Governor advocating on behalf of the people he represents to make sure that any actions that are within his or her power are done for the purpose of protecting the health and safety of the citizens. 
So that is what we are doing. Not only is the Presiding Officer's State involved, we have Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, Utah, California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia--we can go on and on and on--Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, to go on and on. My point is that each of these Governors should have the ability to make sure adequate safeguards are taken. 
Let me just say, because this is an issue that has occurred out in the West and may not be widely publicized and it came to a boiling point during the recess, there is a series of shipments which are being received on the west coast from overseas nuclear reactors. They would come in through the Port of Oakland in California, ultimately to be located at the facility in Idaho. California's Governor complained vociferously that there had not been adequate notice, not adequate safeguards taken, and so he has filed, on behalf of the people of California, a lawsuit, or has directed the attorney general to do so, to challenge the adequacy of some of those provisions. My senior colleague, Senator Reid, pointed out the problems that have occurred in Europe. So these are not theoretical or hypothetical, these are real-life circumstances, and Governors ought to have the ability to do that. 
All we are saying is, look, each Governor must be satisfied that before a shipment goes through his or her State that safeguards are needed to protect the citizens of that State in literally hundreds of thousands of cities that this nuclear waste would go through. That strikes me as not being unreasonable. 
We talk a lot in this Congress of returning power to the States, not assuming all wisdom resides on the banks of the Potomac. Indeed, those who work in the Federal bureaucracy are vested with no greater wisdom than those who toil on behalf of a State government at the State level. I hear that time after time in many different contexts as we debate legislation on the floor. 
There is no greater opportunity that a Member can have than to say, in effect, `I am implementing a policy that provides to each of the States that which I have philosophically espoused, namely, giving the Governor, as the chief executive officer of that State, the ability to undertake the necessary protections.' I think that is a reasonable approach. I think it is something that every Governor would want. It is not partisan. Democratic Governors and Republican Governors alike would certainly want to be protected in terms of the 17,000 shipments that would pass through their States, through thousands of cities in America, small communities, and that is not unreasonable. 
And because these routes are identified here, as we are pointing them out--there is no great mystery--so that the State Governors could be contacted long in advance of any proposed shipment to work out the necessary health and safety precautions. 
I say to my colleagues that, however they come down on S. 104, this certainly is a measure that everybody ought to embrace because this is health and safety and it provides the ultimate protection for a Governor to take care of those persons in his or her State to the best of that Governor's ability. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I appreciate that. The Senator has been very fair, in terms of affording us the opportunity to do what is permitted under the rules. Perhaps what may have occurred is that we were asked by our staff to be given adequate time before a vote was taken, and someone said 11 o'clock would be that adequate time. That may have been misconstrued, I say to my friend. As to an agreement for a time certain for the vote, that was not my intention, and I accept what the chairman said. 
Let me make a couple of points, if I may. One is that this amendment applies only to the shipment of waste to the interim facility. So we are not talking about the ultimate shipment that may go to a permanent repository if indeed that repository would be found acceptable. I know the distinguished occupant of the chair, in his own legal background, would appreciate that what we are trying to say to his State and to every other State--Alabama has a great many routes that are going to be major corridors for the transshipment of nuclear waste. Most of 
those appear on this map to be hideaway corridors. I confess not knowing the State as he does, but there are at least four different corridors that would be involved, as I see it, by rail. That is the blue line. Much of that would come from Florida and Georgia, it would appear. Some would come from Tennessee, perhaps, I don't know. Then there is a major highway that appears to come across the top of his State. So what it would simply say is that the Governor of Alabama, before shipments would cross his State, would say, `Look, I want to have the opportunity to review and look and see if indeed all of the safety precautions are there.' Then if the Alabama Governor said he was satisfied, no problem, that's fine. We are trying to provide States with the opportunity to defend and protect themselves. 
The basic premise, Mr. President, is that we ought not to be moving this stuff all over the country, back and forth. Somehow there has been this fallacious assumption that there has been a determination that the Nevada test site is preeminently qualified to serve as an interim storage facility. That simply is not true. There has never been a study that reaches such a conclusion. There are probably a thousand places in the country that would be acceptable for interim storage. The only reason the Nevada test site has been chosen is the premise that the permanent repository at Yucca Mountain will meet the test. That is what this debate is about. We will talk much more about that in a different context. 
I want to, also, if I may, set the record straight. The Chicago editorial that the distinguished chairman read is absolutely replete with misinformation and errors. As the chairman read the article and indicated that 14 years ago it was determined that Nevada was the site, Mr. President, that is simply not true. Fourteen years ago, I believe the Congress attempted to pass a reasonable and balanced piece of legislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982--which was signed into law by then President Reagan in the early part of 1983. What it said was that we will look across the country and try to find the best sites. We will look at formations that consist of granite; we will look at the salt domes; we will look at welded tuft, which is what we have in Nevada. No region in the country will have to bear it all. There will be a balance. And, indeed, three sites would ultimately be submitted to the President of the United States after the study--three sites--and the President would select among those three sites. 
Now, that made some sense, in terms of the scientific approach and, indeed, I think that most people in my own State, as well as across the country, to the extent that they followed this, said that was balanced. 
Here is what happened. No sooner was the ink dry than the Presidential campaign of 1984 began to heat up and the President was telling people in the Southeast, `Don't worry, it is not going to be salt domes.' Then the Department of Energy said, `Well, my gosh, locating something in the East is going to create a lot of political pressure for us, so we will abandon that site.' Then, in 1987 came the ultimate rejection and repudiation of anything that purported to have any kind of scientific basis at all; it is a bill that is known in infamy in Nevada as the `screw Nevada' bill. It said, without so much as a scintilla of science, that we will only look at Nevada. That wasn't what the law said in 1984. It said we would look at three, we would look all over the country. Maybe Nevada would be the short straw. We would not like that. I am sure the occupant of the chair would not like it if it were Alabama. I understand that. 
Now, somehow the editorial suggested that the President entered into a crass political quid pro quo with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Nevada, with me and the Governor, and said, `Look, if you support my reelection that had absolutely nothing to do with it.' We made our argument based on merit--that is, that there should not be a shipment of interim waste to an interim storage facility until such determination of a permanent facility could actually be characterized. That was the whole scientific predicate. The President of the United States, in reaching his conclusion, followed the recommendations and conclusion of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, a body constituted by this Congress, which said there is absolutely no need to have an interim storage facility at this point.

Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely. If you are looking at this in terms of the political consequences, there are four electoral votes in Nevada. Many States have many more. So if it was a political calculus made, the President's math was poor indeed. He supported the position argued by not only those of us in Nevada, but those who were following the premise of the act, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the point made by the 
Senator from Arkansas the other day that we ought not to be transporting this across the country until we have the permanent site. Does it make any sense at all? I believe that was the basis.

Mr. BRYAN. The present state of the law, enacted by the Congress, prohibits a State that is being considered for a permanent facility to be the site of an interim or temporary facility. Moreover, at the request, as I recall it, of the Tennessee delegation some years ago, it prohibits the location of an interim facility until an application for licensure is made for the permanent facility. Now, that was sound policy. No. 1, no State, frankly, should have to bear the burden of both. That was the philosophy and the remnant of what was a fair act in the beginning--to look all over the country. The interim ought not to be located before the permanent, because we know that kind of tends to be de facto permanent. That was good policy, I say in answer to my friend.

Mr. BRYAN. It is indeed. This I would say to my friend from Nevada is a litmus test of whether we just talk the talk or walk the walk. This is all about States rights. I cannot conceive of any attorney general or any Governor in America who would not want the ability to provide for the protection of his or her State by simply saying, `Look, before we ship this 25-ton cask that someday will be provided by rail'--the 25-ton casks that are going to be mounted on some type of highway transport with the equivalency of 200 Hiroshimas in terms of its radioactive potential--I would think that any Governor, or any attorney general who has taken the same kind of oath of office that I and others have taken, would say, `Look. I would like the ability to provide that protection. I would like to see what it is that is coming.' 
I say in response to my friend's question about the protections that are purportedly built into this S. 104 that deals with transportation issues that it seems to me this is a logical extension of that.

Mr. BRYAN. Absolutely. Indeed, I would go further. It seems to me that it would be incumbent upon the department that wants to shift this, talking about 835,000 metric tons--we are talking about 17,000 shipments over a period of a number of decades--it would seem to me that the department would have the burden of going to Governors who have concerns, talk with them, and to say, `Look. This is what we are doing. This is how we propose to protect the shipment route to go through your State.' That seems to me to be a reasonable basis. 
I know that there are others who want to take the floor and will have a chance to discuss this some more. But I would like to conclude by saying that this is something that gives every Governor an opportunity to protect his or her citizens. And I say with some measure of envy that the Senator from Alaska can speak with a far greater degree I suppose of comfort level because whatever occurs or does not occur in this body, his State is thousands of miles from the field of action. I wish I were so fortunate. But it becomes my responsibility representing the people of Nevada who I represent, and who are my primary responsibility, to make sure that we provide all of the protections that can possibly be secured for their health and safety. And I will continue to do so. 
This is an offer by my colleague from Nevada and I to try to provide a safe piece of legislation, if indeed this is to be enacted into law. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. We have heard considerable debate in the Chamber here about the horrendous liability that may exist out there because everyone concedes that the Department would not be able to physically accept possession of the waste in 1998. I thought I understood the Senator to indicate that there is at least some measure of damages provided. We have heard all kinds of billions and billions of dollars. I wasn't sure that I heard the Senator's comments.

Mr. BRYAN. By contract. And there are provisions, if I understand it, that specifically relate to the scenario that is going to occur, namely, that nuclear waste, its physical possession cannot be accepted in 1998, and there are specific provisions in that contract, if I understand correctly.

Mr. BRYAN. So the argument that we have heard in the Chamber that ratepayers will pay twice is specious, because to the extent that after 1998 nuclear waste would not be taken physically from a site, it cannot be under any scenario, the ratepayers would then be protected because any additional costs that the utilities would incur would be deducted from the payments that the utilities would have to make into the nuclear waste trust fund, so there would be no double payment.

Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I appreciate that, and I will be brief. I want to respond to the comments about the resolution adopted by the Nevada Legislature in 1975. I think we have to put things in context. In 1951, we were assured that the detonation of nuclear bombs in the air 60 miles from Las Vegas was a very safe thing to do; you can rely upon us; you can trust us; we will never do anything. The scientific community embraced that, or at least we were told that at the time, and Nevadans agreed to do that. No scientist in the world would suggest to any community that to detonate a nuclear bomb within 60 miles of a metropolitan area is absolutely safe, and, in point of fact, we entered into an atmospheric nuclear test ban in 1963. 
If Nevadans can be faulted, they can be faulted because they relied upon representations of their Government which they believed to be true. We were all in America less sophisticated about the risk inherent in detonating bombs in the air. 
So, too, it was in 1975. If Nevadans can be faulted, we were less sophisticated. But I point out to the chairman and others that the world is dramatically different today than it was in 1975, and we know a lot more about the risks. 
Prior to 1979, I am sure that it would have been asserted not a chance in the world that any of the reactors in America would ever have a problem; we have the most preeminent, highly qualified, most sophisticated people in the world. Nobody today believes that to be categorically true. Three Mile Island occurred, and our naivete about the risks of nuclear power have been irreparably shattered, and nobody accepts those representations today. 
Before the worldwide devastating impact in Chernobyl, I am sure everybody was assured there was no problem with any of these reactors, there was no risk, no danger. My point is that we are all more sophisticated today, and Nevadans fully understand the risks that are involved with storage of nuclear waste, and they have rejected it both by the State legislature since that period of time, and Democrats and Republicans alike, in the most recent survey, in numbers in excess of 70 percent categorically reject that storage. 
So I think it is somewhat unfair to suggest we be judged by an earlier time, less sophisticated, more naive and perhaps, if we can be faulted, more trusting. 
Let me just say by way of conclusion, this is a highly technical debate. Much of it is arcane, much of it is not easy to understand, and for that reason, I am indebted to the senior Senator from Idaho, because I think he has framed the issue that all of us can understand. 
If you believe that the shipment of nuclear waste, 125-ton casks by rail, 25-ton casks by truck, containing the equivalent radioactivity of 200 bombs the size dropped on Hiroshima, is as safe as the transportation of milk from the market to your home or across the country, let me just say you should vote against the Reid and Bryan amendment. But if you believe, as I believe most Americans do, that when you are shipping nuclear waste, 85,000 metric tons, 17,000 shipments, for decades to come over thousands and thousands of miles through 43 States where 51 million Americans live within a mile, then I think you might think that it is a little bit more risky than shipping milk from point A to point B. I believe that the logic of the Reid-Bryan amendment is inescapable, and I believe that you want to support us and to protect the citizens of your State. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I know this all gets pretty arcane and esoteric. But I think the presentation made by the Senator from Alaska would maybe give the impression that somehow ratepayers would be victimized under the present system. I think some clarification needs to be made. I think it is important to understand that each of the reactors that he referenced will have a period of time in which they shut down. That is because each reactor is licensed for a fixed period of time. So if one looks at all of the reactors across the country, the last reactor to shut down is in the year 2033. And between now and the year 2033 all of the reactors which have been referenced in the charts which the Senator from Alaska has called to our attention will shut down depending upon the period of their license. 
So the point I seek to make is that over the next 40 years, or 36 years, each of the reactors will be licensed. 
I mention that because the responsibility of the nuclear waste fund exists long after the last reactor shuts down. That is to say there will continually be a responsibility until it is estimated the year 2071 to deal with the issue of nuclear waste because as reactors close down fuel will be moved into the ponds or the pools. Then ultimately in theory they will be transported to a permanent repository. 
So you can see it here. This is the mill fee presently under the law. Each utility is paying one mill for each kilowatt-hour generated by a nuclear reactor. That is the current payment schedule. That mill fee payment will decline. As you can see here, here is 1995, but you can see going out to the year 2033, or thereabouts, it will be zero. The reason for that is that the mill fees being paid into the nuclear waste trust fund are only generated by kilowatt-hours generated by nuclear reactors. So you can see here that the balance of the nuclear waste trust fund peaks up here sometime around the year 2010. So in all of this buildup referenced in the fund, that buildup is going to be necessary because of the outyears, after 2033 when not 1 cent will go into the nuclear waste trust fund because there will be no reactors generating electrical energy. You will need the money to take care of it in the outyears. 
So what is occurring now was contemplated in 1982 when the Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act; namely, that there would be a mill fee payment system in which the mill fees would go into the nuclear waste trust fund, that it would build up to a substantial surplus, and that surplus would be needed in the outyears when the responsibility to handle the waste continues even though no money is going into the nuclear waste trust fund. 
A ratepayer can make a legitimate complaint or a grievance in 1998, as we have all agreed on the floor. There is no permanent repository open. There is no type of storage that will be available under any scenario. Whatever ill-conceived form S. 104 could possibly be enacted in, there is no way that there will be any storage space available at any kind of an interim facility in the year 1998. 
Having recognized that, this Senator has offered legislation over the years that says in effect that after 1998, when utilities may incur additional costs because they had expected that a nuclear waste repository would be opened, a nuclear utility could incur additional expense. I concede that. The additional expense may be that they have to provide some dry cask storage, and they may have to reconfigure the space where they currently have the fuel assemblies racked. There could be some additional costs. And that would be unfair to the ratepayer because the system of mill fee payments did contemplate that in 1998 there would be storage facilities open. 
So the solution to any contention of inequity is to simply say that, if the legislation which I have introduced on a number of occasions is to the extent that a utility incurs any additional expense after 1998 because the permanent storage is 
not available, that utility should be able to offset its additional costs by reducing its payments into the nuclear waste trust fund. That is fair, Mr. President. But the notion that somehow the utilities have paid all of this money in and they are not getting what they bargained for is simply not the case. It is true that there is no permanent storage in 1998. We recognize that in the legislation which I have introduced, and we simply provide the utilities an offset. 
I urge my colleagues, those who may have an interest in this, to look at the `Nuclear Waste Fund Fee Adequacy and Assessment.' This is a document prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. That has the full schedule of what is contemplated by way of receipts into the fund as well as the expenses that would be incurred after 2033. 
Finally, let me make a point. If we are truly talking about being financially responsible, this fund, according to the General Accounting Office, is underfunded by as much as $4 billion to $8 billion. That is to say every bit of this buildup, plus an additional $4 billion to $8 billion, will be necessary in order to handle the waste out to the year 2071 when there will still be responsibilities under the time schedule. 
So I think it is misleading to suggest that in some way the utility ratepayers are being dealt with unfairly. They certainly would be dealt with unfairly if they are not able to offset the expense. 
I must say I am rather surprised that this legislation, S. 104, does nothing to deal with the fact that there will be additional costs incurred by the utilities after 1998. That is the legislation that has been pending before the Congress for a number of years. 
I would also point out to my colleagues that as recently as this past month the newly confirmed Secretary of Energy has indicated he is willing to sit down and talk to the utilities about compensation in the form of additional expenses that they may incur. So when you look at it in that context, this has nothing to do with unfairness to the ratepayers. It has nothing to do with double payments. We can and should responsibly deal with that issue. This is again the siren's call that the industry has invoked now for two decades. `We just want to get this stuff moved. Let's get it on a train. Let's get it on a truck. Let's get it out of town today, tomorrow, and we could care less what may occur.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the amendment being offered by the Senator from Alaska is designed to address a point of order that would lie with this bill with respect to the budget process. We have heard almost endlessly on the floor that the poor ratepayers are not getting this, they are not getting that. We have tried to respond by saying we think the ratepayers have a legitimate issue to raise after 1998, and that there should be a reduction in the payments into the fund because some additional costs are going to be incurred before a permanent repository can be made available under any scenario that one would choose to fantasize. 
This is kind of another budget gimmick, and it is technical, but let me just say very briefly that what this does is it deals with nuclear waste that was accumulated prior to 1982, in which the utilities would incur an obligation to pay for that. There were several options available. A number of utilities elected not to make that payment until nuclear waste was actually being received by the permanent repository. So we are not talking about an inconsequential sum, and ratepayers may be interested to know that their utilities, or at least some of them, are going to be paying $2.7 billion before they would otherwise have been required to do so under the previous agreement to deal with the budget. This is designed, it is a budget gimmick, so it does not result in being vulnerable to a budget point of order. 
It does, apparently--we are going to have this reviewed--it does, apparently, deal with the budget point of order the senior Senator from Nevada and I were about to make. But I think the point needs to be made, anybody who has this compassion and concern for ratepayers, what this does is trigger the obligation to pay that $2.7 billion before any interim repository could possibly be opened anywhere, under any scenario, before any permanent repository. 
Somehow I do not see how this is a better deal for the ratepayers who originally were led to believe that they would have until after nuclear waste was initially received before this $2.7 billion obligation. 
So, it looks to me like the ratepayers are on the short end of this one.

I do not intend to offer an objection, but I think it would be helpful for those who have been listening to the debate, am I not correct this one-time fee, which I am told is $2.7 billion, was not due until the time at which the utilities actually had the waste removed, which would have been 10 or 15 years, whatever the case may be? This does require an accelerated payment by them in order to comply with the Budget Act; is that not correct?

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-bryan-nv-11-19970410</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I understand the concern that my friend from Tennessee has. It is a concern that Nevadans have had for many years. Let me say where I respectfully disagree with him is that if he is concerned about the movement of nuclear waste to an interim storage facility, the most effective protection that the State of Tennessee and all States have is the existing law--is the existing law. 
There are two provisions in the existing law. One of them is specifically in reference to the Senator's concern from the State of Tennessee and, indeed, is a product of the Tennessee State delegation's actions on the floor a decade ago. 
Under the present law, no interim storage anywhere in any State can be located until an application for license of a permanent repository. So his State under the current law is absolutely protected, as is every other State. And the reason why that was inserted in the legislation at that time was a policy consideration. 
Our colleagues then recognized the great temptation that an interim or temporary facility might become a permanent repository de facto, a concern which the Senators from Nevada are very gravely concerned about. So every State that is concerned about it being a potential target for interim storage under the present law has no need to worry at all. That is the ultimate protection. 
The law right now precludes the location of interim storage until the application for licensure for the permit. You cannot have a better protection than that. So if that is the Senator's concern from the State of Tennessee, as I know it is the Senators' from many States, that is the best protection that the State of Tennessee and others have. 
Let me just explain to my colleagues what the Senator from Tennessee is asking. The Senator from Tennessee, in the amendment, is asking that his State be exempted from any consideration. 
Under the provisions of S. 104, if the President finds there is a reason to reject the permanent storage at the Yucca Mountain facility, then the President is given a time to choose an alternative location for interim storage. And if he does so, that decision has to be approved by the Congress at a subsequent time. 
So, in effect, the President would be required to make a choice as to another location around the country, and that decision would have to be ratified by an act of Congress, signed into law by the President. 
We believe that S. 104 is unnecessary and unwise, so that our view is that we ought not to be in that position in terms of the legislation, that we ought to reject that because it is unnecessary and unwise and we ought to proceed on the present course, which is to continue the site characterization process that is occurring at Yucca Mountain. 
But let me just say, again, with great respect to my friend, who I admire greatly, from Tennessee, he is asking his State to be exempted, even though in 1987 when the Department of Energy--one can assume based upon scientific considerations--had made a determination that three sites in Tennessee would be the best sites in the country for interim storage. If you look at the history of this act, that is the essence of what has gone wrong, why this act, which was originally conceived with some sense of balance and fairness, has gone so far astray. 
The original law in 1982, signed into law by the President in 1983, was that we would search the entire country and look for the best site for a permanent repository. 
That is pretty hard to argue in principle--nobody exempt, everybody on the board. And we look for the best site. It was also contemplated there would be some regional balance, that we would look into different types of geology--granite, salt domes, welded tuff, perhaps others as well--and that then three sites 
would be studied, and the President of the United States, from those three sites, would make the decision that has at least some pretension of being rational and fair and scientific. 
Here is what happened: Not science, but politics. The 1984 election illuminates the year after the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is enacted into law. Immediately, the incumbent President and his supporters assured people in the Southeast, `Don't worry. We'll never choose the salt domes.' It had nothing to do with science. That is all politics. That was one of the first corrupting acts that in effect destroyed any pretense of science, balance, fairness, objectivity. 
And then fast forwarding, the Department of Energy began to gather data, and their internal memorandum said, look, the folks in the Northeast are going to object to this, there will be strong political opposition, and the Department of Energy unilaterally abandoned any pretense of a search for a site in a granite formation. Nothing to do with science. Absolutely nothing. 
Then what remained of the act was that we would provide the President of the United States, whoever that person might be, with three choices. That was emasculated in 1987, when the `Screw Nevada' bill was enacted, having nothing to do with science. Nobody argued Yucca Mountain should be considered solely and exclusively to the exclusion of everything else except the nuclear utilities and their supporters. 
I do not believe you can find a scientist worth his or her salt that will tell you that we ought to have all of our nuclear eggs in one basket. It would be better to have some options on the table to consider other locations and then let the process go forward from there. That is what has made this entire siting process so utterly devoid of any kind of credibility, because the politics has worked through it. 
We need the South, so we assured them, in 1984, you will be home free. The DOE looks at political opinion and reaction in the Northeast--no, we are sure not going to look at you. And then the utilities come in and say, look, we do not like the idea of having three sites studied; let us just study the Nevada site--having absolutely nothing to do with science. 
Now, fast forward to 1997. I invoke the aid of deity in praying to God we do not get S. 104 enacted into law, and I believe we will not because of the President of the United States, who is taking, in my judgment, the right policy and trying to restore some credibility to the process. However, if S. 104 were enacted into law, the President of the United States is mandated, if he finds Yucca Mountain unsuitable, to make another choice for interim storage. That would have to be submitted to the Congress for approval. 
Now, what we are saying is no, we should not allow the President to make that choice. 
We ought not to exempt Tennessee, as my friend from Tennessee would have us do, or this morning as our colleagues from South Carolina got their State exempted, and previously the State of Washington. That has absolutely nothing to do with science. That has everything to do with politics. 
If you believe for one moment that S. 104 has any merit at all--and in my view it has none, and I oppose it strenuously on a number of grounds that we will get into at a later time during the debate--should not the President of the United States, who is being directed to make other selections with respect to interim storage, have a full range of discretion as to where he should tentatively make that choice, which is always subject to approval by the Congress. We have the right to disagree. But, in effect, what we want to do with these series of amendments that we have dealt with this morning--the Washington exemption, the South Carolina exemption, and now the exemption of my friend from Tennessee--we want to load the deck. It is a stacked deck. `You cannot look at us; we are in Tennessee.' `You cannot look at us; we are in South Carolina.' That does not have any policy justification at all, in my judgment. 
I understand the concern of the able Senator from Tennessee about transporting all this nuclear waste through his State. It would be substantial and extensive. That is why I wish he were allied with us, because if he were, the State of Tennessee and other States would be immune and protected from the irresponsible course of conduct which S. 104 directs us to do. 
It is for that reason I find myself in opposition to his amendment, No. 1, on the basis of policy; and No. 2, I believe that makes this legislation, if it is possible, even less defensible than it is in its present unamended form.

I invite the Senator's attention looking at this chart. If I understand the point he is trying to make, before S. 104 would be enacted--these would be the various reactor sites--every site prior to its enactment is still there and we add one more at Yucca Mountain, or at the Nevada test site. So we have 110.

Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is correct; 17,000 shipments of approximately 85,000 metric tons, shipments that would occur over a period of several decades. So, in effect, what we would have, wherever you live in America, nuclear waste would be streaming into your community and into your State from virtually every point on the compass, not just for a brief period of time but for decades as contemplated.

Mr. BRYAN. I have never challenged the Senator's math. That was not the subject that I either excelled in or like. But it seems to me that the Senator is right. I remind my senior colleague that we had an accident, as I recall in 1982, in Livingston, LA. If we use a computer model to determine whether the proposed standards of these casks have no problem at all--these are casks not yet in existence but the proposed casks that would be used for this transit--that the temperatures generated in that accident--not a nuclear accident--but the temperatures were so high and so intense for such a long period of time that the cask design would fail. That indicates that there would be a release of radioactivity. That is not a theoretical, or speculative, or conjectural accident. That is one that actually occurred. If one uses a computer model in terms of the standards being proposed for these casks, those casks would have failed. That means those people in that community--I don't know the area--would have been placed at considerable risk for an extended period of time. 
So, as the Senator is suggesting, multiplying the number of accidents that may occur over the course of several decades, many communities could face that kind of exposure, and that is a legitimate concern, it seems to me, for each of us as we contemplate this very dangerous situation.

Mr. BRYAN. I would say to my senior colleague, his guess is as good as mine. But we know this. We know that there are 43 States that have corridor routes. I envy our friend from Alaska with whom we have been engaged in this debate over the last few days. He is fortunate that his State is not among them. But most of the rest of us are. 
So this is not just a Nevada issue. You have 43 States. You have thousands and thousands of rail and highway miles involved. I remind my colleague that we have 51 million people who live within 1 mile of these rail and highway corridor routes. These are existing routes. Nothing is going to be done new in the context of any construction, or an attempt to bypass communities. We are talking about existing rails and highway corridors. 
So when the Senator asks the question of where those would be, may I say with great respect--and not trying to be flip about it--throw a dart at the map of the lower 48 States in America and his guess and my guess would be as good as any that could be conjectured.

Mr. BRYAN. That was not the case, I say with respect. What is contemplated is interim storage at the Nevada test site. The Nevada test site and Yucca Mountain are two separate geographical areas. And the Senator was asking our distinguished chairman a series of questions. 
Does the Senator understand that if the President of the United States makes no finding with respect to suitability by March 31, 1999, then automatically the interim storage is designated at the Nevada test site automatically?

And if the President of the United States makes a determination that Yucca Mountain is not suitable and submits to the Congress an alternative site other than the interim storage site at the Nevada test site, that if the Congress refuses to accept the President's recommendation then automatically the interim storage comes to the Nevada test site? 
I know the Senator was distracted, and I will repeat that. 
My question to my friend from Idaho is, does the Senator understand that if the President of the United States makes a finding that Yucca Mountain is not suitable and then under the bill is directed to make a choice of an interim storage site, that interim storage site must be approved by an act of Congress, and if the Congress does not approve that site then automatically the Nevada test site becomes the interim storage?

Mr. BRYAN. The point being is, that we do not have a site-selection process here that has any rationale. 
And I guess the last question I would ask, because the Nevada test site has been an area that has been used, as the Senator correctly points out, for testing, is the Senator aware that the equivalency of 85,000 metric tons of nuclear waste which would be stored would require 2.3 million atomic tests the size of the test at Alamogordo during World War II--2.3 million tests?

But the point that I think needs to be made--if the testing schedule at the Nevada test site should continue at its historical rate, it would take between 10,000 and 100,000 years of that testing schedule to equal the radioactive comparability of the nuclear waste that is being stored in the Nevada test site. I just wanted to make that point.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may need. 
Mr. President, I want to continue this discussion of my colleague. Each of us was thinking in the same frame of reference. He said no matter how much you dress up a pig it's still a pig. I learned as a youngster the old adage, you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. And that is exactly what we have here. 
We have not had a chance to review in detail all the asserted changes that the chairman of the committee intends, and we will have a chance to comment on that tomorrow. But central to this debate, the basic issue, the point at which all discussion begins, every thoughtful and analytical and policy frame of reference, is the question of whether or not we should place interim storage anywhere before a determination is made with respect to a permanent repository or dump. That is why the administration continues to oppose this legislation, Senator Bingaman opposes this legislation, why every environmental organization in America opposes this legislation. Because the basic flaw is this is unnecessary and unwise. We will have a chance to expand upon this tomorrow. 
But you go back to the origin of this debate, 17 years ago, you scratch the surface and always the nuclear utility industry and its highly paid advocates have one mission and one mission only--remove the waste from the reactor site. That was the essence of the debate, as we have pointed out time and time again on the floor dating back to 1980 when then the Holy Grail of the industry was an `away-from-reactor' storage program; the same basic concept, anywhere away from here, get it out, away from reactor storage. The Congress wisely rejected in 1980 that approach, just as they have rejected that approach consistently, year after year. 
I want to refer to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We have talked about that a great deal. Much has been made of its contents. But the point that needs to be made is there is no urgent technical need for interim storage of spent fuel--none. Our colleague, the ranking member of the committee, last night, the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], went on at great length about: There is no necessity, no need to do so. Indeed, any thoughtful policy approach rejects that premise. 
Again, in 1997, a reconstituted Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board reaches the same conclusion, namely that there is no necessity and no reason to move at this time. 
They make a second point here that I think is important to emphasize, and that is, if the site selection process is to retain any integrity at all, here is what Dr. Cohon said in his testimony of February 5:  
However, to maintain the credibility of the site-suitability decision, siting a centralized storage near Yucca Mountain-- 
That is interim storage he has reference to-- 
should be deferred until a technically defensible site-suitability determination can be made at Yucca Mountain. 
That is the essence of the argument, that no decision should be made until a defensible site-suitability determination can be made at Yucca Mountain. 
He goes on to say: 
We have estimated that such a determination could be made within about 4 years. 
Those are Dr. Jared Cohon's comments. 
So, Mr. President, it is clear that the nuclear utility industry is scrambling at the last moment to put together a few flourishes on the legislation that is before us, but they will not and cannot change the basic flaw in that they would propose to site interim storage at the Nevada test site before a determination is made with respect to the permanent repository. 
Let me say, for those who have followed this issue over the years, the only justification for siting it at the Nevada test site--and this was debated last year on the floor, to some extent--was the assumption, the predicate that Yucca Mountain would be the permanent repository. That was the only basis. How in the world can you place interim storage until you have a determination made as to whether the permanent facility, which is the whole predicate of the interim storage licensing decision, has been determined, and that has not occurred. 
So this has nothing to do with science. Frequently, science is invoked to defend the course of action that our colleagues on the other side of this issue would urge upon the body. This has absolutely nothing to do with science; it has everything to do with nuclear politics as advocated by the nuclear power industry and their legions of lobbyists who line the hallways and the corridors of this Chamber, as well as the other body. 
A second point I think needs to be made here and was addressed, in part, by my senior colleague, and that is the transportation issue. If we should not be moving it at all until a decision is made, why place at risk the citizens of 43 States, 51 million people, along highway and rail corridors in America? Senator Reid is quite correct that Europe is often cited: `My gosh, they have their situation handled; why can't we do it here?' Believe me, once you start moving 85,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste, you are going to have communities, and rightly so, exercised about the transport of those kinds of volumes. 
The chairman of the committee says, `Well, we're shipping nuclear waste around now.' That is true to some extent, but the difference between 2,500 shipments and 17,000 shipments in which the 2,500 shipments have traveled 900 miles or less is a vastly different proposition in terms of magnitude of risk of shipping waste over thousands of miles. Remember, most of these reactors are in the East and would be transported virtually from coast to coast, a very different proposition again. 
Something else that we have tried to make understandable in this debate to our opponents is the fact that the casks that would be used have not yet been designed, nor have they been manufactured. So we are talking about a totally different reconfigured cask that will take some time. 
I invite my colleagues' attention to the testimony of Dr. Jared Cohon, again, earlier this year when he indicated that it is not just a siting decision. He says: 
But developing a storage facility-- 
And he is referring there, again, to interim storage-- 
requires more than a siting decision. It also requires the development of a transportation system, and it is likely that such transportation system will take several years to develop. 
So the notion that somehow instantaneously this problem is taken care of, just pass S. 104 and all of our problems go away. 
I want to respond to one other issue briefly before concluding. The notion is somehow fostered here that if an interim storage facility is located at the Nevada test site, that rather than having 109 different reactor sites around the country where nuclear waste is stored, we will have only one. Mr. President, that is not correct. We will have 110, not 109. 
Many people may not be familiar with the fact that immediately after a spent fuel cell assembly is removed from the reactor because it no longer has the efficiency necessary to generate electrical power, it is stored for many, many years in a spent-fuel pond or pool for it to cool off for a period of time. We are talking about reactors that are licensed up to the period of 2033. So we are going to have nuclear waste stored at many sites around the country for many, many years, irrespective of S. 104. 
So the notion that is held out of `pass this bill and we will have no nuclear waste other than at the site designated in this bill, the Nevada test site,' is certainly a false premise and, indeed, once the waste is removed, the reactor itself remains and is hazardous for an extended period of time. 
There are many things we will be talking about in more detail during the course of the debate over the next few days. But no matter how they try to recast this as a different piece of legislation, some chameleon-hued piece of nuclear legislation, when you get to the very essence, the core of the legislation, its fatal and unperfectable flaw is that it calls for siting interim storage before the decision is made on the permanent facility, and no one in the scientific community is arguing for that proposition. 
So this is nuclear politics, and we are simply responding to the bidding of the nuclear utility industry, which, for more than a decade now, has urged the Congress, in one form or another, to remove the reactor waste, send it somewhere else, send it anywhere, but get it out from under us, and that is the objection that the policymakers, who have given this their thoughtful attention--the President of the United States and others--have said that is what is wrong with this legislation. It is what was wrong with the legislation in 1996, and that has not changed in the original form in which this bill was introduced, and based upon the discussion of the chairman of the committee, it has not changed in the substitute that is being proposed. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, debate is winding down today. I know we will have an opportunity to debate this issue throughout the next few days. I thought it might be helpful to clarify a statement made by the Senator from Idaho with respect to the canister issue. 
The Senator from Nevada has not said that there are not canisters that have been approved, licensed, and used. There are indeed such canisters. The difference is the kind of canisters that are contemplated in the shipments that will be involved in sending some 75,000 metric tons of nuclear waste to a site in Nevada that have not yet been designed and have not yet been produced. So all of the film footage that the Nuclear Energy Institute and its supporters have used is footage with respect to canisters that would not be used in the kind of massive shipments that are contemplated here. 
What is contemplated here is a canister by rail that would accommodate 20 to 24 fuel assemblies. That would be the equivalent weight of about 125 tons; it is a rail cask. And each truck cask would weigh at least 25 tons. So the standards are out there, but they have not yet been designed and built. 
There was a reference, at least lately, that the concerns expressed by the Senators from Nevada with respect to the standards that have been proposed for the new enlarged canister are standards that are more than adequate to meet the task, and, indeed, that there may be some scare tactics on our part in referencing those. 
Let me just simply indicate that the Livingston, LA, fire--I want to be very clear on this--involved a 1982 train derailment. That is a fact. The circumstances of that accident are not theoretical or hypothetical. They are real. The Nuclear Regulation Commission itself--not a group of Nevada legislators or the scientists that have been engaged by Nevada to argue the case here but the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself--applied the conditions in the aftermath of the Livingston, LA, fire to the standards that are to be used in this new enlarged cask configuration and acknowledged that the high temperatures in that fire--not a theoretical fire--would cause an NRC-approved cask to fail. In their words, `The radiological hazard would exceed compliance values by up to a factor of four.' But the thing that needs to be emphasized--this is not some theoretical, unrealistic, utterly fantastic, farfetched, bizarre set of circumstances that have been conjured up. This relates to a real-life accident in 1982. In that accident, with the fire temperatures that were engendered as a consequence of that derailment applied to the standards which the NRC is proposing for this new canister configuration that would accommodate 20 to 24 fuel assemblies, it would fail. A radiological hazard would be created. That is a statement not by the Senator from Nevada but a statement by the NRC. 
Let me make one additional point, if I may, with respect to the transportation issue. As an indication that we are not yet even ready to transport this volume of waste, I think the proponents of S. 104 would have us believe that if through some, in my judgment, irresponsible, reckless act on the part of the Congress to enact this legislation, if this were enacted today, indeed, if the storage facility were opened today, then immediately a mass migration of nuclear waste would occur from the repository sites currently; namely, at the nuclear reactors where they are located and where this flow of shipments began. 
I think it is important to try to give some balance because this is not a panacea even if you buy into this corporate welfare program that the nuclear power utilities would have us embrace. I think the words of Dr. Jared Cohon, who is the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--again, a body created by this Congress, not by some Nevada oversight group--points out:  
Developing a storage facility requires more than a siting decision. It also requires the development of a transportation system and developing a transportation infrastructure, including the transportation cap, and enhanced safety capabilities along the routes necessary to move significant amounts of waste will likely take years longer than would be needed to develop a centralized storage facility. 
I need to make that point again. I mean, the thrust of this debate--and you will hear much more from our colleagues who are saying that somehow it is a panacea of S. 104, if enacted and signed into law, that immediately the waste will be removed from the reactor sites. That is simply not true. Even if theoretically a site could be opened in the next year or 18 months--and absolutely no one believes that--siting interim storage would require at least 3 or 4 years. 
But assume for the sake of argument that the site was available, what Dr. Cohon is telling us is that because we do not have the casks currently in existence--the standards, yes, but not the casks--that it would take us a while to develop the transportation system that would be required; that it will require a few years to get that done. 
So all of this talk about the casks that have been depicted on film and all of the discussion about the casks being dropped from 30 feet, 50 feet, 60 feet, or 100 feet, are totally irrelevant. We 
are talking about casks that will not be used for this purpose. We are talking about a new configuration cask that has not yet been developed, and I think that point needs to be emphasized. 
Let me make one other point, if I may, with respect to the notion that somehow because Nevada, responding to a patriotic call during the height of the cold war in 1951, agreed to allow nuclear testing at the Nevada test site--I was in the eighth grade the year the nuclear testing began in Nevada. I have to tell you that it was a different age and a different time than it is today. We were all pretty naive about what that was about. Were we excited? Yes. We all thought it was a great thing. We were on the cutting edge in technology. In those days the nuclear power lobby convinced America that everything would be nuclear, that we would have little reactors in our back yards and planes would be powered by nuclear fuel; locomotives; and, indeed, as was often said, the nuclear power will be so cheap that it can't be measured. That goes back 46 years ago. 
In my hometown of Las Vegas, businesses changed their names to atomic groceries, atomic this and that. There was an atomic hairdoo. Yes. Nevadans sensed that they were being asked to respond to a patriotic call of the Federal Government to respond to a confrontation that we had with a superpower, the Soviet Union. That frightened all of us. I hope that my friends would not suggest that because we responded to that, that there is somehow implicit a duty to accept civilian reactor wastes generated on site, a decision made by local utilities and local customers, and that that somehow be sent to us in Nevada. 
I might just say parenthetically with respect to that rather naive world in which we lived in 1951, today every American pays as part of his or her tax dollars to the people who are downwind from those nuclear detonations that we were assured at the time that they were absolutely safe--`Don't worry about it. It is the most exciting thing in the world.' We invited members of the fourth estate, the Department of Energy. Then it was called the Atomic Energy Commission. There was a little place. They built bleachers for them called News Nob. Come on up and see for yourselves. This is science. This is exciting stuff, folks. 
We sent thousands of our military personnel to a place called Camp Desert Rock, and we dug trenches out there and showed them what the exposure would be like to atmospheric radiation. 
Mr. President, if any responsible scientist suggested that that was absolutely safe today, I mean he or she would be hounded out of any kind of scientific academy that exists. We all know now that is dangerous stuff. It is very hazardous, and a lot of people downwind paid with their lives, and paid through genetic damage which they have experienced and suffered from cancers. As a consequence, each of us as taxpayers in America today compensate those victims. 
Let me make a distinction, if I may. It has been suggested that somehow because the test sites were used for this purpose, it is an absolutely logical, inescapable conclusion that it should be the repository for this interim site. That is fallacious reasoning. 
First of all, we are talking about two entirely different kinds of radioactivity. Remember what we are talking about here with high-level nuclear waste--stuff that by its very definition is deadly for thousands and thousands of years. Nobody quarrels with that in the debate--thousands and thousands of years. We all recall that in the aftermath of dropping two atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War II--one at Hiroshima and one at Nagasaki--that those two cities did not remain isolated for decades or even a score of years. They were rebuilt immediately. The reason is that it is a different type of radiation. There is no question that there is a radiation hazard in the blinding seconds of the detonation. We have all seen that. But it is not the kind of residual radiation that requires isolation and protection for thousands of years. 
Let me make a couple of points. I know the distinguished 
chairman of the Energy Committee has taken the floor. I can assure him I will be just a couple of minutes. 
Here is the difference. Trinity was the first successful atomic detonation in the history of the world at Alamogordo in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945. That is the first one. That is when we knew we had a bomb that would work. In order to equate the radioactive equivalent of what is referred to as the fission product inventory that would be stored in Nevada as a result of all of these 75,000 to 85,000 metric tons, it would require the equivalent of 2.3 million nuclear detonations--let me repeat that again: 2.3 million detonations--of the Trinity-sized atomic bomb to create the equivalent of what is proposed to be stored at the Nevada test site. 
Placed in another context, because Nevada did agree to host the testing programs, based upon the average yearly testing rate during the period that the Nuclear Weapons Program was operational at the Nevada test site that was approximately 20 nuclear weapons detonations per year, in order to equate to the fission product equivalent of what is being proposed to be shipped here, it required that rate of testing, namely 20 nuclear weapons tests a year, for a period of from 10,000 to 100,000 years. So we are not talking about some finite distinction. We are talking about something that is of a totally different magnitude, a totally different character. 
I say to my friends who tried to equate the nuclear testing program during the days of the cold war with storage of high-level nuclear waste from civilian reactors, you are talking about apples and oranges in a literal sense. So we are not talking about the same thing. We are talking about waste that by its very nature is deadly for thousands and thousands of years. No one disagrees with that. We are talking about nuclear detonations which have a totally different type of radioactive footprint and which would require the equivalent of 2.3 million Trinity detonations to get the same equivalency being discussed, or a testing protocol that would call for 20 nuclear detonations a year that would have to last from between 10,000 and 100,000 years to equal what is being proposed to be sent to Nevada. 
I just think those two points need to be made. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to return to what I think is the fundamental flaw in this legislation, and that is that it is unneeded, unwise, and unsafe. When you ask who wants this legislation, the only one that is really pushing it, the driving force, is the nuclear utilities. That is where this all comes from. Every environmental organization in the country has expressed its opposition. The scientific community--the Congress established the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. I will repeat for the benefit of my colleagues, in 1989 a commission was part of the review process. They said there was no safety advantage to interim storage. In 1996, we have a report from the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board that said there is no urgent technical need for centralized storage of commercial spent fuel. There is no safety factor to consider. And the same technical review board, constituted with new members in 1997, has offered testimony to the effect that it would be a very unwise decision because it would interfere with the permanent siting process. 
That was testimony that was given on February 5. So, if we are asking about science and the scientific community, they have expressed themselves. They said this is not a good idea. If you are asking about the environmental community, where they are coming from, they are saying it is not a good idea. 
Yesterday, I spent a few moments talking about the specifics of the bill. Let me just very briefly retrace some of those issues for us. In effect, what this legislation does is to gut a process that was a bipartisan piece of legislation, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. If you look at page 47, and you 
go through a number of the specific provisions there--and we will debate this, I suspect, at greater length during the course of the week--but the act virtually emasculates the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. It says, yes, there will be an environmental impact statement, but the statement may not consider the need for interim storage, the time of initial availability, any alternatives to spent fuel storage, any alternatives to the site of the facility, any alternatives to the design, the environmental impact of the storage beyond the initial term of the license, which is 20 years. This makes an absolute mockery of any kind of profession that this follows NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act, of 1969. 
There are other provisions as well that refer to the preemption of all Federal environmental laws. That is section 501. We have talked about that extensively during the course of the debate. There are standards which are compromised in this provision. For example, there is a statutory provision that occurs on page 56 that indicates, rather than the Environmental Protection Agency having the ability, independent and unfettered, to make a judgment as to what the correct standard would be in terms of radioactive emission exposure, it sets a 100 millirem standard by statute and requires the EPA to affirmatively prove that the overall system performance standard would constitute an unreasonable risk to health and safety. 
We did not do that anyplace else in terms of the WIPP facility which was debated last year. The two able Senators from New Mexico made forceful statements that they believed, because the WIPP facility was going to be operational in their State, they had the expectation that EPA would establish the highest possible standards to protect the health and safety of New Mexicans. Who among us could disagree with that? But that is not the standard for us here in Nevada. The EPA is constrained and limited, in terms of what it can do, and here is an example of 100 millirems of radiation, S. 104. There is safe drinking water, other low-level-waste facilities--the WIPP facility, which I just mentioned, has a standard of 15 millirems during the course of a year. So this thing is absolutely so phony in terms of any kind of protection for health and safety, it ought to be something of concern to any legislator, irrespective of where the final destination may be. 
Let me say, the National Academy of Sciences--these are scientists, not people selected by the Governor of Nevada or the Nevada congressional delegation--go through a whole list of things they recommend. They recommend a risk-based standard rather than a 100 millirem standard. They have recommended the protective standard be defined by a critical group: a small, relatively homogeneous group be representative of those expected to receive the highest doses. That is not included. 
They maintain that, in terms of the length of time, because nuclear waste is lethal for thousands and thousands of years, there should be no cutoff period of time, that there must be an ability to protect for thousands of years. What does S. 104 provide? That you can only consider the first 1,000 years. I suppose, whether you are an advocate for term limits or not, we would all agree that 1,000 years is not going to affect anybody in this Chamber. But, I mean for something that is deadly for 10,000 years and beyond, that is simply irresponsible to put those kinds of handcuffs on. 
Human intrusion--all of the scientific community acknowledges there is no scientific basis for assuming there would be no human intrusion during these thousands and thousands of years. The statute we are dealing with, S. 104, directs just the contrary, to make an assumption that there is to be no human intrusion. 
The National Academy of Sciences said that these raise complicated policy issues. There ought to be opportunity for wide-ranging input from all interested parties. These are set by statute, under S. 104--no public comment. 
So, I must say that in terms of science, in terms of fairness, in terms of health and public safety, this piece of legislation is 
a disaster not only for my State but for America. 
I want to speak for just a moment about the transportation issue and some of the film footage that has appeared. First, I think it is important for us to understand that, although Nevada, under this legislation, is the ultimate repository on an interim basis, there are some 43 States, 51 million Americans who live within a mile of each of these major corridors. The red depicts the highways, the blue depicts the rail. 
You are going to have, wherever you may be looking on this map here, you are going to have roughly 16,000 shipments that would pass along these corridors--16,000. It has been suggested that the Department of Energy is experienced, but I think to put this in some context, Mr. Dreyfus, who was the head of the Radioactive Waste Management Office, an individual well known to my colleagues, having testified before the Energy Committee on a number of times, says this: `Material like this,' referring to nuclear waste, `has been moving around for a long time. So that is not a technical challenge,' he says. `But compared to the kind of campaign what we are talking about, what the industry has been doing up to now is trivial. We are talking about a magnitude of many times greater. We are talking about 16,000 shipments.' 
Since 1975, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported shipments that are sent by rail or by truck averaged approximately 900 miles or less. We are talking about thousands of miles. As the occupant of the Chair knows, our States are in the West and far removed from most of these reactor sites. So, I think it is important to make that point. 
Let me add a couple of other things, if I may here. First of all, the casks that have been shown have no relevance to this debate--none. The casks that would be used for shipping have not been designed. They are not in existence. The casks that are used in the film prepared by the Nuclear Energy Institute refer to a previous generation of smaller casks. Those are not what is contemplated. Those are not what is contemplated. We are talking about a new generation of casks, casks that do not meet standards which we believe every such cask should meet. 
For example, it requires a 30-minute exposure to a fire at 1,475 degrees. However, diesel fuel burns at an average of 1,800 degrees and can reach 3,200 degrees. So the 30-minute proposed standard for these yet-to-be-designed and produced casks does not address real world accidents, where train wrecks can burn for hours, if not for days. None of the tests would require that kind of protection. 
The NRC has estimated that 6 out of every 1,000 rail accidents could cause fundamental damage that will cause the cask to fail. Given the 16,000 shipments that are contemplated, that comes to 96 accidents where the NRC-approved standard would fail. I submit that is not great comfort to those millions of Americans who are going to be along the route. 
The NRC claims the cask design will prevent radioactive leakage in severe accidents. But the cask design has never--repeat, never--been tested in lifelike situations. In one computer simulation, the NRC chose four real-life severe transportation accidents and applied these conditions to a cask meeting NRC specs. 
In one of those real-life accidents, which involved a 1982 train derailment and fire in Livingston, LA--this was an accident that occurred and a fire that resulted--the NRC publicly acknowledged that the high temperatures would cause an NRC-approved cask to fail. In their words, `the radiological hazard would exceed compliance values by up to a factor of four.' 
This is not some theoretical accident, a hypothetical. This is an accident that occurred in Livingston, LA, in 1982, and the NRC said the standards they propose would not have protected a cask under their proposed design from releasing radioactivity. That is not much comfort, that is not much assurance for those who are going to be along the highways and railways. 
Let me address an issue that I think has not received the kind of attention that it should, and that is, this bill is a bailout for the nuclear power industry. Dating back to the time of the inception of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, it was always agreed that the utilities themselves should pay for the storage and ultimate disposition of high-level nuclear waste, and the mechanism established was to establish a nuclear waste trust fund in which ratepayers would pay at the rate of 1 mill for each kilowatt hour generated into this trust fund. That is the current way. 
Here is what this bill does. Rather than have the ratepayers pay for the ultimate cost, this bill very cleverly transfers the liability and responsibility to the American taxpayer. The year 2033 is the last year, under currently licensed nuclear reactors, that there will be reactors in operation. Currently, under General Accounting Office actuarial projections, the fund is from $4 billion to $8 billion underfunded in terms of what will be required, because as each reactor goes off line, it no longer contributes to the fund. The last reactor goes off line in the year 2033, and it is required that the expenditures, in terms of dealing with that waste, continue until the year 2071. So years after the last mill is deposited into the nuclear waste trust fund, expenses will continue. As I have indicated, right now the General Accounting Office says this fund is $4 billion to $8 billion underfunded. 
It is contended that the ratepayers have not gotten what they bargained for. That is certainly not true now, and the surplus that is in the account is designed to take care of those years from 2033 to 2071, where nothing will come into the fund by way of a mill-tax levy because there will be no power generated from those reactors. 
Here is a very, very clever way of shifting the liability to the American taxpayer. This bill, in its present form, caps the amount of contribution, even though the current fund is underfunded by $4 billion to $8 billion at 1 mill per kilowatt hour, and after the year 2003, it says that the only mill tax that can be collected would be the amount necessary to pay for the appropriation from the fund that year, providing no revenue for the outyears. 
So this is corporate welfare, this is corporate pork, this is a new entitlement program which will cost the American taxpayers literally billions and billions of dollars in the outyears. 
Everybody acknowledges that the 1998 deadline that was put into the act in 1982 cannot be met. I would say parenthetically, that was not a scientific date that was put in. Indeed, there was resistance in 1982 because it was felt that that time line was too short. This was a deadline that was pushed by our friends, once again, from the nuclear utilities. So it is unfair to blame the Department of Energy and the scientific community for 1998. This was a deadline pushed by the utilities. 
I believe that there is equity and fairness to be provided to the ratepayers, because after 1998, they will not have permanent storage available. In each of the Congresses in which I have served, we have offered legislation that would entitle the utilities to an offset; that is, to the extent that the storage would not be available in 1998 and they would incur additional expense, as they will, that should be an offset or a reduction in the contribution that they pay into the nuclear waste fund so that 
the utility ratepayers do not pay twice. I think that is fair. I think there is a reasonable argument to be made there, and the administration believes that. 
As recently as this past month, there were discussions to provide compensation to the utilities because permanent storage will not be available after 1998, and it was rejected by the utilities. They do not care a wit about that. That is not what they are interested in. They are interested in getting the taxpayer to bail them out for the money that will take beyond the year 2033, to the year 2071, to, in effect, take care of the expenses of the nuclear waste that they generated--that they generated--that they have made profits on over all these many years. So there is not an argument of equity we are addressing here, because not a single provision in S. 104 addresses the question of equity. 
We have a piece of legislation which we have introduced, again, this Congress which we have previously introduced, which says, `Look, after 1998, yes, you don't get the permanent storage that was contemplated, we understand that.' There is no conceivable way that could occur. If this bill was passed tomorrow and signed into law, the 1998 deadline could not be met for at least probably to the year 2001. 
The administration has offered to provide compensation to reimburse utilities for the additional costs incurred, and our legislation would specifically do so. So this has not one thing to do with ratepayers being charged twice. They are given an opportunity for relief, if they want it, in the legislation that my senior colleague from Nevada and I have introduced. So let's put that to rest. 
The lawsuit. The lawsuit changes nothing. The lawsuit was finalized last year before we concluded our date on 1936, the predecessor to S. 104, and the lawsuit simply provides that there is a legal obligation on the part of the Department to take the waste at some point down the line. There is a legal obligation. It in no way suggests that the waste would be physically removed by 1998, and it could not. 
So when you look at the contract, each of the utilities under the 1982 act entered into a contract with the Department of Energy, and that contract simply says that in case there is an avoidable delay, the utility is entitled to an offset in terms of what is being paid into the nuclear waste fund by the amount of additional expense they incur. That is the remedy, that is fair, that is the law. 
The distinguished Presiding Officer is suggesting that my time has about run out. I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
Let me say as we begin this debate in this Congress, it reminds me that we are talking about old wine in a new bottle. These arguments have been advanced for decades now, and the prime mover is the nuclear utility industry. 
The fatal flaw in S. 104 is that it is unnecessary, unneeded, and bad policy. That is not just the Senator from Nevada making that statement. Let me review for the record some of the statements made by various boards and commissions created by the Congress in terms of their response. 
We have the 1989 MRS Commission review. The commission report found no safety advantage to centralizing the storage of spent fuel. In 1996, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board analyzed the issue of interim storage and concluded that there is no urgent technical need for centralized storage of commercial spent fuel--no need, no compelling necessity, no safety advantage to be achieved. That was 1996. Now, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board underwent a change in the composition of the chairmanship, so in effect there was an opportunity for essentially a new board composed of new members to review whether or not they would agree with the position taken by their predecessors in 1996. In testimony offered on February 5, 1997, by Dr. Jared L. Cohen, the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Dr. Cohen simply reaffirmed the position taken by his predecessors, that there is no need, either for technical or safety reasons, to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility for the next few years. He further maintains that to maintain the credibility of the site collection process, any decision with respect to interim storage should be deferred until a technologically defensible site-suitability determination can be made at Yucca Mountain. 
Mr. President, that is what the scientists, the people who the Congress, through a series of legislative enactments, have asked to take a look at that, that is what they say--no need, no safety reasons, no compelling necessity, bad policy. That is what the scientific community says. 
I said at the beginning this is old wine in new bottles. Indeed, Mr. President, it is very, very old wine. The driving policy here is not science; it is the nuclear utilities. It is not a new car. If one looks back nearly two decades ago, on July 28, 1980, this issue was before the Congress. This Senator was not a Member of the body at the time, but the Congressional Record reflects debate on a proposed away-from-reactor concept, which is akin, if you will, to this interim nuclear waste proposal. 
At that time, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Johnston, addressed himself to the issue, referring again to this need to move this nuclear waste away from the reactor sites--the same issue, identical to what is being debated today. This is what the Senator from Louisiana said nearly 17 years ago: `Mr. President, this bill deals comprehensively with the problem of civilian nuclear waste. It is an urgent problem.' Sound familiar? Urgent problem. Urgent problem. `Mr. President, for this Nation, it is urgent, first, because we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call away-from-reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983.' That was 14 years ago. Not a single nuclear reactor in America has been closed or been forced to close because of this issue. Some have closed because of overriding safety concerns about their operation and maintenance. That, Mr. President, is a separate issue. 
So here again we have the nuclear utility industry sounding the drumbeat, issuing a clarion call, generating hysteria, that indeed there will be brownouts across the country and reactors will have to close unless we pass S. 104, the modern day equivalent to the legislation that was before the Senate of the United States some 17 years ago. The answer today is the same as the answer then. There is no compelling necessity, no need, no rational policy to do so, and no safety issue that makes that a compelling issue. 
So we come back to a policy that is driven by the nuclear utilities and their desire, insatiable as it may be, to move the reactor storage from site, somewhere, anywhere, but in this particular piece of legislation to a place at the Nevada Test Site or so-called interim storage. 
I want to take just a few minutes, Mr. President, and we will have an opportunity to debate this at some length, as the distinguished chairman indicated, but let me review the bill, because it is flawed not only in its premise; it is flawed in its content. I want to talk first of all about the National Environmental Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act was enacted in 1969, enacted by bipartisan actions of this Congress, signed by a Republican President, and it was designed to do many things. But it was designed, first, to have an environmental impact addressed before, not after, the decisions are made. 
Now, what this legislation does--and I must give the nuclear utilities credit; their handsomely paid lawyers, legislative advocates, have been skillful, if somewhat deceptive, in terms of what they have crafted here. They say the National Environmental Policy Act, yes, it is applicable. But the Secretary--referring to the Secretary of Energy--shall not prepare an environmental impact statement under this section before conducting the activities that are authorized and commanded by the bill. Yes, the act exists, but you may take no action on it at this earlier phase. And then it goes on to say that the impact statement of the commission, in terms of what it may not address, shall not consider the need for interim storage. 
Mr. President, this is the total antithesis of the underlying predicate of an environmental impact statement. In effect, this ties one hand behind the back of those who would conduct such an environmental impact statement and, on the other hand, writes the script as to its conclusion before any study is undertaken. 
So the first thing they cannot do--Heaven forbid that they should examine the need for interim storage. They can't do that. No, they can't examine the time of the initial availability. They may not, Heaven forbid, consider any alternatives to the storage of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in an interim storage. Heaven forbid that they would be able to consider any alternatives to the site of the facility, or any alternatives to the design criteria, or the environmental impacts of storage of spent nuclear fuel at a high-level radioactive waste at the interim storage beyond the initial term of the license. 
Now, this is very good lawyering, but disastrous public policy, because the initial application calls for a licensure period of 20 years. But when you look at the fine print, that can be extended for another 100 years and can be renewed for 100 years thereafter. So any environmental impact evaluation would be limited to the initial term of the license, 20 years. Why is that particularly significant? Mr. President, what we are dealing with is high-level nuclear waste. It is deadly, not for 20 years, 100 years, or a thousand years, but for more than 10,000 years. The National Academy of Sciences and other distinguished groups that have looked at this have indicated that indeed the impacts must be considered, and they must be considered even beyond the 10,000 years, they argue. This would say limit it to the first period of the initial term of the license, which is 10 years. And, oh, yes, we don't want to have the courts review what may happen. No, that would certainly be contrary to our tradition, our history, our society, and our culture to have any kind of a timely judicial review. This limits judicial review only to the time of licensing. So the impacts, such as they may be, must be considered only at the time that the commission makes a decision on licensing. `No court shall have jurisdiction'--we are talking about Federal court, not a State court. `No court shall have jurisdiction to enjoin the construction or operation of the interim storage facility prior to its final decision on review of the commission's licensing action.' 
It makes a mockery of the National Environmental Policy Act, an absolute mockery. So indeed, that is the first thing it does that would destroy a carefully framed set of legislative policies enacted by Members of both political parties and a Republican President in 1969. 
Now, let me also talk for a moment about a preemption section. This was a subject of considerable debate in the last session of Congress when this virtually identical bill--now, the chairman made some reference to this fact--and I have not seen the language--that there may be some changes in this section. But because we don't have them, let me indicate that the bill as processed by the committee, in section 501, reads as follows: `If the requirements of any Federal, State, or local law, including a requirement imposed by regulation, or by any other means under such a law, are inconsistent with or duplicative of the requirements of the Atomic Energy Act or of this act'--this specific legislation--`the Secretary shall comply only with the requirements of this 
act and the Atomic Energy Act.' 
Mr. President, make no mistake as to what that means. That wipes out virtually every environmental law passed in the last 25 years by this Congress--clean air, safe drinking water--it wipes them all out. That was the posture of the bill when it was presented and acted upon in the last Congress--preemption. That language remains in the committee draft. If there are changes in that, we will comment at a later time. 
Let me talk also about the standards. One may agree or disagree that nuclear energy is good or bad national policy. That is something that is reasonable to debate. But I want to speak specifically here to the standards that are referenced in the act. Now, why are the standards--and the distinguished occupant of the chair is very much aware of the fact that our States are Western States with vast expanses of land, but we are as concerned about the health and safety of our citizens as those of our urban brethren who live along the eastern seaboard. So let us talk about what this legislation does with respect to the standards issue. 
The first thing that it does is it seeks to impose a limitation on the Environmental Protection Agency. Surely, one would agree that if we are to have a facility to store nuclear waste, we ought to have a safe standard. Can there be any fundamental disagreement with that? Well, the answer might appear to be yes. But, clearly, the legislative wordsmiths who have crafted this piece of legislation, much as they did in the last legislative session, have sought to handcuff and limit the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to establish standards. It is cleverly done. Give a gold star for that. But here is what it says: `Such standards shall be consistent with the overall system performance established by this subsection, unless the Administrator determines by rule that the overall system performance standard would constitute an unreasonable risk to health and safety.' Clearly, it shifts the burden of proof. It mandates a legislative standard, greatly diminished, unless the Environmental Protection Agency can prove to the contrary, that it would constitute an unreasonable risk to health and safety. 
Now, why would it be unreasonable to say, look, if you are going to establish this unnecessary, costly and, in my judgment, foolhardy venture, at least provide health and safety standards for the people who are going to have to live with that for 10,000 years. It doesn't mean that that is unreasonable. It is not narrow or parochial. One would think that every Member of this institution would feel that way. But not here. Let me just say that that has been debated before in the context of the WIPP facility and with respect to the WIPP facility, the two able Senators from New Mexico took the floor and, at great length, advocated very effectively that the standard for health and safety should be the toughest standard possible. That occurred in debate in this very Chamber in June 1996. The distinguished senior Senator, Mr. Domenici, said, `What is most important to us and what is most important to the people of New Mexico is that, as this underground facility * * *'--they were talking about the WIPP facility--`proceeds to the point where it may be opened, that it be subject to the Environmental Protection Agency's most strict requirements with reference to health and safety. As a matter of fact, they must certify it before it can be opened.' 
I applaud the senior Senator from New Mexico for his concern for his constituents. I agree with him. I hope my colleague from Nevada and I will be provided the same benefit that would be afforded to the New Mexico Senators, as they expressed it. Mr. Bingaman expressed himself eloquently to the issue on that same day, the foremost concern that I have. What the junior Senator from New Mexico said is, `Our concern from the beginning is whether or not we are adequately protecting the health and safety of our citizens.' 
Mr. President, we may not agree on everything in terms of public policy. There is certainly ample room for policy debate on a whole host of issues. I acknowledge that. But believe me, it 
seems to me that we ought to be able to agree that health and safety is the most important thing that we ought to be about. 
I want to return to the subject of additional standards, because what this legislation does is quite manipulative. It limits the ability of those that we have vested with the responsibility of protecting our health and safety, in my view, in a very, very sinister way. First of all, it establishes, by legislative fiat, a 100 millirem standard. We are talking about radioactive emission exposure. I freely acknowledge, Mr. President, that I could not define a millirem with any degree of specificity. But I do know that it is the scientific unit that is accepted as the standard by which emissions are to be measured. I invite the attention of the body to the fact that for safe drinking water, it is a four millirem standard. We have other standards that are set, such as the WIPP standards, which the distinguished Senators from New Mexico addressed so eloquently last year as they were concerned about the health and safety of New Mexicans, just as Senator Reid and I are concerned about the health and safety of Nevadans. 
Let me suggest--it's perhaps wildly idealistic--shouldn't we all be concerned about the health and safety of Americans? We are one country, one nation. As I will point out in a minute, this is not just a Nevada issue. This affects tens of millions of people who would be affected by the policy implications of this bill. Let me go on and say that if you are from the Nordic countries, it is 10 millirems. The upper range Yucca Mountain study is 30 millirems. I cite this because it is so blatant. 100 millirems. That is a standard that is fixed not by science--oh, no, the utility lawyers put that one in there for us to contend with. 
Now, the National Academy of Sciences is a highly respected body. What they have indicated would be appropriate is a risk-based standard. It seems reasonable to me. I hasten to emphasize, Mr. President, there are no Nevadans that are on the National Academy of Sciences. They were not selected by the Nevada delegation, Nevada's Governor, or the Nevada Legislature. They were created by an act of Congress--the National Academy of Sciences. That is what they have recommended. Who is to be protected? This gets a little technical. Under S. 104, the standard of protection is greatly reduced. It is done in almost an arcane expression, but, in effect, a person whose physiology, age, general health, agricultural practices, eating habits, and social behavior represent the average for persons living in the vicinity of the site--the `vicinity of the site'; we do not know what that means--extremes in social behavior, eating habits, or other relevant practices or characteristics, shall not be considered. 
Has the National Academy of Sciences agreed with that standard? They have not. They believe that it ought to be a critical group, a small, relatively homogeneous group whose location and habits are representative of those expected to receive the highest doses. Those expected to receive the highest doses makes sense to me. 
One of the other provisions in here is the application. In other words, for what period of time must health and safety be considered? We are talking about an interim facility that could, under the terms of this legislation, last for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. There is a limitation again because the utilities don't want a scientific standard. They want something that they can lobby through the Congress and get what they want. 
So this legislation tells us that the commission shall issue the license--referring to the license to operate the interim facility--if it feels or finds reasonable assurance that for the first 1,000 years following the commencement of the repository operations--1,000 years; the recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences is that the repository should be required to meet a standard during a period of greatest risk and that there is no scientific basis for limiting the time period to 10,000 years, or any other value. I hasten to note that they believe that the standard should be considered even beyond the 10,000 years. 
There is another provision in here that again is arcane but particularly significant. That is that the commission is mandated to assume no human intrusion--that is to say, in the next 10,000 years--if no human intrusion would be possible. The National Academy of Sciences conclude that there is no scientific basis for assuming there would be no human intrusion.  
The performance of the repository . . . should be assessed using the same analytical methods and assumptions, including those by the biosphere, the critical groups used in the assessment of the performance for the undisturbed case. 
The National Academy of Sciences also recommends another very important provision. That is, that because these involve important policy issues, opportunities for rulemaking necessitates wide-ranging inputs from all interested parties. 
That simply means giving people an opportunity to be heard, to express themselves, to offer their own insights, and to allow those with the technical background to offer the technical analyses. That should be a matter of record before a decision. But not S. 104; these are set by statute with no public comment period allowed. 
So, Mr. President, we have something that is fatally flawed because it is not needed. It makes no sense. We have something that currently preempts the environmental laws of this country, emasculates the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and establishes standards which are arbitrary and not predicated upon science. 
We will hear, as we have heard in previous debates, that this is all about science, to let science prevail. This legislation makes a mockery of the scientific process. It seeks to impose by legislative fiat a policy and a parameter limitation that is inconsistent with science. 
So let no one take the floor and argue that this is science that is speaking. This is nuclear utility politics speaking. That is the only thing that is being responded to. 
We have all agreed--the White House, the Congress, Democrats and Republicans--that we are going to balance the budget in the next 5 years. I want to specifically reference some of the language as it relates to the funding. 
The General Accounting Office has indicated in a report that the current fiscal condition of the nuclear waste fund will experience a shortfall of some $4 to $8 billion. That is to say that under its current construction, without the changes that this legislation makes, there would be a shortfall of $4 
billion to $8 billion. I think many of my colleagues are aware that the nuclear waste trust fund is funded by a mill tax, a mill tax that is assessed on each kilowatt-hour that is generated. If we are currently underfunded, as the General Accounting Office has indicated, let me show you that the real significance of this legislation from a financial point of view is to shield the nuclear utilities from the liabilities that they agreed to undertake at the time the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was entered into and the agreements were signed and to shift their responsibility in the financial sense to the American taxpayer. 
This legislation provides that until the year 2002 the current 1 mill per kilowatt-hour will get capped. That is the maximum that can be collected from the utilities. That is a cap, contrary to the existing law which presents no such cap. 
In addition, this legislation provides that from the year 2003 the aggregate amount of fees--I will read the specific language. Although it is written in bill-drafting legalese, I think it will be clear to all. `The aggregate amount of fees collected during each fiscal year, or thereafter, shall be no greater than the annual level of appropriations for expenditures on those activities.' 
If we put that in the context of what is being spent this year, it would be roughly one-third of the mill, which would be the most that could be assessed. 
Why is that significant? That is significant because the last reactor license will expire sometime around the year 2033, and the responsibility for maintaining a repository would go on, in an active sense, for at least, say, roughly another 40 years. So that means that that kind of funded liability will be shifted from the nuclear utilities to the American taxpayer. 
I say to my friends--and I was supportive of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and I think that makes sense--that I believe one of the great legacies this Congress could leave to the American people is to get our fiscal house in order, to do some responsible things for the budget, and to reach that balanced budget goal by the year 2002. But, Mr. President, there is no way that you can give the utilities a bailout, a subsidy, if you will, a new corporate entitlement, to elevate corporate welfare to a high art form as this piece of legislation does. It caps their liability and says we will take care of the rest contrary to existing law. Existing law does not contemplate that that be true. 
Moreover, this legislation, S. 104, contemplates that that would be an interim storage. That would still fund the site characterization and the study activities of the permanent repository. But the estimate for funding interim storage, as this bill constitutes--and that comes from the Congressional Budget Office--in the first 5 years is $2.3 billion. If you add that to the cost of what we are currently expending, an amount of about $380 million a year--that is the total we are spending right now--in the next couple of years you are going to have to have $1 billion by the fiscal year 1999--that is $1 billion--to fund the current operation of an interim storage facility and the high-level nuclear waste repository proposed at Yucca Mountain. 
It is pretty clear what this is all about. This is an interim storage. This is a thinly disguised attempt to establish a permanent high-level dump without any of the safeguards that are provided in the current legislation form for a permanent repository. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada has joined me. If I might inquire of him, I know that he might care to speak extensively on the transportation issue. I am prepared to do so if he cares to address another aspect of that. But I will invite his response.

Mr. BRYAN. They are. They are not motivated by any political, geographic, sectional, or partisan bias. They are chosen because they have the preeminent qualifications. I believe the senior Senator was off the floor when I made the observation, we have had two successive technical review boards --the one that made its report in 1996, which the Senator will recall was part of our debate. But a new board, constituted under the distinguished chairmanship of the dean, as you just referenced, they have looked at the issue and have reached the same conclusion. 
So, here you have a board of preeminent scientists examining the issue in 1996 and they reached the conclusion which you have just declared, namely that it is unnecessary, there is no advantage to it, indeed it is bad public policy. And, now the 1997 board, essentially consisting of new members, but equally eminent and distinguished scientists, has reached the same conclusion.

Mr. BRYAN. I think that is absolutely essential. And that is one thing that has beleaguered this legislation, dating back to the 1982 act. 
As the Senator from Nevada knows, because of the nuclear utilities' constant driving, pushing, insisting upon unrealistic deadlines, trying to shortcut science, this act has faced a considerable series of failures. And, as the board has pointed out from time to time, this is not something that you can rush. Indeed, it is something that needs to be very carefully reviewed. And because there is this constant pressure by the nuclear lobby to constrict the timelines, to shorten all of the opportunities for public comment, this legislation, and S. 104, would certainly fit within the same category--is not going to enjoy public confidence. 
Indeed, the very point that the Senator has made on many occasions on the floor is true, that the 1998 timeframe, which has been invoked by the proponents of S. 104 as if it were a date carved in stone, attested to by all of the deities, is, in fact, a deadline which the scientific community urged not to be placed in the legislation for the very reason the Senator inquired of the junior Senator from Nevada, the timeline was unrealistic. 
So, now, in effect they are using their argument of 1998 to, in effect, bootstrap their argument that 1998 will come and there will be no permanent resolution to it, and, therefore, we need this ill-conceived proposal that is before us.

Mr. BRYAN. I cannot, and, in point of fact, every nationally recognized environmental group that I can think of has indicated its strong opposition to this legislation as being unsound environmental policy. I think the point that the Senator from Nevada makes is a good point. Frequently, in what I would refer to most respectfully and charitably as convoluted logic, I have heard S. 104 characterized as an important piece of environmental legislation. That would give new meaning to environmental legislation. No environmental organization, as the senior Senator points out, supports this legislation and, again, for the basic reason that it is unnecessary and it is bad policy. It simply is not good policy.

Mr. BRYAN. I do, indeed. It was made in 1980. Neither the senior Senator from Nevada nor the junior Senator from Nevada were 
Members of this body or of the other one at that time. But then, as now, the nuclear utilities were urging the Congress to adopt interim storage, they then were called away from reactor storage. The statements were made during the floor debate that if this were, in fact, not done, that within the next 3 years, by 1983, nuclear utilities would have to close down and there would be brownouts. 
As the senior Senator from Nevada knows, that was 1980. In a sense, if you took the date off that legislation and inserted the words `interim storage' for `AFR,' it would be identical to the context of the debate. 
If the senior Senator from Nevada will indulge me for a moment, this is what was said by the then chairman of the Energy Committee, Mr. Johnston, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana: 
Mr. President, this bill-- 
Referring to the AFR legislation-- deals comprehensively with the problem of civilian nuclear waste. It is an urgent problem-- 
Sounds somewhat familiar, does it not? Mr. President, for this Nation. It is urgent, first, because we are running out of reactor space at reactors for the storage of the fuel, and if we do not build what we call away-from-reactor storage and begin that soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors in this country as soon as 1983. . . . 
I say to my friend from Nevada, that is, in essence, the debate that we heard in 1996. Just substitute a date and put it 3 or 4 years into the future. Those are the opening comments made by the chairman of the Energy Committee that we just heard. This is the nuclear utility refrain. It has become kind of a mantra, their Holy Grail, and, in point of fact, as the senior Senator from Nevada well knows, that is simply not the case. That is scare tactics; that is hysteria.

Mr. BRYAN. That is absolutely correct. There are a number of utilities that do it. One is just about 40 miles from the Nation's Capital. It is authorized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. So this is not a proposal that originates from those of us in this body, it is a scientifically accepted alternative that is available onsite storage which provides a 100-year storage option without, as the senior Senator from Nevada correctly points out, the risk involved in transportation and handling. 
I might just add parenthetically, with all the talk about the casks that are going to be used to be shipped across the country, those casks have not yet been designed and licensed.

Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, the junior Senator from Nevada has been criticized and taken to task somewhat because he has referred to this legislation as a `mobile Chernobyl.' In that criticism, it has been said, `Look, what happened at Chernobyl is a different situation entirely. There you had a reactor explode. This is not going to explode.' I concede that there are differences in terms of causation, but the results are equally devastating. 
We are talking about the shipment of 85,000 metric tons of nuclear waste. That would involve, as has been estimated, about 15,638 shipments--6,217 by truck, roughly 9,421 by rail. 
So we are looking at about 15,638 to roughly 17,000 shipments. 
Each of those truck casks would weigh 25 tons. Each rail cask would weigh 125 tons. One rail cask--one rail cask--carries the long-lived radiological equivalent of 200 Hiroshima bombs--200. 
So when I use the `mobile Chernobyl' analogy, the risk to Nevadans, the risk to Americans, if indeed a rail cask ruptured as a result of an accident and radiation was released, it would be a mobile Chernobyl because the spread of radioactivity and the resultant contamination that results as a consequence could be widespread. 
I would simply point out to those who are so sanguine about transportation that we are daily reminded that human error--the chairman of the Energy Committee pointed out that Chernobyl was a product of human error. Indeed, Madam President, I suspect that a great many of our accidents, maybe even a majority of them, are a product of human error. We see that every time there is a major rail collision or a train that is derailed as a consequence of some neglect in trackage. We have certainly seen it in the context of terrorist activities of late. 
But the National Environmental Law Center provides that EPA data analysis shows that 7,959 accidents occurred during the transportation of toxic chemicals from 1988 to 1992. The American Petroleum Institute tells us that heavy truck accidents occur approximately six times for each million miles traveled with thousands of truck shipments. This means that at least 15 such accidents could be expected each year. 
So the risks are considerable in terms of this transportation, all of which are unnecessary. It is not necessary or advisable or prudent or sound policy to do so. 
This is frequently characterized as a Nevada battle. But let me just say, fairly recently there has been a proposal to move the nuclear waste from a port in Oakland through Nevada and into Idaho. It has generated a considerable amount of controversy, not only in my own State, but in California. I believe that those who are watching across the Nation should be aware of the fact that Nevadans are not the only ones who are placed at risk by this ill-conceived proposal. 
The shipment routes involve 43 different States, and 51 million Americans live within 1 mile of either the rail or highway corridor routes. 
On this chart that we are exhibiting, the highway corridors are depicted in red, the rail routes are depicted in blue. With the kinds of massive shipments we are talking about--125 tons by rail, 25 tons by each truck cask--you could only use the major corridor routes. You would not use some back road or unimproved surface. You would need a full-scale transportation route. 
With all the potential for accident, with all the potential for some serious, unintended, unavoidable consequence, we risk the lives of 51 million Americans to satisfy the request of a single industry in America--the nuclear utility industry. They are the only ones that bring us to the floor to debate this issue today. As my senior colleague pointed out, they were the ones in 1980 that brought it to the floor. They were the ones that brought it to the floor in 1996. And if we are successful, as I believe that we will be in 1997 in preventing this legislation from being enacted into law, based upon a carefully considered Presidential position that he will veto such legislation, I would predict that they will be back here in 1998, 1999, and the year 2000 because this is something that they covet and that is a priority for them. 
So the transportation issue, of which we will comment more during the course of the debate tomorrow, is a consideration that affects 51 million Americans in 43 different States. As they say, you cannot get there from here. You have to take that lethal waste across the heart of America. Most of this waste--most of this waste--being east of the Mississippi River will involve transportation over literally thousands of rail or highway miles. 
Let me briefly comment on a couple of other points. The 
chairman of the Energy Committee pointed out that there is a lawsuit that was filed. He said, as others have said, that it requires that the Department of Energy must take possession of nuclear waste that is stored throughout the reactor sites by 1998 and, if we do not do so, that all kinds of horrendous consequences will occur. 
First, let me point out that the lawsuit was decided last year prior to the vote that we took on S. 1936, which is the predecessor to S. 104 and essentially in the significant aspects is virtually identical. So this is not a new development. 
But I think it is important to comment because the utilities have sought to obfuscate the issue and have given the impression that, indeed, in 1998 there will be a series of Department of Energy trucks or vans or rail cars that must back up to every reactor site in America and begin to load those on board and that, lo and behold, if they do not have an interim storage facility, these vehicles will be traveling endlessly for all time and in perpetuity. 
Nonsense. The lawsuit did conclude that the Department of Energy has an obligation, a legal responsibility. And you look to what the remedy is in the contracts. 
In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted by the Congress, signed into law by President Reagan. In that act it required utilities to enter into contracts with the Department of Energy. And all the utilities that are part of this debate have done so. 
When you look at the contract, there are two provisions, two provisions that specifically deal with this issue. 
I again remind my friends that 1998 was not a date sanctified by the scientific community. That was a date the utilities insisted upon. The Department of Energy and others argued that that date was unrealistic. `We're not going to be able to reach that date,' they said. But the utilities said, `No. 1998, we want that.' That is what the law reflected. 
But in the contract that was required to be entered into with each of the utilities with the Department of Energy, there were two provisions. Both of these provisions are contained in article 9. 
What it said is this: In anticipation that the 1998 date may not be fulfilled, it indicated that if the delays were unavoidable by the Department of Energy, that is, if the delays were beyond their control, that there was no culpability. Then the remedy that was provided was simply to reschedule the delivery dates. It makes some sense. 
The other provision that is applicable--and I am sure the utilities will urge this point of view--is, indeed, there is culpability on the part of the Department of Energy. As a result of their culpability, it would be classified under the provisions of the contract as an `avoidable' delay. That, too, is part of article 9, section B. 
The contract remedy is, in the event of any delay in the delivery, acceptance or transport caused by circumstances within the reasonable control of the Department of Energy or their respective contractors or suppliers, the charges and schedules specified by this contract will be equitably adjusted to reflect any estimated additional cost. That strikes me as being reasonable. 
I had occasion in many years past to practice law, not nuclear utility law or environmental law, but what this says is that, look, if the Department of Energy is found to have been negligent in moving the process forward, the utility is entitled to an adjustment of what they are paying into the nuclear waste trust fund based upon additional costs that are being incurred. Indeed, that is not a novel concept. 
When this Senator first came to the Senate in 1989, and in each session thereafter, joined by my senior colleague from Nevada, we have offered legislation that does indeed provide that the utilities would be entitled to an offset or compensation for the additional expense that they may incur as a result of this 1998 
deadline being unattainable. 
So there is no great mystery about the lawsuit. It changes nothing in the debate that we have, nothing whatsoever, and should not be used as a basis for supporting the legislation that is currently before us. 
Finally, let me make just one additional comment that the senior Senator from Nevada addressed. That is that this legislation is not going to become law. 
The President of the United States, as he did in 1996, indicated that this is bad policy, and following the advice and counsel of the scientific community--the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board concluded that it was unnecessary, unwise, and indeed there is no necessity for this, no safety is to be gained by this massive shipment of 85,000 metric tons of waste. This is a scientific body that concluded that in 1996, and although the board is newly constituted with a new chairman and many new members, it reached the same conclusion in 1997, this very year, in testimony that verified that interim storage is not necessary. So the President, following the wise counsel of those who have examined this from a scientific and objective point of view, has indicated, as shown in testimony before the Senate Energy Committee, that this legislation will be vetoed if indeed it should reach his desk. 
We will have much more to say about this issue as we debate it during the course of the next week or so. We will point out with greater particularity a number of the issues that we have touched upon lightly today. I just hope, for my colleagues who are watching and their staffs, that we not be misled. This is legislation that is a carbon copy of the legislation that was debated in S. 1936 in the last session of the Congress. 
I yield the floor. 
Madam President, I see no one else is on the floor seeking recognition. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, yesterday in the Senate Banking Committee American consumers were dealt a major setback. The committee was expected to vote out legislation that would have ended a practice that costs hundreds of thousands of homeowners millions of dollars per year. 
The Banking Committee was scheduled to vote out S. 318, the Homeowners' Protection Act of 1997 which is sponsored by Senators D'Amato, Dodd, Domenici, and myself. This bill would outlaw the practice of overcharging homeowners for private mortgage insurance they no longer need. 
Unfortunately, Chairman D'Amato was forced to cancel the markup because a number of Members put the interest of a small, yet highly profitable, industry over the public's interest. To make matters worse, this industry is clearly taking advantage of millions of Americans in an unconscionable manner. 
The opponents of Chairman D'Amato's legislation argue that the bill places too heavy a burden on this one industry. I do not share their opinion and believe the interests of millions of American homeowners should be put ahead of an industry that is clearly taking advantage of these same homeowners. 
Those protecting the industry need to heed the advice of one of their colleagues, Congressman James Hansen. Let me share from Congressman Hansen's observations: 
As a small businessman for most of my life . . . I have learned that if an industry polices itself, the government should not interfere. I firmly believe that the government should stay out of the private marketplace. However, when an industry does not follow even its own guidelines, I believe it is our responsibility to draw that line. 
Now that comes, Mr. President, from one of our more conservative colleagues who serves in the other body. 
I commend Chairman D'Amato for his leadership in introducing this important legislation that will affect millions of homeowners. Let me indicate how important that is and how many people are affected. 
In 1996, of the 2.1 million home mortgages that were insured, more than 1 million required private mortgage insurance. One industry group has estimated that at least 250,000 homeowners are either overpaying for this insurance or paying when it is totally unnecessary. At an average monthly cost of $30 to $100, unnecessary insurance premiums are costing homeowners thousands of dollars every year. 
Now, clearly, private mortgage insurance serves a useful purpose in the initial mortgage lending process. It enables many home buyers who cannot afford the standard 20-percent downpayment on a home mortgage to achieve a dream of home ownership. While private mortgage insurance protects lenders against default on a loan, there comes a time when that protection afforded to the lender becomes unnecessary, and the point, it seems to me, is reached when the homeowner's equity investment in the residence gives the lender sufficient assurance against default. 
The comfort level generally within the industry has been 20 percent. So it stands to reason that PMI is not necessary for risk management and prudent underwriting procedures once the homeowner has reached the 20-percent equity mark. Therefore, borrowers who amass equity equal to 20 percent of their homes' original value should be treated in the same way as borrowers who are able to make a 20-percent downpayment or more at the outset of the loan. 
The Homeowners' Protection Act of 1997 would ensure that existing and future homeowners would not continue to pay for private insurance when it is no longer necessary. Specifically, this legislation would inform the borrower at closing about private mortgage insurance and outline how the servicer of the loan will automatically cancel the mortgage insurance, assuming the transaction is not exempt from cancellation when the loan balance reaches 80 percent of the original value. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt that private mortgage insurance is an important tool in the American system of mortgage finance. However, retaining private mortgage insurance beyond its usefulness to the homeowner is a practice that should be ended. The Homeowners' Protection Act will prevent present and future homeowners from paying for private mortgage insurance that is no longer needed. This proposal will end the unfair practice and protect the consumer. 
This legislation is supported by almost every consumer group, but also leading industry groups such as the American Bankers Association, the National Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Homebuilders. 
I urge my colleagues to move forward on this important piece of consumer legislation and put the industry's objections below the overriding public interest. We must lift this unfair burden from American homeowners. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my senior colleague from West Virginia for his courtesy. I yield the floor.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death to persons under 35, and the fifth leading cause of death in the Nation overall. Unintentional injuries kill more children over age one than any disease. 
It is astounding that there are an average 21,400 deaths and 29.4 million injuries each year related to consumer products under the jurisdiction of a small, but effective, Federal agency--the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission [CPSC]. The CPSC finds that deaths, injuries, and property damage associated with consumer products cost the Nation $200 billion annually. 
In 1996, the CPSC negotiated 375 recalls involving over 85 million products that presented a significant risk of injury to the public. However, despite recall notices and public warnings, many old hazardous products such as bean bag chairs, wooden bunk beds, mini-hammocks and cribs--with the potential to seriously injure or kill a child--remain in homes, flea markets, garage sales or in second hand stores. 
To rid consumers' homes of hazardous products, the Consumer Product Safety Commission under the leadership of Chairman Ann Brown, on April 16 of this year, will launch `Recall Round-Up Day' by broadcasting a video to television stations across the country. The video will have examples of hazardous products that might be in consumers homes, such as the following: 
Bean bag chairs that can present a choking or suffocation hazard to children. Some bean bag chairs can be unzipped and children can then inhale the small pellets of foam filling. The CPSC is aware of at least five deaths and at least 23 other incidents in which children inhaled or ingested bean bag filling. In the past 2 years, CPSC obtained the recall of more than 10 million bean bag chairs. 
Wooden bunk beds that can strangle young children. Since 1990, CPSC has received reports of 32 children who died after becoming caught in bunk beds with improper openings in the top bunk structure. Since 1995, CPSC has obtained the recall of approximately half a million hazardous bunk beds. 
Mini-hammocks that can strangle children. CPSC has received reports of 12 children, ages 5 to 17 years, who became entangled and died when using mini-hammocks without spreader bars. Last year, CPSC obtained the recall of over three million minihammocks. 
Old cribs that can choke or suffocate a small child. Cribs having more than 2 3/8 inches between crib slats, corner posts, or cut outs on the headboard or footboard present suffocation and strangulation hazard to babies. Each year, 50 babies die when they become trapped between broken crib parts or in cribs with older, unsafe designs. 
CPSC is enlisting the help of State and local officials, as well as national and State health and safety organizations, in connection with State and local governments throughout the Nation, to publicize a safety campaign, distribute information about these and other hazardous products in the home. In some States, recalled products will be rounded up and brought to a central location for disposal. 
I commend Chairman Ann Brown and the CPSC for taking this bold action. My State Office in Las Vegas is working with the State chapter of the National SafeKids Campaign, Sunrise Children's Hospital, and the Clark County Health Dept. to organize local events throughout the State for Recall Roundup. We will publicize the campaign through the media to reach the general public. Special efforts will be directed to reach child care providers and especially new parents. The sellers of used articles that could include recalled products will also be alerted to the hazards that used cribs, bunk beds, minihammocks and bean bag chairs could present to prevent the resale of these items.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend for his courtesy and his most generous remarks and to say, again, as I have on previous occasions, that I am very pleased to be a supporter of this constitutional amendment that he has authored each and every Congress that I have been here since 1989. I believe what we are discussing today is central to the issue of meaningful campaign reform, and I want to publicly commend him for his leadership and express my admiration for him and my conviction that I share with him that this is the essence of what we need to do. 
Let me just say that I believe that the most corrosive force in our political culture today, and what lies at the heart of many problems in our political system, is the amount of money required to run a campaign for elective office. Money has become the dominant factor in deciding who runs, who wins and, too often, who has the influence and power in the halls of Government. 
Mr. President, I don't say that with a partisan vein. That is true with respect to the system that we are all a part of--Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike. 
Every year, the expense of campaigning increases, and the pressure to seek financial support, wherever it can be found, intensifies. Clearly, good people are trapped in a system where the amount of money needed to run a campaign can overshadow their views and the issues. Too often, candidates are forced to spend as much time raising money as going out and meeting the voters or to develop responsible solutions to the critical issues that face our society. 
It is a fact that all of us would acknowledge that every night here in Washington someone has a political fundraiser, either a Democrat or a Republican running for office, running for reelection. 
And much like an ever-escalating arms race, the cost of Senate campaigns have increased sixfold over the last 20 years, from $609,100 in 1976, to $3.6 million in 1996. 
The average cost for a winning House candidate during that same period of time increased from $87,000 in 1976, to $661,000 in 1996. 
And between 1992 and 1996, fundraising by political parties increased 73 percent. 
Simply put, Mr. President, there is too much money in the political process. 
Mr. President, the recently concluded Presidential and congressional campaigns were the most costly ever in American political history, with combined amounts of more than $2 billion. The two parties raised $263.5 million in soft money in the 1996 campaign, almost three times the amount raised in the 1992 election. 
Unless the rules are changed, candidates and their parties will continue to pursue the money chase and the amount of money involved in future campaigns will continue to grow exponentially. 
Mr. President, I might make an aside here, if the distinguished primary sponsor has a moment for me to expand for just a moment.

Mr. BRYAN. And I say that we all lament the declining participation in the political electoral process in America. The 1996 election turnout was said to be the lowest since 1920. I would offer this as at least a significant contributing factor. There is no question the folks back home are pretty upset with those of us who serve in the Congress. I believe that that is their thought, seeing each party and each of us who are part of this system--I want to be clear, Mr. President, I include myself as being part of this system--who are forced to go out there and raise these inordinate, scandalous amounts of money to be competitive--to be competitive. 
In the State of Nevada, it was about $3.5 million for my last campaign for reelection to the U.S. Senate. They see this. And I think it has engendered a sense of public cynicism that all of this money that is involved--I believe in the public mind, they frequently link the big money, the big contributors to the political system that we have today. And because most of them are not in the category of being big money contributors, they have been turned off. The system no longer works for them, the system is no longer responsive to their needs, is their perception. 
So, as a result, I hear good people, Democrats and Republicans alike, in increasing and in alarming numbers saying, `I'm not going to vote. I'm not going to vote.' I do not agree with that proposition and get into spirited discussions. `What difference does my vote make? Look, the folks who have got the money, they're the ones who really control the electoral process in America today. Why should I get involved?' And I must say, as we see these campaign expenditures continue to mount, I believe that we provide the evidence for their rising levels of cynicism. 
I was a young man in the State legislature in the 1970's, and the centerpiece to the Watergate reform was, as the distinguished junior Senator from South Carolina has pointed out, the concept of controlling and limiting the amount of money that is spent in running for office. 
The other provisions which continue to survive--individual campaign contribution limits and the Federal Election Commission disclosures, the distinction between soft money and hard money--which are still very much a part of the political environment, have survived, to some extent, successive legal challenges in the courts. 
But the centerpiece, limiting the amount of money spent for running for office, has essentially been eviscerated by the Buckley versus Valeo decision. I was in the legislature and responding to some of the reforms that came out of the Watergate Congress. We adopted, in the State of Nevada, a series of campaign limitations. Those, too, fell by the wayside by the Supreme Court's decision in the Buckley versus Valeo case in 1976, which I believe to be an ill-considered decision, but which, as everybody in this Chamber knows, essentially equated political expenditures on behalf of the individual candidate as being tantamount to free speech, and any attempt to limit the amount of money that a candidate can spend is constitutionally infirm. 
I must say, recent decisions in the Court, and the recent Colorado decision, give us no hope to believe that the Court is about to reconsider its position. It is my humble opinion that the Colorado case has made matters even more difficult and has continued to shred what vestiges remain of a comprehensive and, I think, carefully thought-out campaign finance reform legislation in the aftermath of the Watergate. 
Amending the Constitution is not something that should be undertaken lightly. That admonition is frequently given by our colleagues. And they are right. We ought not just to do that. We ought not to think of the Constitution as a rough draft that we can improve upon with a wholesale series of amendments. I agree with that admonition. 
But I would say, Mr. President, with great respect, that our forefathers could never have anticipated the consequences of the electoral system they put in place, with all of its checks and balances and with the genius that we all revere, Democrat and Republican alike, that this has increasingly become a money chase. So it seems to me we have two choices: To either do nothing and to allow a situation which I believe to be appalling to get measurably worse, or we can take corrective action. 
The American people want us to take corrective action. The American people do not fully understand that it is the Court's decision itself that prevents us from legislative action to impose a limit on the amount of money as candidates we spend in running for the Congress and in other elective offices in America. 
I believe one of the most important steps we can take to restore public confidence in our political process is to pass the amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor with my friend and colleague from South Carolina, and to give the Congress and to give State legislatures power that they thought that they possessed in the 1970's and to impose limitations on the amount of money that is spent in running for public office. 
Individuals who want to run for Congress and other elective offices ought to be able to run on the basis of the ideas that they represent, the vitality that they bring to the process, not as is so often the case, `Can I raise $3 million or $4 million or $10 million or, in some instances, $20 million?' 
Unless we can find a way to limit the amount of money spent on Federal campaigns and place a greater emphasis on getting support from the people back home that we represent, we will fall short of real reform. Any serious reform proposal must start with the constitutional amendment to allow the States and Congress to craft measures that would take Government out of the pockets of the special interests and back in the hands of the American people who we represent. 
Mr. President, I am not unmindful of the fact that our task is difficult. Many of our colleagues do not agree. But I must say that as I talk with my own constituents, I think there is an overwhelming interest across a broad spectrum, Republican, Democrat, liberal and conservative, to do something about this political process that we are all a part of. 
In the Nevada legislature this year there is a proposal that will require further disclosure on the amount of campaign contributions. That, so far, the Supreme Court has said is legal, and that enjoys bipartisan support and is likely to pass overwhelmingly. 
A ballot proposition on the Nevada ballot this past fall which sought to further limit the amounts of individual campaign contributions in statewide and local races passed by 71 percent. 
I understand if you ask people about things that concern them most in life, they are not going to list campaign finance reform. They are interested in crime, in schools, in drugs, and those kinds of issues, which I understand. But I have yet to be in an audience of any size in which you ask people about this system that we are part of, and they do not say, `I hope that you will do something to reform it. 
Campaign finance reform is something that you should undertake.' They understand, as do each of us in this Chamber, it will not come about without bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, let me again commend my friend and colleague, who has really been the laboring force on behalf of this constitutional amendment, for his courage and tenacity and, I think, the wisdom of his proposal. I am proud to support in this Congress, as I have previous Congresses, such a constitutional amendment. 
I thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to speak, as I need to return to a committee hearing.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for his thoughtful comments. 
Mr. President, let me just say, by way of prefacing my comments, that I have enjoyed being a participant in this debate. And I have enjoyed the manner in which my colleague, the distinguished Democratic floor leader--who has a very different point of view from that which Senator Hatch and I share--has conducted himself and the arguments that he has made and the responses by the senior Senator from Utah. It seems to me that that is what this institution is all about--the ability to conduct an honest debate on the floor with different points of view being expressed. 
Hopefully from that collision of different points of view will emerge a public policy which will enable this country to move forward on the correct course. 
Mr. President, the Senate will soon cast a historic vote to decide whether Senate Joint Resolution 1 should become a part of our Constitution. This may very well be the most significant vote the Senate will cast in this session of the Congress. If we are successful, it could dramatically alter the future of our country in a very positive way. I renew my request and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of a balanced budget amendment for the sake of future generations. 
The Senate has been debating Senate Joint Resolution 1 for an entire month, and just as it should when we are considering an amendment to our Constitution, the debate has been thoughtful and thorough. We have debated serious and credible amendments on a wide range of topics including the treatment of Social Security and capital budgeting. The Senate debated these issues and after debate decided to leave Senate Joint Resolution 1 intact and rejected each of those proffered amendments. I supported several of the amendments, but it is now time to put the debate on those amendments behind us and pass the amendment. While some of us may have felt that the amendment could be improved with certain change, all of us must realize that we are better off with this amendment than with the status quo. 
I would like to take a moment to recognize the two of my colleagues who have spent more time in the Chamber debating this than any of us, and that would be the senior Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], and the senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd]. These men have served in this institution with distinction for a combined 60 years. During this past month, each of them has treated us to his own brand of eloquence in espousing his point of view. It has been a delight for those of us who are privileged to serve in this institution to hear and to share in that debate. No one who has observed the floor proceedings can question the depth of their sincerity about their feelings. It is a tribute to the democratic process to see this kind of debate occur in this Chamber. 
Mr. President, amending our Constitution is the most significant action the Senate can take, and it should not be undertaken lightly. In this case I believe the future of our country is at stake--the ability of our children and our children's children to have the same economic choices in their time that our generation has enjoyed. 
We are constantly reminded that everyone is for a balanced Federal budget but not everyone is for a constitutional amendment which puts that process in place and helps us to achieve that goal. On its face, this position appears to me to be inconsistent. If you are for a balanced budget, it would seem the more logical course of action would be to support a mechanism that would help to facilitate the outcome. I believe the amendment accomplishes that purpose. The amendment itself is very straightforward. Congress may not let spending exceed revenues in a given year unless a 60-percent supermajority of those elected both in the House and the Senate vote to permit a specific amount of deficit spending. While this does not guarantee balanced budgets, it will, in my judgment, make it more difficult to authorize deficit spending if this process, a constitutional amendment, is in place. 
My experience as Governor of Nevada convinces me of the merits of this process. With a State constitution that requires a balanced budget, those of us who were privileged to serve as the chief executive of our States were forced to make hard choices in spending and on revenues, particularly during the period of economic slowdown during the 1980's. The year that I assumed the Governorship of Nevada, January 1983, we were concerned that the State payroll would not clear because budget revenues had fallen far short of their original and earlier projections. Yet, with that hammer of a constitutional amendment in place in our own State, it would have been much more difficult, much more difficult to have ignored the constitutional mandate to balance the budget. Therefore, both the Governor and the State legislature were able to resist the pressure of those good people in our State urging spending for programs that many of us were for. 
The point I think, Mr. President, is the hard choice. It is the nature of those who are advocates for these programs, good people all, to urge more spending than they know a Governor at the State level or the legislature at the State level can approve, and it becomes the responsibility of those of us who have served at the State level as Governors to submit a balanced budget and for State legislatures to require a balanced budget. 
We did not have the luxury of avoiding the painful cuts by running deficits. That would have been the easy way out and, unfortunately, the way the Federal Government has chosen to proceed in 59 of the last 67 years. 
My experience as a Senator has also taught me how difficult those budget choices can be. The process is essentially the same, with a much greater magnitude, and while we have made impressive progress in reducing the deficit over the last 4 years--$107 billion in the last fiscal year, projected at one 
time to be $292 billion--the President and Congress can justifiably take pride in what they have accomplished, but balancing the budget by the year 2002 will require sustained discipline, the kind of discipline that has not characterized our actions either from the White House or from the Congress. If we are successful, we will have accomplished something that has occurred only once in the last 33 years. 
After 2002, the deficit picture gets worse, and gets dramatically worse, when the baby-boom generation, a tidal wave, begins to impact the programs that we have put in place for the elderly in America. Without the balanced budget amendment, the temptation will always be there, the temptation to avoid making the hard choices. 
History shows us all too well that at the Federal level both the White House and the Congress, without reference to partisan affiliation, has tended to take the easy road. It is true that Senate Joint Resolution 1 does not guarantee that we will not take the easy road, but I submit it would make it much harder to do so. 
Many of my colleagues who have indicated they plan to vote against Senate Joint Resolution 1 have stated their concerns over not excluding Social Security from the budget calculations. While I agree that excluding Social Security would be in our long-term best interests, I believe they are mistaken if they believe that Social Security will be better off without the balanced budget. I believe our best option would be to exclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment, and I have so voted. But our next best option is enacting the balanced budget amendment as it appears in the Chamber today and as we will vote on it this afternoon. Our worst option is to preserve or to retain the status quo, and that is to do nothing, to reject this proposed balanced budget amendment. 
No one disputes that a balanced budget amendment will help end our string of deficits. Some will argue that we do not need it to achieve our goal, but no one says it will not help. And while the amendment does not mandate a balanced budget, it does, in my opinion, make it more likely. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to conclude that a balanced budget amendment will lead to less deficit spending than if we fail to enact the balanced budget amendment. 
If a balanced budget amendment will help cut deficit spending, what will the effects of less deficit spending be on programs that we all support, like Social Security? Every dollar of deficit spending that occurs now is a dollar that will not be available to pay Social Security retirees when they need it. And even worse, we lose not only that dollar but we lose the interest that we pay on it, which multiplies rapidly with the magic of compounding. 
The best example of this can be illustrated by looking at where we were in 1980. If we had adopted a balanced budget amendment in 1980, 17 years ago, and had not increased the national debt from about $1 trillion to more than $5 trillion today, we would not have to cut a single dollar from this year's budget to achieve balance. In other words, we would be in surplus if we did not have to make the interest payments on the deficits that were run up over the last 20 years. 
I do not want Senators years from now to say, `Gee, if they had only adopted a balanced budget amendment in 1997, we would not have added trillions more to our national debt. We would not have added billions more in interest payments in servicing that debt. We would not have to be cutting the worthwhile spending programs because of the larger national debt.' 
Mr. President, the trend line is both alarming and disturbing. Since 1980, the percentage of our budget dedicated to servicing the debt has risen from 7 to 15 percent. This year's budget contains a line item of $245 billion for interest payment on the national debt. That is the net interest payment. In other words, almost $1 out of every $6 in our budget goes to servicing the $5.3 trillion national debt. 
Worse than that, if the interest we earn from Social Security and other trust funds which is supposed to be saved to be paid out in future years is excluded, the gross interest we owe is really $350 billion. 
No one claims running a Federal budget deficit actually helps Social Security or other Federal program over the long haul. Congressman Joe Kennedy who is an undisputed champion of social programs to help the poor makes this point very eloquently. He maintains that deficit spending has not helped, but has hurt, spending for social programs. 
Every dollar that must go to servicing the national debt is a dollar that cannot go to school lunch programs, paving roads, or repairing our neglected national parks. Interest payments are now the second largest Federal spending item following Social Security in our budget. 
I must ask my colleagues who support taking Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment, as I do, whether their interests are not better served by a constitutional amendment that helps facilitate a balanced budget. 
This is now my 9th year in the Senate. I do not recall a single Senator getting up and offering a budget that excluded Social Security from the budget calculations. For those who profess to feel so strongly about Social Security that they cannot vote for a balanced budget amendment, why have they never attempted to exclude Social Security from past budgets? 
While it is wrong to use Social Security to mask the true size of the deficit, including Social Security, that is no reason to vote against a balanced budget amendment, in my view. 
The greatest threat to Social Security is the debt. There are real and tangible benefits for every American family if we balance the Federal budget. 
Interest rates are estimated to be 2 percent higher because of the deficit. The average price of a new home is $37,000 more because we can't balance the budget. A student loan is estimated to be almost $2,000 more expensive and a new car $1,000 more expensive because we haven't balanced the budget. 
Under current trends, a child born today will have to pay $180,000 over their lifetime to service the national debt. What kind of burden are we passing on to future generations? 
Given the overwhelming benefits of a balanced Federal budget, I strongly believe this country needs a balanced budget amendment to help us achieve this goal. Yes, there are some risks that a minority of our legislators will act irresponsibly--but that can happen today if 41 Senators choose to filibuster. Therefore, I believe we gain the benefits of greater pressure to achieve a balanced budget without incurring additional risks. 
We have a historic opportunity this afternoon to change the future course of our country in a very positive way. If we fail, I am afraid we will look back 20 years from now and be even further in debt, with fewer economic choices for that generation, and regret that we had not taken this important step today. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 1. This vote will be your legacy to your children and to our country's future economic well-being.

 Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to newspaper publisher Robert Sanford, who is celebrating his 40th anniversary as owner of the Mason Valley News. Mr. Sanford's tireless stewardship has helped make the Mason Valley News one of the finest newspapers of its kind and a model for journalistic integrity. 
The Mason Valley News is a weekly newspaper that serves northern Nevada. Since Mr. Sanford became owner of the newspaper in 1957, the paper has quadrupled its circulation and tripled its size--all while remaining true to its roots. 
Mr. Sanford's newspaper career started as a printer's devil when he was just 14 years old. After World War II, where he proudly served his country for 3 years in the Army, Mr. Sanford returned home to northern Nevada and gained experience working in virtually every aspect of the newspaper business. He came to own the Mason Valley News at the age of 35. Mr. Sanford's two sons, David and James, also work for the paper. 
It is with great pride and pleasure that I congratulate Robert Sanford and the Mason Valley News on 40 years of dependability and accomplishment and I wish them the best of luck for another successful 40 years.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
I note by way of a prefacing comment the amendment that we are debating is a significant one. Obviously, there is going to be prolonged and thoughtful debate on the merits of Senate Joint Resolution 1, as is appropriate. 
I note that not all Democrats agree with the position I take in support of this amendment, and not all members of the same family agree. The very able and distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts has made an eloquent statement here just moments ago in opposition. His articulate and able nephew joined us at a press conference earlier today with equal vigor arguing for its ratification. So this will have some ramifications, I am sure, in terms of the process here in Washington.

Mr. BRYAN. I do not want to transgress and separate that wall of separation between church and state, but I think there may be a period of redemption here for those who have not yet been enlightened by our view. 
It is always a pleasure to engage the Senator from Massachusetts in conversation because I know that he advocates from a position of conviction, sincerely a colleague whom I respect even though in this particular case I find myself in disagreement with his position. 
Mr. President, this debate will climax later this month when the Senate tries to muster the 67 votes necessary to make this the 28th amendment to the Constitution. The outcome of this vote will have historic consequences which will significantly affect this country for decades to come. If we are successful in getting this amendment added to our Constitution, it will be this Congress' legacy to the history books and to our children and our grandchildren. 
The President spoke eloquently last evening in his State of the Union Address. I have known the President for at least 15 years, when he and I served as chief executive officers of our respective States, and I have never heard him speak more eloquently. I believe it is the most eloquent of the State of the Union Messages that I have heard as a Member of this body. He spoke at considerable length about our children and the 21st century. We are part of the 20th century. As he pointed out, those who are born this year will have little or no memory of the century that has been the governing influence in the lives of every Member of this institution and those who report our actions for this generation. 
I believe with equal sincerity that the action we take on this amendment is, likewise, for our children and their legacy so that they may have the same economic opportunities we have. It is my sense, and I will speak to this more in just a moment, that we foreclose and mortgage their future if we do not arrest a trend that has been institutionalized with both Democratic and Republican administrations and with Democratic and Republican Congresses. 
As I commented earlier this month at a press conference with my able colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, both the White House and the Congress have supported a balanced budget. Democrats and Republicans in the Congress support a balanced budget. It has become the Holy Grail, if you will, of American political strategy to reach a balanced budget. Suffice it to say, our track record has not been particularly impressive. In 59 of the last 67 years, we have failed to balance the budget, and as a consequence these numbers are staggering. I want to talk to that issue a little bit more in a moment. 
I do not underestimate the seriousness of an undertaking to amend the Constitution. We have only done so 27 times in our history, and so we should approach this carefully and analytically. This will and should be a lengthy debate, with serious consideration given to legitimate points of view, but in the final analysis I believe it is imperative that Congress send to the States some form of a balanced budget amendment. Other approaches have been tried and failed, but for the future economic well-being of our country, our children, and our 
grandchildren, we must take this step. 
The wording of the resolution is straightforward and the text is barely two pages long. Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, total Federal spending must not exceed total Federal revenues for each year unless a 60-percent supermajority of those elected in both the House and the Senate vote to allow the Congress to authorize a specific amount of deficit spending. 
While the wording is straightforward, the significance in terms of its impact on our country cannot be overestimated. Balanced budget amendments are not alien to our Government. In fact, almost all States have balanced budget requirements either in their constitutions or in their statutes. 
As Governor of Nevada, I was required to balance the State's budget. It was not always an easy task, particularly during the economic slowdown of the early 1980's which affected my own State of Nevada and many other States. The year that I was elected Governor, in 1982, the recession had reached its low point in my State, and in January 1983, as I assumed office, we were not sure in that first month whether we could handle the payroll for State government. It was close. It was nip and tuck. 
It is always the lot of those who seek support for programs, many of which I support, many of which the Members of this Chamber are supportive of, it is always the nature of those groups to ask more than they know you can provide, and Governors have the responsibility reinforced with a balanced budget provision, notwithstanding those requests and the merit of many of them, to simply say I would love to do it, I would like to do it, but we simply cannot do it because we do not have the money to do it and we have to operate within the revenue stream that we have. 
That is the way we conduct our personal affairs, in business and private life. We lack that institutional discipline, it seems to me, here at the Federal level. And I say that without respect to partisanship. That is true with Democratic and Republican administrations alike. 
My experience born out of that time is that a balanced budget requirement instills fiscal discipline in a system that is otherwise predisposed to avoid making hard, unpopular choices, and for the most part States have performed admirably when it comes to fiscal responsibility. We cannot say the same for the Federal Government in recent history. 
In our country's first 150 years, there was almost an unwritten rule that the Federal Government should balance its budget. The United States Government ran deficits during the War of 1812, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War, to name a few occasions. But in other periods the Federal Government ran surpluses to reduce its outstanding debts. On the whole, only emergencies justified running deficits. However, in the past 36 years, the Federal Government has balanced its budget only once, in fiscal year 1969, and has failed in 59 of the last 67 years. 
That is not an impressive record. None of us ought to be proud of that record. Let me emphasize, because this is bipartisan, that occurred under Republican administrations, Democrat administrations, Republican Congresses, and Democrat Congresses. So institutionally we all share the failure in being able to achieve that balanced budget. 
Since 1980, the accumulated Federal debt has skyrocketed from less than $1 trillion to over $5 trillion. That represents $20,000 for every American, man, woman, and child. This has taken place in an era when our country has not been at war and has enjoyed relatively healthy economic conditions. No one can claim national emergency necessitated running these deficits. 
Many in Washington believe there is now a true commitment to fiscal discipline. On the Federal level, in the last few years there has been some cause for optimism. For the first time since before the American Civil War, for four consecutive years, the annual deficit has declined. The President can take credit for that as well as the Congress for actions that have been taken. 
What we do not hear is that in the current budget year we are developing, the deficits will begin to rise again, and so they will in each successive year to the year 2002. That success has been achieved as a result of a number of things that we have done in the Congress and in an economy that has enjoyed a surprising long run in growth. The deficit has been cut in half from its projected level just 4 years ago and the deficit has fallen from 4.9 percent of the gross domestic product in 1992 to 1.4 percent in 1996. 
I know, and I think every Member of this Chamber knows, it is going to be extremely difficult, but we must complete the task and balance the budget by 2002. I am pleased to note and to sense a strong bipartisan will to achieve this goal. When we debate the budget resolution and 13 appropriations bills later this year, our will to achieve a balanced budget by 2002 will be sorely tested. I am optimistic, and I am hopeful we will rise to that challenge. 
If we can balance the budget by 2002, some may ask, why do we need a balanced budget constitutional amendment? The simple answer is that this amendment is in the form of an insurance policy that Congress will live up to its good intentions. The amendment will keep our feet to the fire. While I respect the good intention of Members of Congress, history has proven that in the past three-quarters of a century we have not been up to the challenge. As I indicated a moment ago, in 59 of the last 67 years, the Federal Government has spent more money than it took in. 
Additionally, since 1978, Congress has enacted five statutes requiring a balanced Federal budget--clearly good intentions. But Federal statutes have not worked, which is why I believe an amendment to the Constitution is the next logical and necessary step we must take. If we have the desire to balance the budget, why have we had so much difficulty in achieving this goal? While people in theory support a balanced budget, I am sure my colleagues share the same experience that I have had. At every townhall meeting, if asked, `Do you favor the Federal Government balancing its budget?' The answer is overwhelmingly in the affirmative. But when it comes down to specific cuts, it is interesting that that same townhall meeting will say, `But I don't want you to cut here.' And in an audience of a couple hundred people, there are probably a dozen programs that those of our constituents who come to these meetings suggest: Balance the budget but don't make any cuts in these respective programs. They, like past Congresses, shy away from the hard choices. 
Unfortunately, the consequences of failing to make the hard choices are either very subtle or are not felt for years or decades. While cuts in food stamps or home heating assistance are felt immediately and energize a specific constituency, a point or two rise in interest rates caused by deficit spending is hidden. Some of the American people have to make the connection between large Federal budget deficits and higher interest rates. These higher interest rates have a dramatic impact on the American family's bottom line. In fact, DRI-McGraw-Hill estimates that interest rates will drop by 2 percent if we balance the budget. This will save an average family $2,169 per year in mortgage interest, $180 on an auto loan, and $216 on a typical student loan. 
But the most insidious effects of deficit spending are the larger and larger burdens we pass on to the next generation. In just a decade, the deficit has gone from $8,000 for every man, woman, and child in this country to more than $20,000 this year. We are burdening future generations with the tab for our inability to bite the bullet, to make the hard choices. 
Our inability to balance the budget has had a compounding effect. Each year we fail to do so, the job becomes harder the next year, as we have to pay more to service the national debt. In the past 20 years, the percentage of our budget that goes to servicing the debt has risen from 7 to 15 percent. We lose 15 percent of our budget just paying for the excesses of the past and just the interest, none of that retiring the principal which is now approximately $5.3 trillion. 
Put another way, $1 in every $6 of our Federal budget goes to paying interest on our more than $5 trillion national debt. Before the first school lunch is paid for, before another road is paved, before much-needed repair is undertaken on our neglected National Park System, we spend in gross interest 
payments alone, $300 billion as the cost of servicing our national debt. It is the second largest Federal spending item, following Social Security, and is equal to almost one-half of our personal income taxes paid to the Federal Government. Yet we have nothing to show for it. 
While there is little disagreement on the evils of budget deficits, there is a serious disagreement and debate over whether Senate Joine Resolution 1 addresses specific concerns people have. I want to address one that is very sensitive and certainly worthy of being discussed and carefully considered, and that is whether Social Security should be included in a balanced budget amendment. 
I believe Social Security should be removed from the balanced budget amendment. I do not do this lightly, because removing the Social Security surpluses will make it more difficult in our task of balancing the budget. The surplus for 1996 was approximately $60 billion. But whether Social Security should be taken out of the balanced budget amendment depends on how you view the Social Security system. If you believe it to be a pay-as-you-go system where today's workers' payroll taxes should go to pay the benefits of today's retirees, then Social Security should remain a part of the overall budget, and that is an honest, philosophical point of view. If, however, you believe the funds being taken out of today's workers' payrolls should be set aside for their retirement, years from now, then Social Security should be taken out of budget. 
In fact, Congress has spoken on this issue and, in 1990, enacted legislation to take Social Security out of the unified budget. But my support for taking Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment is based on my conviction that we must start putting aside money for future retirees or we will face, as a country, financial calamity. The math does not work out, for there will be far too few workers to support far too many retirees when the baby boom generation retires in the next century. 
Finally, we currently have 3.2 workers for every retiree. In the year 2030, we will have only two workers for every retiree, and young people today are rightfully skeptical about what will be left to pay for their retirement. One way to restore their confidence would be to truly set aside their payroll contribution by taking it out of a balanced budget amendment. This would prohibit the Federal Government from using Social Security surpluses when it balances the budget, and Social Security would look more like a traditional retirement system. 
Over the next several weeks the Senate will engage in serious debate over the issue of excluding Social Security from a balanced budget amendment. While I support such an amendment, I believe it is vital that we pass a balanced budget amendment, even if it does not exclude Social Security. The worst thing we can do for Social Security is to fail to pass any balanced budget amendment. 
Without the fiscal discipline provided by the amendment, we will never be able to keep our budget in order. 
If we have learned nothing else from our past budget problems, it should be that putting off the solution only makes matters more difficult to rectify. A little pain now helps us to avoid a lot of pain later. The fiscal discipline of the balanced budget amendment will make it much easier for us to responsibly assure the long-term solvency of the Social Security System. The worst option for the long-term viability of Social Security, in my opinion, would be to continue with the status quo and fail to enact a balanced budget amendment. 
Let me just embellish upon that for a moment. I know that many of my colleagues will be joining me in supporting an amendment to take Social Security off budget, and I believe they are sincere in desiring to protect Social Security. But I must say, I find it difficult to follow the logic that if there is not sufficient votes to take Social Security off budget in this constitutional amendment, that somehow voting against a balanced budget in some way protects Social Security. 
I have been a Member of this body since 1989. I have seen budgets submitted by a Republican and a Democratic President, and we will see a budget submitted to us tomorrow by this President. Each President has submitted as part of a budget proposal to us the Social Security surplus. So tomorrow, the $60 billion that represents this year's surplus will be included in the spending plan that is recommended to the Congress. 
So the notion that somehow if we fail to adopt a balanced budget amendment we are protecting Social Security, I must say, is an argument the logic of which I do not understand. We are currently using that surplus in the Social Security budget to finance the operational expenses of the Federal Government. Republican Presidents have done it; Democratic Presidents have done it. And in my view, it is a misguided notion that we protect Social Security by rejecting a balanced budget amendment that does not contain the off-budget language. 
Mr. President, this Congress has a historic opportunity to take action that will positively affect this country for generations to come. If we fail, I am afraid we will continue to push financial burdens on those who come after us. Let this Congress' legacy be that it took bold action and that it did so in a bipartisan way, and that by so doing, we protect the future economic well-being of all Americans. I urge my colleagues to enact Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
As I said at the outset, I do not take amending our Constitution lightly, but I feel, in light of the circumstances of our recent history, it is the only responsible course of action. History has shown us that good intentions, Federal statutory enactments have failed to do the job. A balanced budget amendment will bring about the fiscal discipline our country so desperately needs, and I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to join with us in enacting a constitutional amendment that will balance the Federal budget in the year 2002, and, by so doing, ensure that our children and our grandchildren will enjoy the economic opportunities that have been the privilege of our generation to enjoy. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, last month U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Chairman, Ann Brown, came to Nevada to deliver her vital safety messages to my constituents in Las Vegas and Reno. Her timely visit, just before the holidays, when many people are preparing their homes for visits by friends and relatives, reminded the citizens of my State of the practical things they can do to keep their homes safe. 
In Las Vegas, we visited the home of Ms. Lori Black. Lori and her husband Mike are the parents of eight children. As we toured their home with Lori and her youngest daughter Leslie Mika and oldest daughter Ann, Chairman Brown reviewed the CPSC's baby safety checklist and found that they had done an excellent job of making their home safe for children. 
In Reno, we visited the home of Lisa and Scott Anderson and their daughter Lyndsey Sue. There, Chairman Brown was able to point out that their baby crib passed the soda can test. She demonstrated that a soda can is useful to measure the spaces between the slats in a baby's crib. If the soda can cannot go through the slats, then the crib is baby safe. 
Chairman Brown also demonstrated the importance of clipping the loop at the end of venetian blind cords. She told us in the past 14 years, 173 children had strangled in the loops of curtain and blind cords, but that as a result of a voluntary agreement she secured from the blind cord industry, manufacturers are now installing safety tassels at the end of their cords. She commended the Andersons for making their home safe for a baby by putting all medicines on an upper shelf far from a baby's curious hands and having no baby clothes with strings or cords. 
In both Las Vegas and Reno, the homes contained smoke alarms, but lacked carbon monoxide detectors. Chairman Brown emphasized to both families the necessity of these devices. Every year, about 200 people die from carbon monoxide poisoning, and thousands are treated in hospital emergency rooms. With the installation of CO detectors and annual appliance inspections, these deaths and injuries can be prevented. 
I want to commend Chairman Brown for her valuable work promoting consumer product safety in Nevada and across the country. The baby safety program she initiated is a model of the way business and government can work together as partners to advance the public interest. 
The Gerber Products Co. underwrote the costs of printing the materials for the baby safety program. This has allowed the CPSC to make the baby safety checklist and other helpful materials available to thousands of people throughout the country. 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission is a small agency with a big mission--to keep families safe in their homes and at play. It is also one of the taxpaying public's best bargains in government. CPSC's $42.5 million budget, about 16 cents per capita, helps to attack the $200 billion in annual societal costs and about $30 billion in direct medical costs. Thus, every dollar appropriated to CPSC has the potential to address about $5,000 in societal costs and about $600 in direct medical costs. As one example, the CPSC's work in making sure baby cribs are safe and removing unsafe cribs from the market has reduced crib-related deaths from 200 annually to less than 50 deaths per year. That one project alone saves society nearly $1 billion a year--or almost 25 times the CPSC's current annual budget. 
But the CPSC is most concerned with saving lives and reducing injuries and it is working even now on actions to reduce those crib-related deaths to an even lower figure. 
I would like to thank Chairman Brown for bringing her lifesaving message to the citizens of Nevada and to commend her for her excellent leadership of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I urge my colleagues to share the CPSC's baby safety checklist with the new parents and grandparents in their States.

Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today because of strong concerns I have related to the Air Force's evaluation of the events surrounding the tragic Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. The Air Force has not yet released its official report on these events, but it has been widely reported that the Air Force will recommend no disciplinary action against any officer in relation to this incident. Mr. President, I do not understand this recommendation. 
As you will recall, shortly before 10 p.m. on the evening of Tuesday, June 25, 1996, a fuel truck pulled up to the perimeter of a Khobar Towers' complex in Dharan, Saudi Arabia. This complex housed almost 3,000 airmen of the 4404th Wing, as well as military personnel from the United Kingdom, France, and Saudi Arabia. Air Force guards spotted the truck and immediately began an effort to evacuate the building. Unfortunately, before they could succeed, a large explosion occurred that destroyed the face of Building 131, killing 19 American servicemembers and seriously injuring hundreds more. 
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion the members of our Armed Forces acted heroically, restoring order and providing aid to those who had been injured. In less than 3 days the 4404th Air Wing had recovered and was once again flying its mission over the skies of southern Iraq. 
This bombing and a Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, bombing in November 1995 that killed five Americans, raised a number of fundamental questions regarding the threat of terrorism to United States forces deployed overseas and the priority of force security among those military commanders charged with responsibility for providing that security. Secretary of Defense Perry took an important step in addressing these questions by establishing an independent task force to examine the facts and circumstances surrounding the bombing. This task force was led by Gen. Wayne A. Downing, a highly respected and distinguished retired four-star general. 
The findings of the Downing report were significant and wide ranging. They covered force security standards and policies, intelligence, threat assessments, and United States-Saudi cooperation. Secretary Perry took these findings seriously and as a result has announced major changes in our approach to force protection. Unfortunately, in a number of areas it appears the Air Force has chosen to disregard the Downing task force findings. 
The contrast between the Downing report and the Air Force's apparent findings, and I use the term `apparent findings' because at this point, Mr. President, the official report has not yet been released, finding 19 of the Downing report states `The chain of command did not provide adequate guidance and support to the Commander, 4404th Wing.' Finding 20 states `The Commander, 4404th Wing did not adequately protect his forces from terrorist attack.' Did not adequately protect his forces from terrorist attack. Yet the Air Force has apparently concluded that every person in the chain of command met standards of performance and acted with due care and reasonably. Furthermore, the Downing report details the information available on the terrorist threat against our forces in the 
Khobar Towers. The Downing report states that the Khobar Towers had been described as a soft target, critical target and a specific site of concern. In addition, the Downing report notes that there was a series of 10 suspicious incidents in the preceding 90 days surrounding this complex that indicated the possibility of a terrorist threat. In contrast, the Air Force has reportedly found that the chain of command considered the threats, in view of the information known at the time, and acted with due care and prudently. This judgment by the Air Force, in my opinion, is inexplicable. 
Mr. President, the wing commander of the 4404th Wing, General Schwalier, has been scheduled for a promotion from brigadier general to two-star rank of major general. Now, I understand that hindsight is 20/20, yet I cannot ignore the findings of the Downing task force. For this reason, I have written a letter to the Secretary of the Air Force expressing strong concerns regarding this appointment. The Downing task force makes clear that General Schwalier did have command responsibility and authority for force protection of his personnel in the 4404th Wing while he could not have been expected to know the precise nature of the terrorist attack, the Downing report does raise a number of concerns regarding the priority of force protection under General Schwalier. 
For example, in light of the terrorist threat, a number of additional measures could have substantially reduced the threat from a terrorist attack. The windows facing out from the complex, Building 131, could have been coated with a shatterproof substance known as Mylar. Airmen with outside rooms could have been moved into the interior of the complex. That was the area that was most exposed, Mr. President. Finally, a higher priority could have been placed at moving the perimeter fence farther away from housing quarters. When difficulties with the Saudi Government halted plans to move the fence, the matter should have been taken up and reported up the chain of command. 
According to the Downing report, these steps were not taken. General Schwalier concentrated solely on the threat of a penetrating bomb attack and failed to address other kinds of terrorist attack. He failed to correct vulnerabilities he could have corrected, and for those vulnerabilities he could not correct by himself General Schwalier failed to raise the issues up the chain of command or coordinate with the host nation. 
Mr. President, I do not believe that the Downing report was unreasonable or looking for scapegoats. 
This task force took an independent, forthright, and tough look at the threat of terrorism and how we can respond to that threat in the future. I have no doubt this tough assessment will save U.S. lives in the future. In the same way, the Air Force must also take a tough look at its responsibilities to protect its forces from this new threat. And in this instance, Mr. President, I am afraid the Air Force has failed to do so. I urge the Secretary of the Air Force to reconsider the Air Force's conclusions regarding this horrible and tragic incident. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
