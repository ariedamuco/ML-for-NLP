Mr. DAMATO. I commend the Senator from Utah for his interest in this issue and thank him for refraining from offering this amendment. The Senator is quite correct when he states that his amendment would be unnecessary. The Banking Committee was very careful and direct in its instructions to the NCUA in Section 103 of the legislation, where the NCUA is instructed to define a `well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.' 
Additionally, in the Committee's report, language was inserted to make this point especially clear. The Committee intends for the NCUA to limit federally-chartered community credit unions to be subject to well-defined, local, geographic expansion limits.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my colleagues' attention an ominous and entirely predictable development--Slobodan Milosevic is closing the independent media in Serbia. He is following the time-worn practice of dictators by trying to control Serbians' thinking--and therefore their politics--by controlling their access to information. 
The Senate and House have declared that we have reason to believe that Milosevic has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. While offenses like denying freedom of speech, assembly, and the press to his people don't rise to that capital criminal level, they further demonstrate his fine disdain for the rules and values of the rest of the world, and his iron determination to hold power at all costs. 
We are treated to the spectacle of Milosevic's killers conducting ethnic cleansing in Kosovo while he and his political allies use the Kosovo conflict as a tool to divide and suppress Serbian domestic political opposition. The mass public demonstrations aimed at the creation of democracy in Serbia have ceased. Factions joined together in opposition to Milosevic have been split apart, as he has appealed once again to extreme nationalist Serbian sentiment. 
Indeed, his excuse for closing these independent media outlets has been because they have been spreading `fear, panic and defeatism' and undermining `the people's readiness to safeguard the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia.' He has been so happy with the results of this effort that his tame parliament, according to a report in the October 21, 1998 edition of the Washington Post, `adopted a new information law today that critics say further restricts independent media and leads the country back toward dictatorship. The law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language programs by foreign media and calls for huge fines against media editors and owners who disobey the decree. It also gives broad powers to the authorities and places further restrictions on working permits for media organizations.' 
This situation was thoroughly discussed in a Washington Post op-ed entitled `Darkness Over Serbia,' by Slobodan Pavlovic, printed in the Tuesday, October 20, 1998 edition on page A19. I commend this article to my colleagues. 
Milosevic has carefully calibrated his defiance of the rest of the world. He knows, or at least thinks he knows, what it would take to trigger a forceful response to his actions, and he stays just short of that threshold. The terrible consequences of his determination, and the world's forbearance, are clear to see in the faces of the refugees in Kosovo and hear in the silence left by the suppressed voices of his domestic opposition in Serbia. 
Just as in Bosnia, the international community, represented by Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, has gone to Milosevic in Belgrade, looking for peace in Kosovo. Once again, we have made Milosevic the indispensable man, and thereby encouraged him to remain difficult, at a level that requires our constant attention. In addition, in the process of seeking Milosevic's agreement to abide by the terms of a United Nations Security Council resolution, our visiting delegations have not met with the democratic opposition in Serbia. This has sent a regrettable message, one that we should not have sent. 
Mr. President, while we cannot save the independent media in Serbia from Milosevic's wrath, we must let them know that we care, that we have not forgotten them, that we support them, and that we understand that a democratic Serbia open to the West and the world is the solution to lasting peace in the Balkans. I also want to express my support for our efforts to sustain Serbian-language broadcasting into Serbia, which is even more important now that independent domestic voices are stifled by force. 
The people of Serbia are not enemies of the United States. The Milosevic regime is not just an enemy of the United States, it is an enemy of the world. The sooner those powers that extend, in some form, comfort and support to Milosevic realize this, the sooner we can move toward the establishment of peace in the Balkans. 
It is in no power's interest that there should be lasting war, political instability, and economic depression in the Balkans. Whatever advantage may be gained in the short term by diverting time, money, forces, and energy to coping with the results of Milosevic's unbridled political ambition can vanish quickly. If he should miscalculate or if any number of unpredictable events should take place, this conflict could spill across international borders with incalculable consequences. 
In conclusion, while expressions of our outrage cannot reopen newspapers or turn on radio or television transmitters, we can give hope and courage to those who believe in basic human rights. Freedom of speech, assembly, and the press are essential to the creation and function of civil society. Serbia and Montenegro have promised in the Helsinki Accords and elsewhere to respect and protect these rights, and Milosevic's regime is in clear and blatant violation of these commitments. I expect the United States and our allies to make clear to Milosevic that we know what he has done and is doing and will hold him responsible for these actions.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President I rise today to applaud this body for passing perhaps one of the most critical pieces of legislation this Congress. Today, before the Senate, in the omnibus appropriations bill, is the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, or more appropriately, Janet's Law. 
Mr. President, I first began the fight to pass this critical legislation on January 30, 1997 when I introduced this legislation along with Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator Olympia Snowe, Senators Hollings, Moynihan, Domenici, Faircloth, Moseley-Braun, Biden, Inouye, Murkowski, Dodd, Kerrey, Hatch, Gregg, Smith, and Ford. 
We faced an uphill fight, but we were persistent. We never gave up. 
We couldn't--Mr. President, there was too much at stake. We took on this fight for the women of America--our mothers and daughters, sisters and wives, grandmothers and friends. We took on this fight because it was critical to the health of every woman in America. 
Today, there are 2.6 million women living with breast cancer. In 1998 alone, more than 184,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and, tragically, 44,000 women will die of this dreaded disease. Breast cancer is still the most common form of cancer in women; every 3 minutes another woman is diagnosed and every 11 minutes another woman dies of breast cancer. 
I want to tell you, Mr. President, about one of those women, because the battle against breast cancer is not about statistics--it's about real women who are in the fight of their lives. Janet Franquet, a young woman, just 31 years old, from my home state of New York was recently denied reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy. 
Janet Franquet was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of breast cancer on December 11, 1997. Mrs. Franquet required a mastectomy and a very intricate, involved reconstruction of the breast following her mastectomy. The wound site required her surgeon to perform a very extensive procedure, medically necessary due to the considerable wound site after the removal of her breast. 
Mrs. Franquet's insurance provider, the National Organization of Industrial Trade Unions (NOITU) Insurance Trust Fund refused to cover the reconstruction of Mrs. Franquet's breast. Imagine the shock and horror of being told by your HMO that surgery following the removal of your breast is cosmetic. That is outrageous. 
In fact, when the surgeon performing the reconstruction asked about coverage, the Medical Director of the insurance company told Mrs. Franquet's doctor that breast reconstruction was considered cosmetic surgery, and he would have to deny coverage. 
So, Mr. President, I decided that I would give Mrs. Franquet's insurance company a call. When I spoke with the Medical Director for the insurance company, he told me that `replacement of a breast is not medically necessary and not covered under the plan. This is not a bodily function and therefore can not and should not be replaced.' 
Mrs. Franquet and her family, were left to pay for the procedure out of their own pocket. The procedure cost approximately $16,500. Luckily, her doctor, Dr. Todd Wider, agreed to forgo payment for this life saving surgery. But recently, the insurance fund agreed to pay for the surgery--only after a lengthy appeal before the Board of Directors with lawyers and doctors testifying as to the medical necessity of the surgery. 
I ask you, Mr. President, how many other Janet Franquets are out there? Will they be lucky enough to have a Dr. Wider to take care of them, or will they be forced to forgo this lifesaving surgery so that insurance companies can cut costs and save money? 
That is why, Mr. President, I began this fight in the Senate and made it my crusade every day, at every opportunity. The D'Amato legislation which we will enact into law today makes critically important changes in how breast cancer patients receive medical care. 
This important reform legislation will significantly change the way insurance companies provide coverage for women diagnosed with breast cancer. This new law will ensure that breast cancer patients will have access to reconstructive surgery following mastectomies. Too many women have been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure cosmetic and not medically necessary. It is absolutely unacceptable and wrong that many insurers have decided that this essential surgery is `cosmetic.' 
I know that there are going to be those who say let the marketplace work, let free competition work. Well, that is simply naive. To say that by insisting on a minimum standard, insisting on basic commonsense minimums we are interfering with the free market system is preposterous. For the government to not live up to its most basic duty of protecting its citizenry, that is what is wrong. 
There exists a very basic relationship between a doctor and a patient that no Member of Congress and no insurance bean counter can ever understand. That bond is so basic and so sacred that it is only the physician who is treating their patient who can truly understand it. It is only that physician who can truly determine the best course of action for their patient and knows how to save their life. Congress has a duty to protect that bond and ensure that the physician is able to practice medicine. 
This legislation is crucial not only for the women of New York, where breast cancer ranks among the top in the Nation, but for the entire country as well. Our families have been ravaged by this horrible disease. Our grandmothers, mothers and daughters, sisters and wives, children and friends have been afflicted at rates that are unexplained and far too high. 
We must continue to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to find a cure for breast cancer. But until a cure is found, we must ensure that women receive the treatment they deserve. This legislation protects women and the families and friends of women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be recognized as Janet's Law, after Janet Franquet, the woman who was the inspiration for this bill and who in fact serves as a heroine to many women who were denied reconstructive surgery prior to her. Thanks largely to Mrs. Franquet's efforts and determination in this issue, no woman will ever be denied reconstructive surgery again. Janet's case has served as an inspiration for me to keep fighting in the war against breast cancer and should be an inspiration to every Member of Congress. 
I thank all my colleagues for helping me pass this critical legislation, and I thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, chairman Stevens and the majority leader, Senator Lott for their hard work in ensuring the protection of American women who have been afflicted with breast cancer.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased that this Omnibus Appropriations Bill will include a delay of the implementation of Section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. 
The 1996 immigration law mandated the implementation of an exit-entry system at all U.S. borders by September 30, 1998. If implemented, the impact of this provision would be devastating, causing insufferable delays at the U.S.-Canadian border, particularly in my own state of New York. Trade, tourism and international relations would all suffer. 
Last year, I joined with Senator Spencer Abraham and other colleagues to introduce the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997 (S. 1360) which would maintain current cross-border traffic along the northern border and I testified at a Senate Subcommittee hearing on the repercussions of implementing Section 110 on New York. On April 23, 1998, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered and marked up the bill. The bill approved by the Committee allows land border and seaports to be exempt from the new system. The full Senate passed S. 1360 in July 1998 and also voted in support of a full repeal of Section 110. 
However, as the date of implementation grew closer, Congress enacted a two and a half year delay, which is included in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 1999. While we have some `breathing room', rest assured that I will continue to press for a full repeal of Section 110. I thank my colleagues for working with Senator Abraham and I on this important provision.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I strongly supported Senate passage of the conference report on S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. This bill extends the efforts which we undertook in 1995 to curb abusive securities class action litigation when we passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). 
This bill makes the standard we adopted in the Reform Act the national standard for securities fraud lawsuits. In particular, the Reform Act adopted a heightened pleading requirement. That heightened uniform pleading standard is the standard applied by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. At the time we adopted the Reform Act, the Second Circuit pleading standard was the highest standard in the country. Neither the Managers of Reform Act nor the Managers of this bill (and I was a Manager of both) intended to raise the pleading standard above the Second Circuit standard, as some have suggested. The Statement of Managers for this bill makes this clear when it states: `It was the intent of Congress, as was expressly stated during the legislative debate on the PSLRA, and particularly during the debate on overriding the President's veto, that the PSLRA establish a heightened uniform federal standard based upon the pleading standard applied by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.' This language is substantially identical to language contained in the Report on S. 1260 by the Senate Banking Committee, which I chair. 
The references in the Statement of Managers to the `legislative debate on the PSLRA, and particularly . . . the debate on overriding the President's veto,' are statements clarifying Congress's intent to adopt the Second Circuit pleading standard. The President vetoed the Reform Act because he feared that the Reform Act adopted a pleading standard higher than the Second Circuit's. We overrode that veto because, as the post-veto legislative debate makes clear, the President was wrong. The Reform Act did not adopt a standard higher than the Second Circuit standard; it adopted the Second Circuit standard. And that is the standard that we have adopted for this bill as well. 
The Statement of Managers also makes explicit that nothing in the Reform Act or this bill alters the liability standards in securities fraud lawsuits. Prior to adoption of the Reform Act, every Federal court of appeals in the Nation to have considered the issue--ten in number--concluded that the scienter requirement could be met by proof of recklessness. It is clear then that under the national standard we create by this bill, investors can continue to recover for losses created by reckless misconduct.

Mr. DAMATO. Today, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R.1756, the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1997. I am glad that we have been able to reach this point. The House has sent over H.R.1756, a strong antimoney laundering tool for law enforcement, and after some negotiation, we have amended the language slightly. The House has agreed to accept the compromise and I have a letter from James E. Johnson, Under Secretary for Enforcement at the Treasury Department supporting the goals of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. DAMATO. I believe we are now ready to proceed to passage of the bill providing sufficient time for the House to act. 
Mr. President, this is an important tool for the counternarcotics effort. Drug traffickers and dealers are destroying our families, communities and the future of our children, and we must fight them with 
Every weapon at our disposal. This bill will attack drug traffickers by making it harder for these criminals to profit from their illegal windfalls. 
Mr. President, through money laundering, drug traffickers are able to take their blood money and launder it clean. Their ill gotten gains are then filtered throughout our economy. Money laundering sustains drug traffickers and arms dealers, as well as terrorists and other criminals searching for a way to prolong their illegal enterprises. 
That is why I joined with Senator Grassley and Congresswoman Velazquez to develop the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act which the House passed on October 5, 1998. The bill will provide the means for federal, state and local crime fighters to pursue and prosecute the drug traffickers and those that finance their criminal trade. 
This bill will allow the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General to create a national money laundering strategy and designate high risk zones. State and local officials within these zones will be encouraged to form a task force and become eligible for enforcement and technical assistance and, most importantly, anti-money laundering grants. 
Mr. President, let me explain why this is especially important for New York, where money launderers have benefited from the financial, trade and transportation systems in the metropolitan area. New York is the largest financial center in this country--and one of the top three international money centers in the world. Unfortunately, money launderers have used this infrastructure to pursue their own criminal activities. 
Assistance by state and local officers in New York has been invaluable in stopping drug traffickers from sending money back to the cartels. In 1997, in the New York area, law enforcement officials determined that organized narcotics traffickers were using the services of unscrupulous money remitters and their agents to send the proceeds of drug sales back to the drug source countries. 
Utilizing a temporary Geographical Targeting Order (GTO) for the New York metropolitan area, remitters and agents were required to report detailed information about the remittances of cash to Colombia of more than $750. 
Within a week of the GTO's issuance, the local, state and federal agencies that made up the El Dorado Task Force found that money laundering activity in that area, Jackson Heights, dropped dramatically. The number of remittances to Colombia dropped 95 percent and the dollar amount dropped 97 percent (from $67 million to $2 million). The New York GTO resulted in the seizure of millions in currency that was diverted to bulk shipments through the air and seaports and most importantly, disrupted the profit back to the drug cartels. 
Mr. President, this operation was a huge success--thanks to the cooperative efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement. We should build on that cooperation with this legislation. 
Law enforcement efforts must follow the financial schemes and cash flows of the drug traffickers. As the drug cartels change their method of laundering their proceeds, law enforcement must respond. This bill provides law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and flexibility to do just that. This monumental effort will cripple the drug traffickers where it hurts--in their pockets--and take an important step forward in our war on drugs. 
I am proud to have cosponsored the Senate measure with Senator Grassley and to have worked with Representative Velazquez to enact this important tool in antidrug efforts. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important anticrime bill.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I understand that my good friend and colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has recently introduced legislation which would amend the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 to assure that the United States is consistent with other G-7 countries in evaluating environmental concerns whenever the Bank undertakes project financing. I understand the Senator's concerns. However, I feel that this issue would be much better addressed with a full hearing. Adding this provision onto the Omnibus Appropriations bill without fully discussing it and analyzing its implications with a hearing, may not be prudent.

Mr. DAMATO. Clearly, my friend has raised a valid concern. Certainly, no member in the Senate is in favor of needlessly denying the necessary financing to a U.S. company, and allowing them to compete internationally, especially in light of the disproportionate levels of financing, and in some cases subsidization provided by many foreign governments to their domestic businesses. I share the Senator's concerns that the Bank not give any other country an unfair advantage when it comes to competing for jobs abroad. However, I am also concerned that this issue has not been addressed properly by the Senate Banking Committee, the committee of jurisdiction with regard to this issue. When ever the Bank considers financing projects abroad, there certainly should be consideration given to the effects on the environment. And additionally, the U.S. should continue to participate in negotiations with the rest of the international community which seek to establish some set of standards for all countries.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill for myself and for Senator Moynihan that will provide compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) to Tommy Sansone, Jr. Tommy was injured by a DPT vaccine in June 1994 and continues to suffer seizures and brain damage to this day. Tommy is the unintended and helpless victim of a drug designed to help him. He needs our help because while the Vaccine Injury Program is meant to make reparations for these injuries, it is hampered by regulations that challenges the worthiest of claims. 
Let me be clear, I am not advocating against our national immunization program. Vaccines are an integral part of our preventive health program, and in no way should we stop vaccinating our kids. However, in rare instances, a child will receive a shot designed to keep him safe from whooping cough or measles or other illness but react violently to the serum and end up crippled or sometimes killed. The answer is not to stop inoculating our children. We must review the program to ensure we provide our children with the greatest protection possible against the tragic diseases that older generations of Americans knew all too well, and we must review the Vaccine Injury Act. 
Back in 1986, Congress passed the Vaccine Injury Act to take care of vaccine injuries because the shots that we required our children to get were not as safe as they could have been. Since the program was established, more than 1100 children have been compensated. Over the first ten years, a great percentage of those with seizures or brain damage or other symptoms were recognized to be DPT-injured, and, they were summarily compensated. But, by 1995, the Institutes of Medicine (IOM) and others concluded that because the symptoms had no unique clinical profile, they were not necessarily DPT injuries. So, HHS changed the definitions of encephalopathy (inflammation of the brain), and of vaccine injury. Those new definitions had unintended consequences. Now, the program that we set up to be expeditious and fair, uses criteria that are so strict that the fund from which these claims are paid pays fewer claims than before and the fund has ballooned to over $1.2 billion. As a result, families of children like Tommy find it nearly impossible to win a claim against the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Most importantly, the program is failing its mission. 
Today, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is seen as a Fort Knox of government funds that not even the worthiest claim can access without a high-priced lawyer to guide it through a labyrinth of bureaucratic regulations. It is no longer the `no-fault compensation program under which awards can be made to vaccine-injured persons quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity,' as we originally intended in 1986. 
To be clear, VICP is not a medical insurance policy. The program is not designed to take care of those who cannot get or receive care. VICP is a compensation program, where the government makes amends for a failure in the system that it established. Claims are paid from a trust fund established from surcharged that are paid on each shot a child receives. The fund serves as an insurance policy against vaccine injuries. But, following the regulatory changes made in 1995, the government is not recognizing even the most legitimate of claims. We are failing the very children we are trying to protect. 
Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the Senate Labor Committee and I have commissioned the GAO to study the vaccine injury program. We asked them to examine the overall operation and effectiveness of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and the National Vaccine Program. They will look at how revenues in the compensation fund are being managed and dispersed and whether vaccine injury claims are reviewed and processed in a fair and timely manner. They will look for those barriers, if any, that petitioners face in proving vaccine-related injuries. We've asked them to look into how well information about vaccine safety and injuries is collected, maintained and distributed, and to recommend changes (legislative or regulatory) to improve the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program and the National Vaccine Program. We want to fix VICP for children nationwide who needlessly suffer twice at the hands of the federal government; once with an adverse reaction to a vaccine they are required to receive and a second time when they cannot hold the federal government liable for their pain and suffering. But, there is something we can do now. We need to take care of this little guy, Tommy Sansone, Jr. 
Over the years after his DPT shot (the combined shot for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), Tommy suffers severe seizures and from brain damage that has hampered his mental development. When he wakes in the morning or from a nap, either his mother or father is at his side waiting for the inevitable. Tommy's eyes tear and his face cringes in agony as his entire body is wracked with a muscle-clenching seizure. His parents hold him helplessly until the seizure subsides, sometimes for as long as five minutes. Tommy will then look into his mother's loving eyes, and say, `No more, mommy. Make them stop.' 
At the very least, Tommy's parents know that the strain of vaccine used on Tommy is now being phased out because of the rash of adverse reactions it caused. But, this does nothing for Tommy or his parents who have been in and out of countless hospitals, and consulted with doctors and experts at the Centers for Disease Control and the Health Resources and Services Administration. Their claim for compensation was dismissed in the Federal Court of Claims, but they and Tommy's doctor feel (and I agree with them) that they should have known more about the potential dangers of the DPT vaccine that Tommy received on June 1, 1994. No one told them that there was a chance that the DPT vaccine could cause such trauma. No one told them about `hot lots,' an unofficial team for a batch of shots that has had an abundance of adverse reactions. The lot that Tommy received is known to have had 44 such reactions from March-November 1994, including 2 deaths. These are reactions beyond the short-lived fever and rashes that accompany many vaccines. Their doctor didn't know about the availability of the `new' acellular strain of pertussis vaccine that is replacing the whole cell version that has been used since the 1930s. Sure, it costs a couple of dollars more, but who wouldn't choose that for their child--given the choice? 
Tommy's claim would have been covered before the 1995 changes, but that is not the case any longer. He's the victim of a bad DPT vaccine, yet his case continues to be denied because the first seizure didn't occur within 72 hours of the shot. It occurred 18 days later, and he suffers to this day. Tommy also has brain damage (encephalopathy) because of the DPT shot, but it doesn't fit that new definition either. He cried and moaned at a shrill pitch from the moment of the shot until his first seizure, but that doesn't matter either. For the first six months of his life, tommy was in all ways normal, but for 4 and a half years since the DPT vaccine he and his family have suffered. As a parent and grandparent, I would do anything to protect my family from such pain and suffering. Tom Senior has done everything he knows how to help his son. Now he has turned to me because he knows I am in a position to help and I will not relent in my pursuit of relief for the Sansone family. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program should take care of Tommy, but it doesn't. This bill will enable us to ensure that it does.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, about a year ago, the distinguished Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, and I introduced legislation (S. 1252) to increase the amount of low-income housing tax credits allocated to each state to reflect inflation since 1986, and to index this amount to reflect future inflation. Today, we have 64 additional cosponsors. In this time when the conventional wisdom is that everything is supposed to be so partisan in Washington, it is a very good testament about the importance of the low-income housing tax credit that S. 1252 has garnered the bipartisan support of two-thirds of the Senate. 
I guess we should not be surprised about this support. The housing credit has become an extraordinarily effective mechanism to encourage construction of affordable housing. Since its creation in 1986, the low-income housing tax credit has successfully expanded the supply of affordable housing and helped revitalize economically distressed areas throughout the United States. The credit has been responsible for almost 900,000 units of housing in the past decade. Nearly all new affordable housing today (98%) is constructed with the help of the credit. Without the credit, these units simply would not be available. 
Credits are allocated to each of the states on a formula based on population: $1.25 multiplied by the number of people in the state. Each state must adopt an allocation plan based on housing needs in that particular state. Then private developers compete for allocation of the limited amount of tax credit. This creates an environment where each state can encourage the type and location of affordable housing it needs. And the competition for limited amounts of credit means that the Federal Government gets more and better housing for each credit dollar. Effectively, the low income housing tax credit is a block grant to each state, and each state uses market competition to maximize the amount and quality of the housing. 
In March, 1997, after an 18 month study of the program, the General Accounting Office reported on the many achievements of the program without finding any problems in need of legislative correction. In fact, the GAO study concluded that families living in housing built with the help of the credit had incomes that were lower than that required by statute. 
Unfortunately, the amount of credit that can be allocated each year has not been adjusted since the program was created in 1986. If the credit had been indexed for inflation since it was first enacted, the per capita credit amount would be $1.85 this year. 
Although building costs rise each year, as does the affordable housing needs of the nation, the federal government's most important and successful housing program is in effect being cut annually as a result of inflation. When the cap was first established, the credit would fund 115,000 units. Now it will fund between 75,000 and 80,000 units. Despite economic prosperity in recent years, the shortage in affordable housing has become more, not less, severe. According to HUD, the number of households with crisis-level rental housing needs exceeds 5 million. 
I had hoped that we would have been able to see the enactment of S. 1252 this year. Twelve years of erosion in value of the credit should be enough. Unfortunately, it appears that this meritorious legislation will have to wait until next year. It is not often that we can find a proposal that is supported by a bipartisan two-thirds of the Senate, a majority of Republican governors, and a Democratic President. Given the need for additional affordable housing, the effectiveness of the credit, and its broad bipartisan support among elected officials at all levels of government, I am very hopeful that we will be able to make this legislation a priority tax item early next year when the new Congress convenes.

Mr. DAMATO. Yes, my colleague from Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee is correct. Due to a clerical error, the joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference on S. 1260, was printed without the final page. This page contained some essential explanatory information regarding the 1995 Securities Litigation Reform Act regarding scienter standards. Unfortunately, this same clerical error occurred in the version of the report language that appeared in the House Record at H10270. The official version of the joint explanatory statement was filed in the Senate on October 9th and did contain the page that was omitted by the GPO and the Congressional Record for October 9th. 
In order to clarify this situation, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the explanatory statement be reprinted in its entirety.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the broadbased support that this bill enjoys is a tribute to Senators Domenici, Gramm, and Dodd, the chief cosponsors of its legislation. This bill provides a case study on how to get legislation done. They focused on solving a specific serious problem, and built a wide base of support for the bill. The problem to which I referred is a loophole that strike lawyers have found in the 1995 private securities litigation reform bill. 
Mr. President, the 1995 act was enacted in the last Congress in response to a wave of harassment litigation that threatened the efficiency and integrity of our national stock markets, as well as the value of stock portfolios of individual investors. This threat was particularly debilitating to so-called high-tech companies who desperately need access to our capital markets for research, development and production of cutting-edge technology. These companies not only help to create jobs and drive our economic growth, they create substantial wealth for their shareholders. As one witness before the Securities Subcommittee testified: 
The continuing specter of frivolous strike suits poses still another threat to investors: the inordinate costs these suits impose on corporations--and ultimately on their shareholders. 
Mr. President, that is a statement that bears repeating: that ultimately the cost of strike suits are borne by shareholders, including ordinary people saving for their children's education or retirement. It is these people, the ordinary investor, who foot the bill for high-price settlements of harassment litigation. 
Now, let me make one thing clear--we are not talking about preventing legitimate litigation. Real plaintiffs with legitimate claims deserve their day in court. But we should not condone little more than a judicially sanctioned shakedown that only benefits strike lawyers. Companies that engage in fraudulent conduct should be held fully liable for their actions; however, companies should not be forced to settle cases that have no merit just to minimize their loses. 
Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to our colleagues in the House, particularly Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley and Subcommittee Chairman Oxley, for their continued cooperation and good will in a truly bicameral partnership to protect investors.

Mr. DAMATO. I am sympathetic to the SEC's concerns. In acting now to establish uniform national standards, it is important that we make clear our understanding of the standards created by the '95 Reform Act because those are the standards that will apply if S. 1260 is enacted into law. My clear intent in 1995, and my understanding today, is that the PSLRA did not in any way alter the scienter standard in federal securities fraud lawsuits. The '95 Reform Act requires plaintiffs, and I quote, `to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.' The '95 Reform Act makes no attempt to alter or define that state of mind. In addition, it was my intent in 1995, and it is my understanding today, that the 1995 Reform Act adopted the pleading standard applied in the second circuit.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the young men and women that served bravely in the United States military during WWI, and to one veteran in particular, Alexander C. Schlehr. Mr. Schlehr, of Buffalo, NY, is one of only 1,800 living veterans of this war. He courageously lived through the perils of European trench warfare and served his country honorably. 
Due to his strong desire to assist his country in the war effort, Alexander enlisted in the army at the young age of 19. Immediately, he was incorporated into 59th Pioneer Infantry, later to be known as the Corps of Engineers. Even before Alex's infantry landed in France, the boat on which he was traveling was attacked by enemy torpedoes. Thus, he has experienced all aspects of warfare, both on the sea and in the trenches of France and in the Argonne forest. For his patriotic and heroic service, Schlehr has been awarded a WWI medal with three Battle Stars and is currently being reviewed for the French `Legion of Honor' medal. He is also considered a local hero. His service has been exalted in his local newspaper, the Amherst Bee, and has been recognized by local and top government officials, all of whom contacted him on his 100th birthday. 
Yet, Alexander Schlehr's desire to serve his country did not end at the close of the war. When the war ended, Schlehr graciously helped in handling the personal belongings of discharged officers. He has raised four children, one of which has served the United States in wartime as well, and prospered as a successful business man. Furthermore, he has received numerous awards and recognitions denoting his sixty years of service in the American Legion and the Commandeers. 
I feel it is my duty to recognize the outstanding service Alexander Schlehr has given to this country during his 101 years of life. He is an example for all Americans through his selfless and courageous actions. I thank him for his dedication to our country and wish him a Happy 102nd Birthday this coming spring.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S.Con.Res. 122, introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator Levin, commemorating the 65th anniversary of the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33. It is timely once again for us to join together to call the world's attention to this cold act of mass murder, to remember its victims, and to pledge ourselves to prevent hunger from being used as a weapon of genocide. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution. 
The Ukrainian Famine ranks among the most devastating human tragedies of all time, with an estimated loss of life exceeding 7 million men, women and children. Millions of Ukrainians died not from natural causes, but from policies designed to eradicate Ukraine's cultural and political identity and to punish the Ukrainian people for resisting the forced collectivization of agriculture. As such, the Famine is a dramatic testament to the brutality of the imperial Soviet system, responsible for the destruction of tens of millions of lives over the course of its 70-year existence. 
The Ukrainian Famine was a crime of epic proportions. In the 1980's the U.S. Commission on the Ukraine Famine painstakingly documented every aspect of this genocide, collecting an impressive body of material documenting the tragedy inflicted upon Ukrainians by their Soviet masters. Members of the Famine Commission from this body and from the House of Representatives held hearings around the country in which elderly eyewitnesses recounted the consequences of Stalin's genocidal policies in starkly human terms, giving poignant and often gruesome accounts of the horrors they, their families, friends and fellow countrymen faced. The Famine Commission's final report to Congress confirmed the man-made nature of the Famine, specifically, the complicity of Joseph Stalin and those around him in its conception and execution. 
Clearly, the Ukrainian Famine occurred within the context of a Soviet system which denied and vigorously opposed democratic values, the rule of law, and any respect for elementary human rights. Now that Ukraine is free from foreign domination and is moving towards full respect for human rights, democratic values and the rule of law, the likelihood of a similar catastrophe, at the present time, appears remote. 
Nevertheless, I strongly agree with the resolution's assertion that it is essential that the United States continue to assist Ukraine as it proceeds towards democracy, a free-market economy, and full respect for human rights. It is imperative for America and for the West to support independence and democracy in Ukraine to ensure that Ukraine never again experiences domination by a foreign power hostile to Ukraine's very identity as a people and as a nation. 
Mr. President, in closing, I once again urge my colleagues to join together in support of this important resolution.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, 1998 marks the 20th anniversary of RID-Remove Intoxicated Drivers. Formed in 1978 by Doris Aiken in New York, the organization has focused its efforts on educating the public on the impact of abusive alcohol use, offering support for the victims of drunk drivers and advocating for stricter laws on DWI. 
RID has lobbied for the enactment of laws that will eliminate plea bargains for repeat offenders and funds for anti-DWI enforcement. With all their hard work, RID is able to claim credit for high safety ratings experienced in New York State. RID has also advocated for the lowering of the blood alcohol content from .1% to .08% as well as enhanced penalties for drunk drivers whose passengers are minors. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety recognized the accomplishments of RID and awarded them the 1998 Public Service Award for their effective campaign to deter drunk driving. Their efforts contributed to New York being selected as having one of the safest records against drunk driving in the Nation for the fifth year. 
In 1996, over 17,000 people died in drunk driving accidents, accounting for 41% of the total traffic fatalities of that year. While there was a 29% reduction from the alcohol related fatalities in 1986, it is still high--17,126 people too high. The senseless death of these individuals, the pain and anguish experienced by the family and friends and the hundreds of thousands who were injured can never truly be expressed through statistics. RID's accomplishments are for these victims and for potential victims of alcohol-related accidents. 
I would like to add my congratulations to the many that RID has already received--on being recognized for their achievements in curbing drunk driving and on their 20 years of public service.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act, I rise today to commend my colleagues for their efforts to bring this bill to the Senate. This legislation takes concrete steps to insure continued U.S. leadership and diplomatic focus on issues of religious liberty around the world. Few things are more precious to the American people than freedom of religion, and I strongly support our efforts to bring this freedom to those who are persecuted for their faiths around the world. 
The vast majority of those who suffer abridgement of their right to religious liberty do not suffer torture, rape, or murder. Instead, they face harassment, discrimination, and onerous bureaucratic obstacles to registering their religious organizations. The Act covers all violations of religious liberty, not just the most egregious acts of persecution and I commend the drafters of this legislation for its broad coverage. 
As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I am very concerned over rising religious intolerance and even oppression in the OSCE region. As Eastern European countries begin to loosen their grip on their economies, they must also learn to relinquish government control over legitimate private action by their citizenry that is protected by international commitments. I have written repeatedly strong letters to heads of state or government in support of religious liberty and to hold them to their international human rights commitments. 
The Commission has had two hearings and several public briefings on this issue in the OSCE region. We have heard testimony that, contrary to our expectations when the Communist governments of the former Warsaw Pact states fell, a variety of official measures have been taken restricting, or in some cases denying, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief. One of the core values of the United States is freedom of religion. The various documents of the Helsinki Process and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights have adopted this fundamental freedom and established it as an international norm all nations are expected to meet. I strongly believe that adoption of this legislation will help the United States advocate religious liberty around the world, and address some of the specific problems our hearings and briefings have documented. 
This year in Uzbekistan, for instance, a new law was passed which, among other restrictions, requires 100 Uzbek citizens to sign a religious community's application for registration, criminalizes any unregistered religious activity, and penalizes religious free speech. In 1997, similarly restrictive laws were passed in Russia and Macedonia and a number of OSCE participating states are reportedly considering legislation imposing significant restrictions on religious liberty, particularly for minority religious groups. 
In Western Europe, the trends toward increased religious intolerance has been more insidious. In the last few years, governments in Western Europe, particularly France, Germany, Belgium, and Austria, have targeted numerous groups that they label `dangerous' and have published official government propaganda against them, placed them under surveillance by security agencies, and revoked tax exempt status based on the determination that groups are not a positive influence on society. Furthermore, these Western European actions embolden the more intolerant sectors of Eastern European society to further restrict religious liberty for minority or ill-favored groups. 
By requiring the President to take action against all countries engaged in violations of religious liberty, the Act insures that less egregious cases of religious liberty violations will not be ignored. By enumerating the specific policy responses required ranging from a private demarche to sanctions, the Act reflects the need for flexibility in diplomacy. Finally, by instituting a separate commission, the Act facilitates accurate and independent reporting on religious liberty violations around the world. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this important legislation and I urge my colleagues to support the International Religious Freedom Act. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my good friend Senator Bond in order to fully clarify a provision of the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I am pleased that the conferees have included language in Section 226 of the VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report (H. Rpt. 105-769) which would clarify that existing contractual arrangements between the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) and HUD are maintained. Under current practice, NYCHA is expressly allowed, under prior formula agreement with HUD, to utilize its existing allocations of operating and modernization subsidies for the benefit of certain state and city developed public housing units. While the FY 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations Act will not allocate any additional funds for these local units, the Act does include a specific statutory protection for units which were assisted prior to October 1, 1998. Thus, the current contractual relationship between NYCHA and HUD would be fully protected and maintained. I would ask the distinguished Chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee if my explanation is consistent with the intent of the conferees?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998. This public and assisted housing reform legislation is the result of four years of delicate crafting and compromise and has bipartisan Congressional support and the endorsement of Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Cuomo. I support its final passage today as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Independent Agencies appropriations bill (H.R.4194). 
Mr. President, it is with great respect that I salute the distinguished Chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, Senator Connie Mack. Senator Mack is owed a debt of gratitude for his great determination and commitment to an informed and reasoned approach to public housing reform. He consistently pursued a steadfast course toward a compromise which represents a positive change to the existing public housing system while protecting our residents whom the program serves. I commend him for his strong leadership and effective stewardship of this landmark legislation. 
I also commend Banking Committee Ranking Minority Member Paul Sarbanes, Housing Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member John Kerry, all Members of the Banking Committee and many interested Members of the Senate for their essential guidance and leadership on this issue. Chairman Kit Bond and Ranking Member Barbara Mikulski of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee deserve our appreciation for their willingness to allow this bipartisan legislation to be included in the Fiscal Year 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations Act. Our House colleagues, in particular Banking Subcommittee on Housing Chairman Rick Lazio, Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, Banking Committee Ranking Minority Member John LaFalce and Housing Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member Joe Kennedy, all deserve thanks and appreciation. In addition, I commend and thank HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and his Administration for his able assistance and support of this bill. All deserve credit for their dedication to this consensus-building effort. 
Resident associations, public housing authorities, low-income housing advocates, non-profit organizations, state and local officials and other affected parties have shared their views and participated in this important political and policy process. I express my thanks to all for their significant involvement which has successfully yielded a balanced, fair, and comprehensive reform bill which will enhance and revitalize affordable housing throughout our nation. 
The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act recognizes that the vast majority of public housing is well-managed and provides over 1 million American families, elderly and disabled with decent, safe and affordable housing. It also responds to the need for improvements to the public and assisted housing system. It will protect our residents by maintaining the Brooke amendment, which caps rents at 30% of a tenant's income, and establishing a ceiling rent voluntary option as an incentive for working families. In addition, the bill will ensure that housing assistance continues to be targeted to those most in need. Forty percent of all public housing units which become vacant in any year and seventy-five percent of re-issued Section 8 vouchers will be targeted to families with incomes below thirty percent of the local area median income. It will expand homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income families. The bill also will speed the demolition of distressed housing projects through the repeal of the one-for-one replacement requirement. 
The reforms contained in this Act will reduce the costs of public and assisted housing to the Federal Government by streamlining regulations, facilitating the formation of local partnerships, and leveraging additional state, local and private resources to improve the quality of the existing stock. These changes will help ensure that federal funds can be used more efficiently in order to serve additional families through the creation of mixed income communities. 
Mr. President, I would like to comment in more detail on a few of the many significant provisions in the bill. The legislation recognizes that every American deserves to live in a safe and secure community. To achieve that goal, a number of safety and security provisions have been included in the bill. Specifically, the Act will allow police officers to reside in public and assisted housing, regardless of their income. Also, the Act improves tenant screening and eviction procedures against persons engaged in violent or drug-related crimes or behavior which disrupts the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other tenants or public housing employees. In addition, the Act will serve to improve coordination between housing authorities, local law enforcement agencies and resident councils, particularly in developing and implementing anti-crime strategies. 
Further, at my request, the Act includes provision to ban child molesters and sexually violent predators from receiving federal housing assistance. To achieve this, local public housing agencies would be granted access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's national database on sexually violent offenders, as well as State databases. This improved records access provision is critical to ensuring that these offenders are properly screened out and prevented from endangering our children. 
Another critical safety and security measure will ensure that housing authorities have the well-defined power to ban absentee and negligent landlords from participation in the Section 8 voucher program. Currently, HUD's regulations only allow housing authorities to refuse to do business with absentee landlords on very narrow grounds. The legislation being passed today will clarify that housing authorities may cease to do business with landlords who refuse to take action against tenants who are engaged in criminal activity or who threaten the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of their neighbors. 
In addition, my proposals to protect the essential rights of current residents have been adopted in the Act and I commend the residents of my home State for bringing injustices to my attention so that I might act. First, the protection against eviction without good cause has been fully maintained in the Act. This is critical for the hundreds of thousands of senior, disabled and hardworking low-income New Yorkers who depend on public and assisted housing for shelter. Second, the residents' right to organize and assemble has been fully protected and extended to the project-based and Section 8 opt-out properties. It is imperative that residents have their First Amendment rights to free speech and assembly protected. Finally, the Act makes absolutely clear that no provision of the existing HUD regulation (24 CFR 964) governing resident councils is in any way abrogated by this Act. I am gratified that the Act protects the residents' right to organize and empower themselves to improve further their own communities. 
Without the tireless and steadfast efforts of our staff, this bill would not have become a reality. I would like to express my appreciation and thanks to the following Senate majority and minority Banking Committee and Housing Subcommittee staff: Chris Lord, Kari Davidson, Cheh Kim, Jonathan Miller, Matthew Josephs, and Army Randel. I would also like to commend the House Banking Committee and Housing Subcommittee staff for their fine work and spirit of cooperation. 
Mr. President, this landmark legislation will greatly improve the quality of life for our nation's families residing in public and assisted housing and will help to ensure the long-term viability of our nation's existing stock of affordable housing. I respectfully urge its immediate passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would ask my friend Senator Mack for a clarification of the provision included in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 which will grant residents a voluntary option to choose a flat rent. Several clarifying provisions have been added to the legislation to protect residents and reduce the administrative burden of such a choice on housing authorities. First, residents will be protected from being coerced into making a choice of rents which is adverse to their interest. Second, in the case of a financial hardship, residents are granted the right to an immediate change to the Brooke Amendment rent, which caps rent at no greater than thirty percent of income. 
Mr. President, the Act also specifically provides that no additional administrative burden be placed on housing authorities that already administer flat rent or ceiling rent systems. If an agency's present system allows the family the opportunity to annually request a change from an income-based system to a flat or ceiling rent system, or vice-versa, the fact that rent is initially determined by an existing computer system which automatically selects the lower rent should not be considered contrary to the requirements of the Act. I would ask Senator Mack if these statements accurately describe the provisions of the Act?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Mack his view of the provisions of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 that relate to the renewal of expiring tenant-based Section 8 contracts. I am greatly heartened by the inclusion of specific terms for the renewal of expiring Section 8 tenant-based contracts. The renewal terms included in the Act will ensure that housing authorities continue to receive full funding to maintain effective Section 8 assisted housing programs. The Act's renewal provision will address a number of problems which have arisen--including a very serious potential threat to affordable housing in my home State of New York--as a result of HUD's attempt to revise its method of funding renewals. 
Under the renewal terms of Section 556 of the Act, housing authorities will be ensured that they receive full funding to maintain their current obligations and continue to re-issue turnover vouchers, without any attrition or loss of assistance. Housing authorities in New York will be able to continue to assist thousands of new families each year--particularly the homeless and victims of domestic violence. Without the changes included in this legislation, the New York City Housing Authority alone could have suffered a loss of over 7,000 vouchers over the next few years. This potential catastrophe has been averted. 
To be more specific, Section 556 establishes a baseline for maintaining current Section 8 obligations. This baseline is to be calculated by taking into account the number of families which were actually under lease as of October 1, 1997 plus any incremental units or additional units authorized by HUD after that date. It is the explicit intent of the authors of this legislation that the units approved by HUD pursuant to its April 1, 1998 Notice shall be included in the definition of `additional families authorized.' Finally, HUD shall apply an inflation factor to the baseline which takes into account local factors such as actual increases in local market rents. 
I would ask Senator Mack, if these statements are consistent with his views of the legislation?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the respected Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, Senator Connie Mack and the full Committee Ranking Member, Senator Paul Sarbanes. One of the most significant provisions addressed by the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 is the amendment of the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990. 
Mr. President, the Drug Elimination Program is critical to the fight against drugs and serious, violent crime in our Federal housing developments. The residents of this housing have a right to a safe and peaceful environment. The Federal Government bears a unique and overriding responsibility to ensure that residents feel secure in their homes, can walk to the store or send their children to school without fear for their physical well-being. I am especially appreciative of the inclusion of a funding mechanism which will ensure the continued direction of assistance to housing authorities with significant needs. In my home State, the Drug Elimination Program plays a critical role in communities from Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany to Brooklyn, the Bronx and Long Island. The provisions of the Act will ensure that existing programs are placed on a solid financial foundation--without precluding assistance to new programs which meet urgent or serious crime problems. 
I would ask the distinguished Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee for his views on the legislation?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden, I submit a Concurrent Resolution opposing the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian State. The House version of this resolution is being introduced by Rep. Jim Saxton, my colleague from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, Yasir Arafat seeks to abandon the Oslo process and unilaterally declare a Palestinian state at the conclusion of the transition period of five years, in May 1999. He has even gone as far as calling upon world leaders to support an independent Palestinian state. This is wholly unacceptable. 
I have in the past questioned Arafat's motives and his sincerity and I do so again. This act on his part will be a clear abrogation of the Peace Process and a slap in the face to Israel which has adhered to the process, despite continual non-compliance by the Palestinians. But then, we should not be surprised. This is the same group that harbors and praises those who kill innocent men, women and children in bus bombings that kill Israelis and Americans alike. 
Five years ago, the world was provided with a glimmer of hope that the leopard had changed its spots, but that hope was never realized. Not only did the leopard not change his spots, he has grown bigger and bolder. The Palestinian Authority, which Arafat now heads, has been legitimized and now carries out its aggressive policies, not under the cover of darkness like the PLO used to do, but in broad daylight for all to see. In no way can the United States lend further credence to this terrorist force. 
The purpose of this resolution is to send the message that the United States cannot and should not extend recognition to a unilaterally declared Palestinian state. Moreover, the President should publicly and unequivocally state that the United States will actively oppose such a declaration. If Israel were to take a unilateral action in defiance of Oslo, the Palestinians would express outrage over the violations. The Palestinians view themselves as different however. Such a move by the Palestinians cannot be allowed. The final political status of the Palestinians can only be determined through bilateral negotiation and agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not by a unilateral act in defiance of the very agreement the Palestinians signed with Israel. 
Mr. President, my colleagues and I are serious. The Administration must understand that such a move by the Palestinians is an insult to all those who were patient in light of all of the Palestinian violations of the peace. Moreover, the Administration in legitimizing these acts, would be humiliating Israel which is the only true democracy in the Middle East and our close ally. The Administration's confusion on the issue in recent months has not helped matters and the extension of diplomatic recognition would severely harm the U.S. ability to act as an impartial mediator between the two parties. Simply put, U.S. recognition of a Palestinian declaration of statehood would be the acceptance and acquiescence of the Palestinians' violation of its commitments under Oslo. We would be rewarding them for their flagrant violations of the Peace Process. This would be an error of historical proportion. I can only hope we do not make this mistake. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and urge its speedy passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I know that a number of my colleagues are on the floor who want to make statements. I see Senator Domenici is here, and he indicated to me that he wanted to speak for several minutes. I am wondering if my colleagues would agree to let Senator Domenici make his statement, and then I would like to address the vote that has just taken place. I am not going to spend too much time. If there is no objection, I will yield to Senator Domenici without losing my right to simply speak to this vote.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend my colleagues for the overwhelming vote on H.R. 10, the financial services modernization bill, which passed 93 to 0, in terms of moving forward. It was a motion to proceed to consider. I know it wasn't on the bill itself, and I know that there are some Members who do not agree and some who oppose very strongly various provisions of the bill. That is understandable, because it is a major piece of legislation. 
I thank the majority and the minority leaders for their support and for their help in getting this bill to this point, facilitating it, and the members of the Banking Committee and the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes of Maryland, who have worked in the most constructive of manners, putting the interests and needs of the financial services community of this great Nation of ours--the capital formation system that is so important--putting those interests and needs first. 
I have to tell you that this is not a partisan matter, that the Senate has addressed this in the uniquely bipartisan way that reflects very, very credibly upon this institution, again, recognizing the fact that Members certainly cannot agree with all of the provisions that may be contained in this very comprehensive bill. 
Mr. President, the need for legislation to modernize the financial services industry is obvious. The existing legal framework has been for some time fundamentally outdated, and this body itself has recognized the existing laws are part of the statutory framework built largely in the 1930s and they just do not fit the realities of today's financial marketplace. 
Congress has been attempting to pass legislation to modernize this system for almost 25 years. The only barrier to success now is the Senate of the United States. We really are at a historic moment. 
Let me cite the views of Paul Volcker, a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to place our deliberations in some kind of historical perspective. No one can say it is turf as it relates to Mr. Volcker and what his position may or a may not be. He says:  
Over the long years of debate, it typically has been the U.S. Senate that has been in the vanguard in seeking reform, and it was the House that could not reach satisfactory consensus. Now, after extended hearings and debate, with strong leadership support, a coherent and responsible bill has emerged from that body. This month the Senate has a unique opportunity to complete the process, ending years of frustration for the markets and for Congress alike. At issue is not just the matter of American banking legislation and certainly not a narrow political calculation of what parochial industry position is most completely satisfied. This is a time for the United States in much easier circumstances to demonstrate that we are capable of enacting ourselves the kind of reforms we press on others. 
Mr. President, how cogent these words and these observations are. Indeed, Mr. Volcker wrote this article and submitted it, and it has been carried in a number of news media across the country some weeks before the full extent of what is taking place in the world banking community and the financial services industry has been understood, before it has become even more important and paramount that the kinds of reforms that are so necessary and that many other countries have been avoiding are reforms that we ourselves must and should undertake, instead of having a piecemeal approach in a haphazard way, of whether the regulator at the Fed or the Treasury in terms of the Comptroller undertaking changes leaves us in a situation where I can truthfully say we have abdicated our responsibility. I hope that we will not lose this opportunity to discharge our responsibilities in a manner that will reflect credibly on this body and the Congress of the United States and on each and every Member. 
Mr. President, the fact is that this bill is a good bill. The fact is that we have been able to get together, for the first time, in an unprecedented fashion, a broad consensus for the need for financial modernization by the players themselves, by the people who are actually in this area. Virtually all of the financial services community has endorsed this legislation. 
Indeed, let me just list a number of those groups. The American Community Bankers. How often have we heard it said, `Oh, the little bankers are opposed to this.' Indeed, the American Community Bankers are in favor of this legislation. The American Bankers Association. Now we are talking about the larger banks. They have signed on. So from community bankers to large money center banks. The American Council of Life Insurance Companies. Imagine, when did we ever have the life insurance industry and the Congress working together with their banking contemporaries? There has been such fierce estrangement of the issues. The Financial Services Council, the Independent Bankers Association of America, the Independent Insurance Association. Now we are talking about those people who are out there selling and who heretofore have been adamantly opposed; we have them supporting this. The Investment Companies Institute, the securities industry, the Bond Market Association, the National Association of Multiple Insurance Companies, and most executives of major financial companies have been strongly supportive. 
Mr. President, no less than former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Volcker--and I read his remarks--is totally supportive because it is long overdue. Our present Chairman, Alan Greenspan, one of the world's most respected bankers, says this is a good bill and is supportive. The Securities and Exchange Commission and their Chairman, Arthur Levitt, are supportive of this bill. 
Yes, there is room for reasonable people to have differences over various aspects of this bill. I suggest to you that some of those differences can and should be debated, the time can be provided, and that we can vote on them, and let the will of the Congress decide and not let the clock of a late session be the enemy of progress. Let's not let the quest for perfection stop that which is an excellent bill. Let's not look for 100 percent when we can get 99 and be doing the business of the people. 
I am not going to argue the merits of some of those positions that my friends have--friends on my side of the aisle. Indeed, when it comes to various issues, reasonable people can disagree, but the question is, are we going to undertake our responsibilities in a manner which befits the great office and the prestige of U.S. Senators or are we going to say, no, unless I get it my way 100 percent, dot the i, cross the t, we are going to kill that which would otherwise advance the interests of all of our people, all of our citizens? 
I hope that we can move to a higher level. I am not prepared to, nor will I, debate the relative merits of the changes that some of my colleagues are suggesting are necessary to earn their support. Indeed, I am not going to defend those who may have used the present law in a manner never intended to gain their way, to gain financial advantage for themselves as opposed to their community. If and when that takes place, it is wrong. It should be stopped. 
But I suggest that if we look at the totality of this bill, to say that, unless we can deal with this particular abuse, we are not going to have financial reform, would be a mistake. I am not going to defend those who have used the law inappropriately, those who in essence violate the spirit, yes, and I think the actual law that exists today. 
Do I think that we could do better? Yes, if we had sufficient time. Do I think we could bring together and put together a coalition that could pass this bill if, indeed, we adopted some of the changes that my colleagues and friends might want to see? And I am talking specifically about the area of CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act. The answer is no; it would be the death of the bill. 
Now, Mr. President, I could understand my colleagues'--and I do understand--strong revulsion for the manner in which CRA may have been used in particular cases that they are conversant with, familiar with, and that they have put forth to this body. I understand that. But I do have difficulty understanding how and why at this time, when we can achieve such great progress in dealing with 90-plus percent of the problems that exist today, where we can make the kinds of fundamental changes that almost everyone agrees are necessary so that we can meet our obligations here at home and in the world of finances, we would sacrifice that gain because we can't get perfection at this point in time. 
Wouldn't it be better to improve the situation dramatically by passage of this bill notwithstanding that it may not deal with an area that is as contentious as CRA? I suggest to you that if we had a great and strong bill, a platform by which we could see that our financial services could operate without having to go to the regulator, to the nameless, faceless regulator day in and day out to get various exemptions that may favor one over another, that is not in the interest of this country. 
The piecemeal legislation, day in and day out, how do we better ourselves by that? What kind of an example do we set for the rest of the world when we say we can't even agree on a fundamental operation? Because we want perfection? Because we want to cure that deficiency that is there, that some have been evil in using and may be, in quoting the words of some of my friends, using to extort? I do not condone that, but you are not going to cure it here. And what we will be doing is killing an opportunity to make substantial progress. That is what we are doing. And you have to weight that up. Are you going to achieve substantial progress? And if you can make that cure, I will be with you. But you can't. Understand it. 
Now, if the managers of the bill said under no circumstances are we going to permit you to offer amendments, we want to go right to cloture to cut off your amendments and your right to offer amendments and your right to debate them and to let people hear what is taking place, then I could understand using every parliamentary procedure to stop this bill. 
That is not the case. This Senator would be willing to say, and I know because I have discussed it with the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, we would offer any reasonable time for Members of this body to offer amendments dealing with the problems that may exist in CRA, dealing with possible solutions, and having votes, whether they are up or down, without amendments, to see if we can't get a consensus. I don't believe you can. And if you can't get your position today, at least to give the people of the United States an opportunity to have a banking bill which people understand clearly and not one that is manipulated day in and day out by the various needs and exigencies of the financial services community so that they have to come pleading: `Oh, well, will you let me sell insurance? Oh, well, will you let me do securities? Oh, well, can I do it in the bank or outside the bank? Oh, well, is this legal or is that legal?' 
While one group is receiving permission to do something, others are left behind. That is not the way for this country to be operating. It is wrong, and it is, indeed, an abrogation of our responsibility--an abrogation. 
I hope, even at this late hour, notwithstanding the deep feelings that my colleagues have, related to the abuses that have taken place, that they would say the greater picture is one of doing the most good for the most people. That is what we are talking about. 
This is an opportunity to do the most good--not for one industry over another but for our great country, and to see to it that there is a law that everyone sees clearly, where we reduce the necessity of having major financial institutions and parts of our industry being placed at competitive disadvantages because one gets a certain permission and another is left behind and then quickly must move to deal with that. That is not what competition in America can and should be about. 
I have heard my colleagues raise this argument. I have been critical, yes, of the regulators for what I thought was absolutely going beyond what Congress had ever given to them. But the courts have said, and I think they have done it on a practical basis, that if you, the Congress, do not stop them with legislation, or you do not pass legislation that sets the ground rules, why, it is obvious that is the manner in which the law should be administered. 
I do not think that is responsible. I really do not believe our forefathers ever thought or intended for us to operate in this manner, under these conditions. I certainly think that, looking at the world economic situation today, this does not create stability, if we fail to complete this. I say `fail to complete' because there are those who can run the clock out, run it out on our American citizens, because that is who is going to be deprived. Yes, all of our citizens. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the `Holocaust Assets Tax Exclusion Act of 1998.' This act will make all income received by Holocaust survivors or their heirs from any settlement or adjudication in their favor, non-taxable. This legislation is now very much needed because survivors of the Holocaust who had assets withheld from them by Swiss banks or others have finally received justice in the form of a settlement between the banks and the survivors' attorneys in August 1998. The settlement was for $1.25 billion for survivors worldwide. We must remember, one-third of all Holocaust survivors live in the United States. This is why this legislation is so needed. 
In addition to these recipients, survivors who are needy, will be receiving one-time payments from the Swiss Humanitarian Fund established by the Swiss government in 1997. In both cases, payments from the Swiss banks and other sources like this should be excluded from taxation because they are receiving back what was rightfully theirs to begin with. The sum total of payments coming to the needy Holocaust survivors in the United States from this fund will be $31.4 million. It would be a travesty if the IRS were to decide that these funds would be taxable. 
Mr. President, it is necessary to understand that the survivors who sued the banks and settled in August 1998 did so because this was the only avenue left open to them to seek justice. Deprived of their assets, or those of their families for over 50 years, survivors fought unsuccessfully until now to receive what rightfully belonged to them. 
With the average age of Holocaust survivors at 80, there is little time for debate over these payments which will ease life for the survivors in their final years. To tax them for the long overdue receipt of assets would be wrong. This is why I am offering this legislation. The survivors of man's greatest inhumanity to man deserve justice. After escaping death at the hands of the Nazis, they were again victimized by the Swiss bankers. Now that they have received some measure of justice, let us not take their assets from them again. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support me in this legislation and urge its speedy passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2551, the Medicare anti-duplication bill. This important reform legislation is a necessary step in improving the rights and choices that face New Yorkers. This amendment will in fact correct the language of title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct an unintended consequence of the Federal Medicare anti-duplication law and permits disabled persons to take full advantage of the full range of choices in the health insurance market that are currently available for other New York State citizens. The very narrow legislative change I am proposing will allow several hundred chronically ill New York residents to choose from a variety of health care plans which offer identical health care coverage at lower prices. 
In 1995, New York enacted a `Point of Service' law requiring all HMO's in the state to offer standardized health care benefits to any individual who purchases coverage directly from the plan. However, some individuals that the New York law was intended to help were unable to purchases this coverage. 
The Federal Medicare anti-duplication statue prohibits insurers from selling coverage, other than Medicare supplement coverage, which duplicate benefits available under Medicare. In New York, individuals who were receiving Medicare benefits due to disabilities, were permitted to elect continued coverage of private insurance which were purchased prior to enrolling in Medicare. Prior to 1996 these individuals' choices were limited, and were essentially forced to continue their very expensive Commercial policies. After the `Point of Service' law was enacted, there were numerous policies available which provided identical benefits to the Empire policy, at more affordable prices. 
Those disabled Medicare subscribers enrolled in the Empire policy, however, were prohibited from purchasing these other less expensive policies as a result of the Federal anti-duplication law because the time to elect to continue private coverage had expired. These Disabled individuals numbering between 400-500, were left with essentially one choice, continuing a very expensive commercial policy. 
My anti-duplication amendment will ensure that the disabled New Yorker enrolled in medicare is available to afford a managed care product, and that these purchases will not be considered a `duplicate' of Medicare health benefits. My bill has been drafted specifically to help those several hundred chronically sick individuals in New York, who, prior to 1996, did not have the choice to select one of the many policies which were subsequently required by State Law.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to Commander Lilia L. Ramirez, U.S. Navy, who is retiring after eighteen years of distinguished service to this nation. She stands out as a pioneer, a leader and an outstanding role model for young people in uniform. 
Lilia's United States Navy career is testament to a true American success story. She was born in Bogota, Colombia, and emigrated to the U.S. when she was just five years old. Her parents, Alvaro and Ana Ramirez, were fleeing violence in the Colombian countryside in the early 1960's and sought a new life of security and promise for their children in America. Al and Ana settled in Bayshore, New York, and starting with little more than a confident spirit, went on to raise five extraordinary citizens through hard work, a determination to succeed, and a deep commitment to family. 
Lilia is the eldest of the five children. She spoke only Spanish when she arrived in New York as a five-year-old. But Lilia excelled throughout her public education career, graduating with distinction from Brentwood High School and accepting an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy as a member of the class of 1981, only the second class to have admitted women at Annapolis. 
As a brand new Ensign, Lilia set sail for the Naval Communications Area Master Station Western Pacific in Guam, the first of three overseas assignments. While in Guam, Lilia deployed to the Indian Ocean aboard the submarine tender USS PROTEUS. One of just a handful of women aboard PROTEUS, she crossed the Equator with the ship and was proudly and courageously initiated as a Trusty Shellback in that time-honored sea faring ceremony. 
Assignments in Europe followed, first in England as a Navy-Air Force Liaison Officer at RAF Mildenhall, where one evening on liberty she and two other Annapolis classmates saved the life of an elderly Briton they had come upon who had collapsed from a heart attack. Next she served at the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, as the Officer-in-Charge of the Navy-Marine Corps Element in the headquarters' manpower and personnel directorate. While in Stuttgart, Lilia provided crucial after-action reporting and personnel support in the wake of a terrorist murder of our Naval Attache in Greece and the U.S. Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut. 
After five years overseas, Lilia returned to the Washington, DC area to serve in several assignments, including the Navy Telecommunications Center at Crystal City, at the time the Navy's largest message center; the Navy's Bureau of Personnel, where she was personally involved in assigning a record number of women officers to pursue advanced technical degrees at the Naval Postgraduate School; and the Joint Staff's Command, Control and Communications Systems Directorate. On the Joint Staff, she coordinated the installation of command and control systems in the field offices of Customs, DEA and the North American Air Defense Command as part of our national anti-drug policy. 
In 1990 Lilia was assigned as Officer-in-Charge of the Personnel Support Detachment at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in the state of Washington. In this tour she was responsible for the pay, travel and career advancement matters of 8,000 service members and their families. Lilia returned to the Washington, DC area again in 1992 where she served as base commander of Naval Communications Unit Cheltenham, a 230-acre facility in rural Maryland. At Cheltenham she was responsible for 300 personnel, 19 tenant commands, and environmentally protected wetlands at her base, where she also played host to the local Boys Scouts Troop. 
In 1994 Lilia began a tour in the Secretary of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. Lilia was responsible for representing command, control, communications and tactical intelligence programs to the defense and intelligence committees of both the House and Senate. In addition to numerous informative visits to Naval communications and intelligence facilities throughout the U.S., Europe and Japan, Lilia also escorted congressional delegations to the refugee camps at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to witness national elections in Nicaragua. In 1997 she was part of a team from the U.S. Naval Academy sent to Peru to advise the Peruvian Navy on integrating women into their naval academy. 
Lilia was also a student at the Inter-American Defense College, where she again blazed a trail as the first U.S. Navy woman to attend that institution. She was an impressive ambassador of the U.S. Navy to her Latin American counterparts, where she was able to combine her native Spanish fluency and breadth of experience in national security affairs to forge lasting relationships with key civilian and military leaders of Latin America. She left them with enduring, positive impressions of women as military professionals. 
Lilia's personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal (three awards). 
The Nation owes a debt of gratitude to Lilia Ramirez, whose example will inspire women and Hispanics to seek public service and whose work will continue to have a lasting impact on our armed forces for years to come. While we will miss her distinguished career in uniform, we will no doubt continue to enjoy her commitment to community and nation. I wish to recognize her entire family, including father Alvaro, mother Ana (whom we lost just this year to cancer), brothers Michael and Henry, and sisters Angela and Ana Tulita, all great American success stories in their own right. Best wishes to Lilia, husband Randall Lovdahl (Commander, U.S. Navy), and children Bianca and Beau as they mark this special milestone.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues as original co-sponsor of the revised Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998. This bill reflects a balanced approach in curbing the flow of narcotics over our borders; to stop the drugs before they arrive in the United States. 
Illegal drug use by our children and youth is taking an enormous toll on families and communities all over the country. A study released by the National Institute on Drug Abuse found that cocaine and marijuana use among high school seniors has increased 80% since 1992. Even more alarming is that heroin use among twelfth graders doubled. 
The effects of drugs are astounding. It is estimated that drug-related illness, death and crime cost the United States approximately $67 billion a year. That is $1,000 for every man, woman and child in America. The resources we spend to combat drugs could have been used for so many other valuable social and economic development programs. That is why, after decades of trying to combat the scourge of drugs, we must finally put a stop to it. 
New York State is no stranger to the plight created by illegal drugs. Last year, almost 40% of the heroin seized at our international borders was seized in the New York metropolitan area. This disproportionate amount of drugs destined for New York communities underscores my intention to do what is necessary to end the flow of drugs into our country. 
An effective counter-narcotics control strategy should be balanced and coordinated--including interdiction, prevention and law enforcement. But a disturbing trend has emerged. Since 1987, the percentage of the national drug control budget earmarked for interdiction and international efforts has decreased from 33% to just 12%. That is a trend we intend to reverse with this bill. 
This is an opportunity to make a commitment to substantially reducing drug availability in the United States. In this spirit, the sponsors of this bill have consulted with the Office of National Drug Control Policy to improve on certain aspects of this legislation. But one thing won't change. This bill will provide the necessary resources, $2.6 billion over three years, to increase our interdiction efforts. We can all agree on one thing--we have to stop the drugs before they reach our communities. And it's important to mention that the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a similar bill. 
The Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act of 1998 reaches that goal by providing a comprehensive eradication, interdiction and crop substitution strategy. This initiative will make supply reduction a priority again--guaranteeing valuable equipment for our law enforcement including speed boats at least as fast as those belonging to the drug lords. Our radars and early warning aircraft will be improved so that they will detect the small and elusive drug planes that smuggle tons of narcotics destined for out streets. This initiative will restore balance to the drug control strategy and make significant inroads towards keeping drugs from reaching our neighborhoods, and more importantly, our children. 
This initiative recognizes that drug availability can be decreased by operating against every level of the drug process--from the growing fields to the clandestine laboratories to the trafficking. By continuing to work with reputable law enforcement in narcotic source and transit countries, we may be able to eradicate drugs at their origin. 
The importance of this legislation cannot be underestimated. Everyday, our men and women of law enforcement, at the federal, state and local levels, make great sacrifices as they face the heavy burden of fighting the drug war. They protect the citizens of this country and we should respond by providing them with all the tools they need to get the job done. These people have committed themselves to eliminating illegal drugs from our streets. Now we must demonstrate to them that we will support them in their struggle--a struggle they carry on to protect us. 
I commend the sponsors of this bill for working toward an agreement on this bill and I urge my colleagues to support its enactment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to raise an important issue with chairman of the Commerce Committee. 
I strongly support vigorous competition in the aviation industry. Competition provides greater travel opportunities at lower prices for the people of New York. As the Chairman knows, when discussing increased activities at major airports we must be very mindful of the impact that aircraft noise has on surrounding communities. 
A new start-up airline intends to provide new low-fare jet service out of JFK International Airport and is willing to purchase a number of new Stage III aircraft to place into service in New York. These aircraft will be the quietest aircraft manufactured, even quieter than aircraft that are retro-fitted with Stage III technology known as `hush kits.' In selecting airlines to receive slot exemptions to enhance competition at JFK, the Secretary should give preference to the quietest aircraft willing to fill such slots, which, as I said, would be newly manufactured Stage III jets.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona, the manager of this bill, in a discussion about the growing concern of consumers about airline travel in this country. 
Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1977, the Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998. I introduced this important piece of legislation to address a growing problem in the airline industry. For over three years, the major airlines have been moving to gain more control over the airline travel ticket distribution system. While this effort may seem harmless, the ramifications to consumers are significant. Currently, most air travelers get their information from one of the 33,000 travel agencies around the country. These agencies provide consumers with unbiased and comprehensive air travel information, i.e. the best flight at the cheapest fare. Without that independent source of travel information, there is no doubt that consumers will be paying more, in many cases, substantially more for air travel.

Mr. DAMATO. I thank the Senator. I salute and support the efforts by the manager of this bill to address the competition issue with small airlines. A critical part of a small airline's ability to compete is to have its tickets distributed by an independent entity, mainly the travel agent. Travel agents provide critical services to air travelers, and air travelers depend heavily on travel agents to provide an accurate, broad selection of schedules, fare quotes, and ticketing services for all airlines. 
Mr. President, I ask the Senior Senator from Arizona if Congress should address possible anti-competitive behavior with respect to the airline ticket distribution system?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I naturally would prefer to pass this legislation now and have the Department begin looking into possible anti-competitive activities, but I understand the distinguished Chairman's position. In addition, I realize this FAA Reauthorization legislation must be signed into law by the end of this month, and I do not want to delay it further. I ask the Senior Senator from Arizona if the Commerce Committee could have a hearing on this matter in the near future to thoroughly examine the airline ticket distribution system and the critical role of travel agents for consumers?

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Ilana G. Possner, a young woman who has dedicated her life to the betterment of her community through her undying commitment to community service and leadership activities. She is a shining example of an American youth who has made a deep impact on the lives of her fellow citizens. 
This young Staten Island resident has not only graced her immediate community with her good deeds, but the New York City area as a whole. She is an active participant at Project Hospitality, a Staten Island shelter that works with the area's homeless, hungry and sick. Each week, Ilana prepares and serves dinner to the homeless population this program services. Yet, her role is not just that of a server; Ilana takes it upon herself to befriend these people in need, readily lending a supportive ear and establishing relationships with them. Ms. Possner also devotes her time to entertaining Staten Island senior citizens through volunteer signing for the hearing impaired. Ilana has performed at fifteen different nursing homes and senior citizen centers throughout the past two years. Aside from these very demanding activities, she is also an active and enthusiastic volunteer worker for the American Cancer Society and the Multiple Sclerosis Society. 
Ms. Possner has put her leadership skills to work to help the community, as well. She organizes numerous food and clothing drives for the homeless, which provide people with the basic necessities of life that otherwise would not have been available to them. Moreover, Ilana presides over youth groups which bring together Staten Island youth from different racial, socioeconomic, religious and ethnic backgrounds. Through these groups, she works to promote harmony among the citizens of Staten Island. 
Ilana's hard work has brought her great recognition and awards over the past few years. She currently attends St. John's University on an academic scholarship, where she wishes to pursue studies in Communications and Education. Furthermore, she has received the National Service Scholarship and the MCS/Canon New York Knicks Team Up Community Service Scholarship. The New York State Assembly has also commended Ms. Possner for her work and achievement through a citation, as well. 
As we all know, today's youth is the future of America. In order to solve the problems America is facing now and in the future, it is imperative that we have leaders dedicated to the American people. Ilana Possner is an excellent example of a person who has put forth her leadership skills and time to the American public. It is through people such as Ilana Possner that the future problems and issues facing Americans will be confronted. Thus, I wish to commend Ilana for her selfless acts that have helped to make her community a better place.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am honored to be invited to such a landmark event and I rise to offer my congratulations to the La Salle Academy in celebrating its 150th anniversary of educating New York City's youth. Founded in 1848, the Catholic, college-preparatory school of La Salle Academy currently serves more than 540 young men who represent over 60 nationalities. La Salle Academy seeks to educate young men of New York City from different cultural, racial, and social groups with special outreach programs for those most in need. This enables students to grow intellectually, morally, and physically in a racially diverse setting while encouraging them to contribute to their communities. This fine Academy consistently molds young men into valuable members of society and sends over 90% of its students to pursue higher education. Institutions, such as La Salle, are key assets for introducing our young adults to the many different aspects of our diverse society. Both the graduates and students of La Salle Academy act as model citizens for others to emulate and I praise this institution and other organizations of its kind for its countless contributions to society. We are fortunate to have such a valuable institution reside in New York State. I sincerely hope that La Salle Academy will continue to serve its students and the members of this community in such an important fashion.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to remind everyone that today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On this day, we should remember, give tribute to, and stand in solidarity with the loved ones and families of the thousands of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who were or are Prisoners of War and Missing in Action. I am humbled by and grateful for their love of country and their sense of duty and honor. 
Amidst the somber thoughts, the feelings of gratitude and pride that this day brings, as a Nation we must be uneasy. Uneasy because while we are a nation at peace and the wars in which these men fought are long over, they have not all returned home and we should not rest until their families have their loved ones back. 
These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the constitution and carried that promise through to the ultimate sacrifice for this great nation. While thousands died, many others endured years in starved, tortured, isolated misery before regaining the freedoms we enjoy. Their persistence, integrity and heroism are shining examples of the core values on which this nation was founded and became great. 
Mr. President, we need to produce results. Headway is being made, but there is still a long way to go before we have the fullest possible accounting of all POW/MIA personnel. 
Over the past six years, 136 Americans have been accounted for from Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia thanks to extensive field work. Earlier this month, thanks to the US-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAS established in 1991, seventeen airmen were at long last identified, returned to their native soil laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. These brave airmen were shot down over Soviet Armenia in 1958, during the height of the Cold War. For their loved ones and family members, the long wait is over, but by no means will their loss or sacrifices be forgotten. For many, however, the anguish continues. 
While much of the focus on POW/MIAs has rightly been on Southeast Asia where 2081 personnel remain unaccounted for, we must also honor those who were held prisoner and who are missing in action in other remote parts of the globe. More than 80,000 Americans remain missing and unaccounted for from World War I, World War II and the Korean conflict, and countless others from the Cold War. 
These great Americans and their families have the gratitude of a great and free nation, but we in the Senate shall not rest until all are returned or accounted for. I urge you, Mr. President, the Administration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Agency to redouble their efforts to bring our boys hone as quickly as possible. Let us all take to heart the motto from the POW/MIA flag, which flies over the Capitol today, and which is displayed every day in the Capitol rotunda: `YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN.'

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me at the outset say how tremendously proud and pleased I am that one of my great and dear friends, the Senator from Alaska, has worked so hard and so diligently to attempt to advance a cause that this Nation espouses to so many. 
We talk about the lack of freedom throughout the world. We talk about democracy. Indeed, it is unfortunate that there are strong forces, people who I know and who I respect, who even at this very time give lip service rather than meaningful and true support for that cause. Senator Murkowski understands that freedom and democracy are not something that just should be for some, but should be for all, and that the right of self-determination is an inalienable God-given right. It is one that this country is founded on. People have paid the greatest price and sacrifice with their life, jeopardizing their families, in the fight for freedom and democracy. 
I have to tell Members that it is more than imperative, it is a moral necessity, that we strongly encourage the process of self-determination for 4 million Americans, U.S. citizens who live in Puerto Rico, that they should determine by what rules and what form of government they should live. 
We have for years talked about the lack of democracy in all areas of the world. We talk about it in China, Korea, here, there. We should be ashamed that it has taken us so long to come forth with a rather simple resolution, and that it has taken such an incredible effort by the Senator from Alaska and others, to bring us to this point. This is a pittance in comparison to those who have bled, who have sacrificed for democracy, for self-determination. 
I hope we understand that we want to encourage people, saying the right to vote, the right to determine one's own destiny, is inalienable. 
I would like to have a recorded vote. I would like for us to say: We are going to recognize your hopes and your aspirations and your dreams. It is my hope that the people vote for statehood. But that is their right. They may determine that they want to continue the present situation, but they should have that inalienable right, and we should say to them that we are ready and willing to recognize your choice, your decision, as free men and women, and, yes, that we would be willing and ready to undertake supporting that decision because we respect the inalienable rights of people to make their own determination. 
As we mark the 100th anniversary of Puerto Rico becoming a part of the United States, I think it is important to recognize that their sons and daughters have made the supreme sacrifice. They have answered the call of duty. They have been there. And now it is time for us to say: You can be a part of this great Nation, not just as citizens, but as a State, if you choose, if you determine, and then send your response to us. 
There are those who say it doesn't matter. Well, it does matter, and it is bigger than partisan politics. It is bigger than Republicans and Democrats. I believe that in the fullness of time what an incredible beacon a 51st State might be. But that is for the people of Puerto Rico to determine. What an example to all of Central America and South America, in terms of sharing our cultures, our values, with this island as part of this great Nation. Certainly at the very least, the people of Puerto Rico, our citizens, should have that right which we declare day in and day out is inalienable for people throughout the country, for all corners of the world. 
I congratulate my friends who have brought it to this point, and the Senate majority leader, and Senator Torricelli for his unwavering support of that commitment to justice, to democracy, to self-determination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made by my distinguished friend and colleague, the great senior Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. He touched on the eloquence and passion and the rightness and the moral certainty of Senator Santorum's very cogent argument and presentation. This entire subject, I believe, is uncomfortable for all of us. But it is so necessary. Senator Domenici spoke about the great senior Senator from New York, and I say that because I have great admiration and respect for the senior Senator from New York, who is fearless and courageous in saying that this was infanticide. That is what this is--the killing of a youngster, which is absolutely unnecessary, when the AMA, the American Medical Association, has come out and said there is no reason for this procedure. What are we talking about when we move down this line and say that anyone can do anything, even where we have a life, a new and innocent life? 
And so, Mr. President, I, too, say to my colleague and friend from Pennsylvania, we thank you for having the moral certainty and courage of not giving up and fighting to preserve the opportunity for those lives that have really come into being, to be what they can be and what they should be. When we talk about preserving the sanctity of life, there is no greater fight, no greater cause. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, this amendment would end the monopolistic, anticonsumer, anticompetitive practice of ATM double charges once and for all. It is cosponsored by Senators Chafee, Dodd, Harkin, Bryan, and Moseley-Braun. 
The amendment corresponds to my bill, S. 885, called the Fair ATM Fees for Consumers Act, which currently has 11 cosponsors. It would amend section 903 of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to prohibit ATM surcharges imposed by ATM operators directly upon noncustomers using their machines. 
The big banks would have you believe that if this amendment passes, ATMs are going to disappear. Absolute nonsense. Hogwash. It is simply not true. If they get rid of ATMs, then they are going to have to open up more branches and hire more people, and it is going to cost banks more money. Well, a transaction performed by a teller at a bank branch does cost more money. 
Let's take a look at the genesis of the ATMs. When they were initially introduced to the consumer, great promises were made. Indeed, the banking community, I believe, had the support of just about everybody, including consumer groups, when they said: Look, we're moving into the modern era and the utilization of ATMs will save consumers money, it will reduce transactional costs. 
Those benefits, indeed, were supposed to be passed on to the consumer. It made sense. Indeed, a network was set up--a network owned by Cirrus and Plus, really owned by the large money center banks. Interestingly, in order to induce others who may have started rival networks, they said: Don't worry, use our network, use the ATMs that we establish, because we will prohibit a double charge, a surcharge on top of an initial fee. So, therefore, those who might go into competition, such as the credit unions, the small community banks, and others, do not have to go through the cost and expense of setting up your own ATMs, because we will let your customers use our ATMs without any additional charge. 
Indeed, up until April 1, 1996, the networks prohibited double charges. That was a self-imposition to see to it that all of the financial services that were offered in the banking community would be available, there would be one charge that the consumer's own bank could impose and pass along the money to the ATM operator. The bank would be compensated, but there would not be any additional charge for those who used an ATM that was not their bank's. 
Let me say that the Congressional Budget Office reported that there were more than 122,000 ATMs in the United States before double charges were permitted nationwide. So this rubric, this nonsense, this incredible claim that, `Oh, we are concerned about consumers and their choices, and we're concerned that they won't have these ATMs,' that is just a lot of nonsense. Look at the facts--122,000 of the existing ATMs, or 74 percent, were in place before double charges. 
Now, at last count, there were 165,000 ATMs. So in the past 2 years, you have had approximately 43,000 new machines come into use. That means that 74 percent--three-quarters of all the ATMs in the United States--were in place before they were allowed to double charge. 
Now, under the amendment, which has been cosponsored by many of my colleagues, ATMs would still be profitable. They have been raking in huge profits. 
The banks were saving money because they saved a dollar for each transaction performed at an ATM rather than at a bank branch--and they made a profit on the use of the ATMs. But they weren't satisfied with that. Oh, no. They had to say that: On top of that, we are now going to add another charge. Guess what we are going to tell the consumer? A little flag goes up and says you will pay $1.25 more. 
What is a person who, at lunchtime, has to take out $20, $30, or $40 supposed to do? Go running around looking for an ATM that doesn't have a double charge? No. The people are stuck. They are running late, or maybe it is getting dark. Are you going to go searching for an ATM that doesn't have that little flag going up? Or are they going to look for one that doesn't exist, because their bank, under the inducement years ago that they need not participate and open up their own ATMs, they said, `We will rely on the network rather than try to find that mythical one'? 
If you tried to find one in Washington, DC, you would not find one. Ninety percent of them in this region double charge. If you don't go to the institution where you do your banking, you are going to get whacked. This whacking costs the American people more than $3 billion more--$3 billion. The average family that uses another bank's ATM six times a month is going to pay about $200 a year more. 
Do you know who it hurts? It hurts the little guy. It hurts the person who draws out that $30, $40 or $50, because the surcharge, which averages about $1.27, is paid in addition to the initial charge. Consumer groups have estimated the two charges average about $2.68 together. 
Here is somebody trying to get out their $20 or $30 or $40--a senior citizen, a college student--and there is a $2.68 charge. That is a lot of money coming from the little guy. That is a heck of an interest rate. Years ago that would be called `usury'--usury to get your own money. That is really incredible. 
That is why we have come forth with this amendment. Some people say, `Why are you getting into the private sector?' I will tell you why. What you have today is anticompetitive. Banks say consumers always have a choice to use an ATM that does not double charge. That is a joke. Seventy-nine percent of the ATMs are now double charging. I predict that by the end of the year that number will be over 90 percent. This is a situation where the consumer has little, if any, choice. 
Many of my colleagues have said to me, `What is the big deal? It is only a couple of dollars.' It may not be a big deal to us to pay an extra $3 when you are taking out $100 or $200. But it is a very big deal to senior citizens, to students and to working families who take out $20, $30 or $40 at a time. 
ATM surcharges account for more than $3 billion a year. The fees themselves are skyrocketing out of control. The most common surcharge has increased from $1 to $1.50. That is right, when they introduced it, it started at $1. It is now $1.50. Forty-four percent of the ATMs charge $1.50 or more. It is going to go higher and higher unless Congress acts to stop it now. Keep in mind that this is a charge on top of a fee that the consumer is already paying to his or her own bank. It is a hidden bank fee. But they are paying. 
A recent U.S. PIRG survey found that 83 percent of the banks charge their own customers an average of $1.18 per transaction whenever they use another ATM. When you add the most common charge to the average fee, that is $2.68. That is about $200 a year for a family that uses an ATM six times a month. That is outrageous. 
Several States, including Connecticut--the State of my colleague, Senator Dodd--Iowa, and Massachusetts are waging battles to ban double charges at the State level. But there is a question as to whether these measures would apply to federally chartered banks. 
That is why Congress has to act. It has to act in order to preserve competition--in order to see to it that this monopolistic practice does not deprive people of real choice. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look to help the little guy. This is an opportunity to give them the protection they so desperately need. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I commend both my colleague from Connecticut and Senator Bryan from Nevada for their thoughtful presentations. 
I tell you, when I look at the ATM cartoon over there, that Senator Bryan has put up, it is interesting because that is exactly what is taking place, particularly to so many young people who don't have a choice, to the student who is at his college campus and there are only one or two of those ATMs around and everyone of them is double charging. It is excessive--to think they are paying $2.68 to take out their own money. If you are taking out $30 or $40 at a time, as many of the young people are, and many of our senior citizens, that is usurious by any standard. 
The argument that somehow this is going to hurt competition is rather pathetic. This has really hurt the small banks, the credit unions, because they were deceived into not getting into competition while a huge network was built; 122,000 out of the 165,000 machines were installed well before the double charges. 
Let's take a look and see. Since the double charges, in the past 2 years, have been imposed--17 percent double charged going into 1996. The next year, it jumped to 59 percent. And the following year, 79--79 percent of all of the ATMs are now double charging. They came into existence and were making a profit before the surcharges. This is just a way of really doing what Senator Bryan's description, the chart, showed so eloquently. You are really holding up the consumer, because it is anticompetitive, antichoice. This number, 79 percent--that is temporary. We have seen them grow. You will top out at over 90 percent by the end of next year, there is no doubt. 
So there is little choice. There is no reason. It is anticompetitive, antipeople, and we should have the courage to say enough is enough. Let our States determine whether or not this should be permitted. When the State of Iowa and the State of Connecticut have attempted to ban double charges, surcharges, they have not seen a diminution. But now, even their law will be threatened, and is in court, as it relates to those States that want to protect consumers. So we are whipsawing them both ways, and there is only the Federal Government that can make a difference. 
I hope my colleagues will join with me in voting to give people a real choice without that additional burden being placed on them. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for permitting us the additional time to make known our thoughts and our views.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, my amendment would stop one of the most predatory, outrageous practices that consumers throughout America are facing, double charging at ATMs. There are fewer opportunities to avoid that. Since the ban has been lifted, we have gone from 17 percent of the ATMs double charging to 79 percent in 2 years. There is no consumer choice. At the end of next year, it will be over 90 percent, and it will cost the average consumer $2.68 for that transaction. 
For people who say, `Oh, we'll lose the ATMs if we do not have these double charges,' 74 percent of the ATMs that are in existence today existed prior to the double charges. 
If you want to help the little guy, here is an opportunity. Vote for the ATM ban; vote for the consumer. Give that little guy a choice and give people an opportunity to vote. I am urging people to vote no against the motion to table.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleagues who have given me the opportunity to at least bring this to a vote. Needless to say, the great power and the great number of dollars involved were felt. It is a lot of money that a lot of little people are paying that they shouldn't be paying. 
Indeed, some Members have indicated to me that notwithstanding their opposition to intruding generally into the private sector, they would reconsider their votes in the future if they continue to see the predatory price-gouging practices that are anticonsumer and monopolistic; if they continue to see not only the number of ATMs that are double charging continue, but lack of consumer choice; and escalating fees. 
Indeed, the Senate majority leader told me, and he is on the floor now, that he has indicated to those in the banking community that they had better look carefully at what they are doing. If they continue to impose these fees on the little people, he may not be nearly as supportive. 
This is a close issue as it relates to when should government become involved in the private sector. I believe that time has come. 
Having said that, this is a battle, but it is not the end. I lost this battle, but I am prepared to continue this battle and win the war until and unless we see a rollback in what is taking place now--and that is taking advantage of the consumer, the little guy, the working families of America. 
Again, I thank my colleagues who have yielded me this time to make this observation. We lost the battle, but not the war. 
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to strengthen protections to retirees who, through no fault of their own, find themselves without a job or the pension they worked hard for because their company went under. 
This situation happened in 1991 when Pan Am World Airways went out of business leaving 45,000 employees--15,000 of which reside in New York State--jobless and without their promised pensions. For the last seven years these hardworking Americans have fought a losing battle with the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to get a fair benefit calculation and appeals process. In addition to former Pan Am employees, this issue affects hundreds of thousands of former employees of companies whose pension plans have been taken over by the PBGC. 
Our senior citizens are a valuable resource to this country. Many of them are entitled to receive private pensions as a result of their loyal years of service to their employers. In 1974, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted to provide certain basic protections to retirees regarding their pensions. 
In general, private employers are required to act as fiduciaries with respect to most of their activities in connection with their pension plans. Those fiduciaries are prohibited from commingling plan assets, must provide regular disclosure concerning plan assets and are required to act `solely in the interest' of the participants. Participants may bring suit, in Federal Court, if required information is not provided within 30 days of request. A participant may seek a determination of the amount of his or her benefit, in Federal Court, if the plan fails or refuses to render a determination as to the amount of benefit the participant is entitled to receive under the plan. 
ERISA also created a Federal agency, the PBGC, to pay benefits to participants in pension plans who are unable to pay such benefits. PBGC functions as an insurer, collecting premiums from solvent plans and paying benefits to participants in failed plans. Since the enactment of ERISA, the PBGC has become the Trustee of plans involving more than one million participants. 
While the PBGC does an admirable job with respect to its obligations to continue payments to participants in terminated plans, those participants do not enjoy the same legal protections guaranteed to all plan participants under ERISA. In general, PBGC performs its functions as a government agency and not as a fiduciary. 
Mr. President, in plans trusteed by the PBGC, participants have no right to disclosure regarding the amount of their benefits and may not appeal an adverse determination until an appealable decision is rendered--which in many cases does not occur for more than ten years. Once issued, the PBGC decisions must be appealed within 45 days or a participant may lose all rights. If a determination is appealed, participants must follow a complicated and time consuming appeals process. Many of our senior citizens are confused and overwhelmed by this process and as a result, inadvertently surrender many valuable legal rights. 
In addition, under current law, the PBGC is permitted to commingle funds from all of the retirement plans that it terminates and may use those retirement funds to pay for expenses of other plans as well as its general overhead expenses. 
At a minimum, our senior citizens, in plans trusteed by the PBGC, need and deserve the same protections accorded to every other participant in a plan covered by ERISA. This bill restores some of those protections and requires that the PBGC issue an appealable decision within one year of the date the PBGC becomes the Trustee of a plan. The bill provides for the establishment of participants' committees to represent the interests of the participants and permits such committee to serve as Trustee of the terminated plan. Where more than one group seeks appointment as Trustee the federal courts would be required to select the Trustee that would best serve the interests of the participants. 
My bill also establishes a participant advocates office to assist participants with explanations, benefits disputes and, if necessary, to appeal adverse determinations by the PBGC. In addition, the bill clarifies existing law, empowering the federal courts to remove a Trustee in the event the Trustee commits any breach of it fiduciary duty.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in recognizing Harvey Finkelstein, one of New York's most beloved and esteemed health care executives, as he prepares for his retirement. In a career spanning more than three decades, Harvey Finkelstein, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Jewish Home and Hospital, has been a pillar of New York's continuing care community. This exceptional individual has devoted his life to caring for and improving the lives of the elderly in New York. 
Throughout Harvey's distinguished career, he has demonstrated a great knowledge of and commitment to the field of continuing care. He has served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Jewish Home and Hospital since 1988. Prior to joining the Jewish Home and Hospital, Harvey was the Associate Executive Director of the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center and held positions with Long Island Jewish-Hillside Medical Center and the Queensboro Tuberculosis and Health Association. His sharp intellect combined with his selfless and compassionate spirit have made Harvey a unique leader who is valued and respected by all. 
During Harvey's tenure as President and CEO, the Jewish Home and Hospital has gained widespread recognition as an exemplary long term care organization, developing a reputation of excellence for both its extensive continuum of senior care services and its innovative geriatric education programs. Most important, it has remained ever focused on its essential mission--providing its residents with the opportunity to live lives filled with dignity, meaning, and respect. 
In addition to his professional responsibilities at the Jewish Home, Harvey has also made a wide range of important contributions to the New York health care community. Harvey has taught extensively on topics related to geriatrics and long term care. His teaching includes classes at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, the New School for Social Research, The Brookdale Center on Aging of Hunter College and New York University. Harvey has also published in Journal of Vision Rehabilitation, Contemporary Administrator, and Journal of American College of Emergency Physicians. Harvey has been an active member of several provider associations including the Greater New York Hospital Association and the National Association of Jewish Aging Services. He also advises the UJA-Federation of New York and the Council of Jewish Federations. 
Mr. President, as Harvey Finkelstein looks toward his retirement, I ask my colleagues to join with me in expressing their great appreciation and admiration for all of the contributions and achievements of this exceptional leader. We wish him and his family health and happiness in the upcoming years.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today along with my colleague Mr. Reed of Rhode Island I introduce legislation that will require country of origin marking on imported costume jewelry in order to better inform American consumers about the country of origin of their costume jewelry purchases. 
The jewelry industry in the U.S. consisted of more than 3500 companies and 55,000 American workers in 1994, with sales totaling in the billions of dollars annually. In 1977 imports of costume and fine jewelry were about 14% of the jewelry sales in the U.S. By 1994 the imported costume jewelry sales reached 26% of all costume jewelry sales, and 50% of all fine jewelry sales. This increase in imports led to a decline in employment in the U.S. jewelry manufacturing industry by 26%. Of course we all favor the advantages that come from foreign competition in the marketplace. And we also favor informed consumers. 
Currently, imported jewelry is one of the few products that does not require a country of origin stamp. This bill will require imported costume jewelry to be stamped in English with the country of origin. This eliminates the problem of removal or loss of adhesive labels or tags that state the country of origin prior to reaching the retail store. In this way we respect the integrity of our American workers by removing any question as to the origin of any costume jewelry purchases. This bill is a reasonable and low-cost response that extends the country of origin marking law to cover a product that should be included. 
With the increasing wealth of our country, the sales of jewelry are increasing and those who wish to know the country of manufacture of their jewelry will be easily satisfied by a simple stamp or imprint on these items. This jewelry should be subject to same rules as all other imports. The industry trade group, The Manufacturers, Jewelers, and Silversmiths of America, also support this bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important pro-consumer legislation to protect the privacy of confidential financial information for every American. The Financial Information Privacy Act will make it a federal crime to obtain or attempt to obtain private consumer information from our nation's financial institutions through the use of false, fictitious or fraudulent statements. 
Mr. President, the exploitation of personal information by unscrupulous `information brokers' and individuals attempting to pry into the private financial affairs of others is an issue of vital concern to every American. 
A flourishing industry of `information brokers' has emerged as detailed in hearings held just last month by the House Banking Committee. These individuals use deceptive practices, such as lying about their identity on the phone, in order to obtain personal customer information for resale. Armed with personal information such as bank account balances, account numbers and transaction activity, this information can be used to build a profile of a consumer which can be bought and sold in the marketplace. Advances in technology have enabled information brokers to inexpensively create enormous databases of individual profiles and use the Internet to market their information worldwide. 
Mr. President, these same techniques are used by criminals to obtain information to create fraudulent credit applications that can quickly destroy a victims credit worthiness and require months of effort to clear up. The problem is growing exponentially. One of the leading credit reporting services reports that since 1992, the number of financial fraud cases where individuals have pretended to be another person has risen from 32,000 to more than 500,000 in 1997. I believe the evidence is clear that inadequate financial privacy laws are a significant factor in this rise. Americans demand and rightfully expect the privacy of personal financial information. 
While existing laws do provide protection against unfair and deceptive practices, there is no federal law that expressly prohibits acquiring personal customer account information under false pretenses. Banking groups and federal regulatory agencies have all testified that this legislation would be an important tool to protect consumers from the invasive practices of information brokers. Passage of this measure will make it clear that Congress will not tolerate this invasion of privacy and will do whatever is necessary to insure that the private financial information of our citizens remains private. 
Mr. President, in closing I want to comment Chairman Leach for his quick action in the House to move this measure forward. Working together with our House colleagues, we have an opportunity to greatly strengthen the privacy laws that safeguard the personal financial information of every American. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this vital legislation.

I am deeply, deeply pleased and believe that we have a Customs Commissioner of whom we can be proud, who will do the kind of outstanding work that Ray Kelly has done over the years in law enforcement. 
He is a native New Yorker. He spent quite a bit of his time as a young man in the village of Island Park, where I live and grew up. So it is a great pleasure to see him come to this highly regarded position. I know he is going to be an outstanding Commissioner, and I look forward to working with him.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague, Senator Mack, to introduce the MERIT Act. The MERIT Act seeks to reward those teachers who provide, day in and day out, magic in the classrooms, to reward them with a salary to match their importance. We should develop a methodology of rewarding those truly outstanding teachers and seeing to it that we keep them, retain them. Truly outstanding teachers are the unsung heroes of our communities. Unfortunately, however, great education does not take place for every child in every classroom, and that is sad. But it is something we can strive for and work to change. 
The bill that Senator Mack and I introduce comes on the heels of receiving some discouraging news, news from Massachusetts where a test of prospective teachers was given and nearly 60 percent of them failed. It was a test at the eighth-grade level. I firmly believe that most New York teachers are very good. But, nonetheless, I must ask the question, Why not have the best? Why not reach out to them? Why not attract them? 
The Massachusetts test was a good idea, but we should also give periodic competency tests to teachers who are already in the system. Most teachers are very dedicated and highly competent, but some are not. Some teachers who are highly skilled in one or two subject areas may be forced to teach other subjects in which they lack the competence. When that happens, our children are the ones who suffer. 
Another desperately needed reform is merit pay for outstanding teachers. We must reward the best teachers. In most of our Nation's schools there is no financial incentive for the truly outstanding teachers. Great teachers, who help our children achieve educational excellence, should be rewarded. 
The measure introduced today by Senator Mack and myself, the MERIT Act, is the same measure that passed the Senate on April 21 by a vote of 63 to 35. This legislation provides incentives for States to establish periodic teacher assessments and merit rewards. Incentives are provided through the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The measure sets aside 50 percent of the funds appropriated over the fiscal year 1999 levels in the program, and then distributes them to States that have established teacher testing and merit pay. Last year, fiscal year 1998, Congress appropriated $335 million for this program to subsidize training for teachers. That is an increase of $25 million from the year before. Should we not be able to use this program to ensure that teachers are actually improving their teaching skills, as well as substantive knowledge? Teacher testing will help accomplish that goal. 
But let me be clear. As the Eisenhower Professional Development Program funding increases, so will each State and local government's share, with 50 percent of the increase reserved for those States that put in place a mechanism by which to periodically measure the ability, knowledge, and skills of teachers, and implement a pay scale to reward those determined and dedicated teachers. When we look at reforming our public schools, one thing must always be kept foremost in our efforts, and that is, we must put our children first. Our children are the best and the brightest. They are our most precious resource. 
So, when it comes to recruiting and retaining the best young professionals, I believe, in order to do that, we are going to have to pay them adequately. We are going to have to reward their accomplishments and see to it that the truly outstanding are rewarded with merit pay so we can assure our children get that opportunity. I hope our colleagues will join in this effort to improve America's schools and help prepare our children for the 21st century.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, pleased to urge bipartisan support for and passage of H.R. 3506, the Gerald R. and Betty Ford Congressional Gold Medal Act. 
Mr. President, this bill commemorates a number of anniversaries that few individuals succeed in reaching. This year is quite a milestone for our former thirty-eight President and First Lady. First and foremost, Gerald Ford celebrated his 85th birthday on July 14 and Betty Ford celebrated her 80th birthday on April 8. 
This October marks another anniversary well worth mentioning--the 50th wedding anniversary of Gerald and Betty Ford. In 1948, they were wed only a few weeks before Gerald Ford won his first term in the House of Representatives. The Fords returned to Washington every term thereafter until 1974. Gerald Ford served as House Minority Leader from 1965 to 1973. 
And finally Mr. President, this year commemorates the 25th anniversary of Gerald Ford becoming the first Vice President chosen under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Less than a year later, he succeeded the first President ever to resign. 
President and First Lady Ford led our country with bravery and dignity during a time that he declared upon his inauguration, `. . . troubles our minds and hurts our hearts.' Gerald Ford was faced with seemingly unsurmountable tasks when he took the oath of office of the Presidency on August 9, 1974. There were the challenges of mastering inflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic energy shortages, and trying to ensure world peace. 
For their first twenty five years in Washington, Betty Ford not only was instrumental in rearing the four Ford children, she supervised the home, did the cooking, undertook volunteer work, and took part in the `House wives' and `Senate wives' for Congressional and Republican clubs. In addition, she was an effective campaigner for her husband. In 1974, Mrs. Ford set aside personal need for privacy when she openly discussed her experience from radical surgery for breast cancer. She reassured troubled women across the country with her openness, care and bravery. 
H.R. 3506, a bill authorizing the President to award Gerald R. and Betty Ford the congressional gold medal, passed the House by unanimous consent on July 29, 1998. It is my sincere hope that the Senate act expeditiously on this legislation. 
Mr. President, this honor, the highest award bestowed by the United States Congress, is a fitting tribute to life-long public service and dedication bestowed upon the American people by the thirty-eight President and First Lady, Gerald and Betty Ford. In addition, it is a wonderful way for all of Congress to commemorate and congratulate the Fords on their fifty years of commitment to one another. On behalf of all my colleagues, I wish them many more happy years together.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me say that I am deeply appreciative of the problem that my good friend, the senior Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, expresses as it relates to community banks. I believe they do need help. Indeed, I think we have to give them some tax relief. I think we can and we should. That is why I have cosponsored the Small Business Financial Institution Tax Relief Act. I believe Senator Shelby is also a cosponsor. And I believe the Presiding Officer is a cosponsor as well. There are other things we can do. 
I think we have to examine CRA as it applies to those who have outstanding records year after year. Should they be subjected to the same compliance requirements or shouldn't there be some way to relieve them of the annual reporting process? Shouldn't there be more flexibility, if an institution has been exemplary for X number of years? Let us discuss that in a different arena and let us not put it on this bill. We can work towards a solution on this important issue and other relief for small banks so they can continue to compete and serve in communities that otherwise would be left without. 
So I am sympathetic to the issue of CRA. But again, to put it on this bill, when the administration said clearly they will veto it, I say, will only undo all the effort put into preserving credit unions and making them safer and sounder. I urge restraint on the part of my colleagues, notwithstanding the fact that we need to do something to help that segment of our community which is so vital--the community bank.

Mr. DAMATO. I not only give that assurance to you, but to all of my colleagues in the Senate and the House. I think we can do a better job ensuring that small community banks have the ability to compete. We will address some of the requirements that are placed upon them that preclude them from using chapter S corporations in the bill Senator Allard has introduced. And while we are at it, we will review some of the regulatory requirements for reporting as required by CRA and we will look for ways to diminish the burdens these requirements place on banks that have exemplary CRA records. 
That would be the absolute priority of this Senator, starting now. We will begin with holding hearings, and from the information we gather, we will craft and seek the support of legislation. Certainly I think next year we will be able to come forth and pass, in both Houses, and get signed into law, the kind of relief that does not jeopardize the legitimate use of CRA but, by the same token, does not compromise those institutions that are doing a good job. 
I believe my colleagues on the Democratic side would join with us in that effort, but not here, not now, without study and careful craftsmanship. 
Again, I understand the need to make these reforms.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues, not only for the final vote on this important legislation, but for the manner in which an excellent debate was conducted. I very much appreciate Senator Lott scheduling this important bill. But a special commendation is in order to a number of people, starting with the ranking member, my friend, Senator Sarbanes. I thank him for his steadfast support in developing the opportunity for Members to be heard, and for Members to have their concerns listened to, and debated, resulting in final passage of the bill, notwithstanding some very contentious issues. I believe that the credit unions, not only of Maryland but of this country, have a demonstrated champion in Senator Sarbanes. 
The fact is that credit unions support the little guy. Historically, credit unions have invested in people and in communities when others would not--yes, when others would not. 
Credit unions have provided the basic financial services without excessive fees, and they continue to do that. We need them in this day of consolidations and megamergers to be out there to service all communities, especially the small communities and, again, the little guy. I don't mean `little' in terms of size and stature, because they are the hard-working, middle-class Americans who are the backbone of this country. Indeed, they set a standard and they challenge, even when others don't like that challenge. 
And likewise, there may be unfair burdens on some of the community banks, and we have to deal with that challenge. But you don't do it at the expense of an organization of the thousands and thousands of credit unions and the hundreds and hundreds of members who work in these credit unions on a voluntary basis, without pay, and in many cases, without any compensation. 
Yes, truly, America can be proud of our credit unions. Credit unions care about hard-working Americans. 
None of this could have been possible without staff because I believe that we have had the best staff that anyone could have, both Republicans and Democrats, working to bring about substantial improvements over the legislation that came from the House--I mean substantial. 
For the first time, we set rigorous standards to protect the taxpayers of the United States--that is right--to protect them. For the first time, we limit--and I think prudently so--commercial lending activities that credit unions can undertake while giving them the opportunity to continue doing so and to continue serving their communities. And again, I believe we applied limits to commercial lending in a prudent manner. 
Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the hard-working staff, a bipartisan staff. I want to acknowledge Senator Sarbanes' staff--Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg and Dean Shahinian. And Phil Bechtel, Madelyn Simmons, Rachel Forward, and our staff director Howard Menell, I thank them for their hard work on this bill. They have done a unique job in working together, never allowing political differences to interfere with the people's work. 
Let me say, Mr. President, that the House is to be applauded for moving so speedily on their legislation. I hope that they will accept the improvements that we have made without the necessity of going to conference. Representatives Kanjorski and LaTourette took the lead on this bill in the House. I am hopeful they will view the Senate's well-considered modifications to the original bill as positive changes to enhance the safety and soundness of credit unions and expedite the enactment of this legislation. 
I also commend Chairman Leach and the House leadership in sending us H.R. 1151 as speedily as they did, because were we not to have gotten it in such a timely manner, we could never have completed the legislative changes that we have made part of the legislation. 
Mr. President, again, I thank all of my colleagues for their outstanding work and for their cooperation, notwithstanding the differences that may have existed. We passed a good bill for working Americans. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to take time out of our busy schedule to recognize the bravery and valor of U.S. Capitol Police Officers John M. Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut. These two fine officers were killed in the line of duty while protecting our Nation's Capitol building and protecting those who pass through this great building. They died fulfilling their sworn duty to protect the public, and they did so in an exemplary way. They are heroes who saved many lives by their actions. 
I remember a period of time after the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993 when law enforcement officials informed me of threats against my life. The Capitol Police quickly formed a detail for my protection. Officer Gibson was a member of this detail. I feel a personal loss. This man was willing to lay down his life for mine and, in fact, he did for others. 
Tomorrow we will pay homage to their memory as they lay in honor beneath the majestic Rotunda in the very building in which they gave their lives to protect. 
The thoughts and prayers of this great body, as well as that of the Nation, goes out to the families and friends of Officers Gibson and Chestnut.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation, Inc. for their continued efforts in the battle against breast cancer. The fight against breast cancer is one that everyone must join in together. Unfortunately, Mr. President, New York has one of the highest incidence rates of breast cancer in the country. 
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women with over 2.6 million living with it presently in the United States. The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation has taken an active role in trying to solve this problem by sponsoring a nation wide tour across 44 states and fifty major metropolitan areas in an event known as the Pony Express Tour. 
The women cyclists began as a group to inspire other women to take up the avocation of and interest in the motorcycling industry. As the organization grew, the foundation decided to enlarge its perspective by voting in 1992 to use its collective passion for motorcycling as a vehicle to raise money for breast cancer research. It was further decided that the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation would be the main recipient of the Foundation's efforts. The Komen Foundation is the largest private organization in the world whose sole aim is eradicating breast cancer. 
The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is comprised of a large number of national, international and independent clubs and associations. Each organization provides the particular activities, values, character and personality that works for its particular membership. Having always been a non-profit organization, it has recently evolved into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is presently articulating its Mission Statement through activities to raise money for the Komen Foundation. 
During the summer of 1993, the Foundation participated in the Women's Arctic Tour and raised $25,000 for the Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Then, in 1996, these women raised 12 times that amount when they rode across the nation in the Pony Express Tour. The Pony Express Tour '98 has set a goal of $500,000 for the 500,000 lives that will be lost to this deadly disease in just this decade. The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation has also been recognized with two national awards. The American Motorcyclist Association and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation both honored them for their positive contributions and dedication to a cure. 
The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation is to be commended for their dedication and desire to find a cure for this deadly disease. It is through their concentrated efforts that they provide both the money and awareness to American women in the fight against breast cancer. I am extremely proud of The Women's Motorcyclist Foundation's commitment and I encourage other organizations and associations throughout the country to search for innovative ways of not only providing funds for breast cancer research, but information and awareness to women of all ages so that we may be able to detect this cancer in its earliest stages.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment submitted by the Senator from Nebraska. 
I don't believe that the Senator intends to hurt the credit unions, but I think an unintended consequence of his amendment will impose some very real burdens, burdens on 4,000-plus credit unions, the small mom-and-pop credit unions, by including in that cap those loans that are made for $50,000 and under. And, indeed, they are made to the members who want to start businesses, who have an idea, and they believe, given sufficient capital, they can go out there and take an entrepreneurial idea, or maybe they have been working for someone and want to start that business with a small loan. Who better to know and judge than a fellow member? Indeed, it requires a burden as it relates to the kind of people who will now have to be utilized to make that loan. That is a burden. Are we now going to be getting in there, micromanaging the small, well-capitalized credit union with better than 7 percent, 8 percent, 9 percent? I think that this will have an unintended consequence. I know it will. I have heard from people inside credit unions. They have told me. 
Now, Mr. President, people will ask, how do we get to 7 percent? And, by the way, how did we get to 12.25 percent? Those are interesting questions. Who determines where a credit union s business lending should or shouldn't stop? Let's start with the history of this provision. 
There was no limitation, Mr. President, none whatsoever, prior to the markup. There wasn t any in H.R. 1151. We approached this in the best way we could. There were no risk-based standards. For the first time we set them up, and we say 7 percent for well-capitalized. That was never intended to be the criterion--to say, `Therefore, you can only make commercial loans up to 7 percent.' 
To take one application when we, for the first time in the history of the credit union movement, say, `Well-capitalized, 7 percent; adequate capital, 6 percent; and, by the way, if you go under that 6 percent, you can't make any commercial loans,' I think that is a tremendous step, because we recognize we can't do business as usual. We want to protect the taxpayer, and that is exactly what we did. 
We came up with 12.25 because we did not want to create chaos, and we wanted to give those who were involved in commercial loan activity an opportunity to disengage without creating a problem that would be difficult, if not impossible, to handle. By setting that, there will still be a significant number at 12.25 percent. There will be 85 institutions that make 5,400 loans for $250 million, and they will be given 3 years to comply with the cap. So we looked at institutions, and we looked at the numbers of members and we arrived at a number. 
The amendment at the desk, in addition to creating a burden that is going to be very difficult for small credit unions to make in terms of who can and can't grant these business loans, it now picks up an additional number of institutions. Mr. President, 177 already exceed the cap. We are talking about well-capitalized institutions that are making loans, have been making loans, and don't have problems, and because we arbitrarily come to 7 percent--and I say `arbitrarily.' There is no reason to suggest again that because we deem a bank to be well-capitalized at 7 percent, therefore, we should cap the whole industry at 7 percent. I don't understand it. We will now throw 8,700 of those loans, $360 million, and 177 institutions into an area where they have to begin to disengage to get under this arbitrary number. And it is arbitrary. 
We worked with the credit unions for quite a while and with the administration in attempting to come to a number. They weren't happy about our imposing these standards, but we did because it was the right thing to do to protect the taxpayer. 
Let me say this to you. Let's look at the totality of this. The unintended consequences of this are going to say, where we have some well-run institutions that are providing their members and their community with these loans and, obviously, there is a need for them, that we are going to preclude them and say, `Oh, no; just 7 percent.' 
Heretofore, we had no limit. I think really we can second-guess everybody and anything, and we can make an appeal to the community bankers: `We're your best friends, because look what we did.' Do I really think that is what we should be engaging in? I hope not. Only 13 percent of all of the institutions--that is, 1,551 out of 11,000--make these loans. 
Let me leave you with one last thought. If every institution were able to--and I am talking about every credit union, all 11,000, recognizing that only 13 percent make commercial loans--were to be engaged in business lending, the total would come to something under $40 billion nationwide by 11,000 institutions. 
Come on, I say to my colleagues, let's be serious. What are we trying to do here? That would be approximately 3 percent of all the commercial loans, $1.1 trillion in commercial loans that are out there. 
What are we doing? What are we saying? I think what we are doing is trying to say we are the friend of the community banker, and this is what we are going to do, we are going to be limiting these folks. Instead of saying we have limited, instead of saying this bill does now limit, this bill does have criteria which we never had before, we are going to one-up it, and that is not going to help. 
You may say the credit unions will accept this. I have to tell you, we will go to conference, and little does one know what will take place when we get into that conference. I would like to avoid that. I would like to say we have done something that even the Secretary of the Treasury has supported in his letter to Majority Leader Lott.

Mr. DAMATO. The letter is addressed to Senator Lott, the majority leader, with copies sent to myself and Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member. He concludes by saying: 
We believe that existing safeguards--together with such new statutory protections as the 6 percent capital requirement, risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and the system of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to the safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending. 
Mr. President, I believe the 7 percent will constitute a very real and severe burden and hardship. As I mentioned, 85 credit unions already exceed the cap. It is mischief making. The unintended consequences will not improve the safety and soundness of credit union operations. That is just not the case. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Let me address something here. Let's put this in perspective. For the first time, this committee has limited, limited severely--there were no limits before now--when you said you can't do more than 12 1/4 percent of your assets. If every institution were to do that--which they are not and no one says they are, not even the proponents of this legislation claim that they are going to be doing this--you still would amount to less than 3 percent of all of the commercial loans, if every credit union maximized its commercial loan potential, and they are not doing that. There is no effort to do so. 
To come in and arbitrarily say, `No, no, now we will take a limit'--you place a limit of 12 1/4 percent--`but this is not good enough, so we will lower to 7. In addition, now we will take the small loans that 5,000 of these institutions make and we will require you to have a person with 2 years' business lending experience on staff to make even the smallest of loans.' 
I wonder if my friend knows that is one of the provisions in this amendment. 
Now, let's take a look--you will hear that this lending cap is to `Save the taxpayer.' That is hokum. If you took all of the `chargeoffs' on bad loans, it is .23 percent from commercial banks. And guess what? Credit unions are at .19 percent. 
Again, we are for the first time imposing strict standards that credit unions never had before. Now my gosh, if we came with the same bill that the House put here, then I would be here to join my colleague in saying: `No, we need to make sure that they are well capitalized. No, we will not let banks that are not adequately capitalized and that are in trouble make loans. No, we are going to see to it that you have the kind of loan offices that commercial banks have.' 
Why do we want to weight this down? How many angels on the head of a pin? That is the type of debate we are having. Should it be 7 percent? Well, why did we come up with 12 1/4 ? Because there would be some disruption, but credit unions could handle it. Now we want to go in and create a situation where you will have 177 credit unions that now make 8,700 loans, $360 million, and they will have to begin to disengage. Will some of the commercial banks like that? Sure, sure they will. 
Let's understand what this will do. Some of the small bankers, you can go back and say, `Look what we did, we got them out of the business.' That is what it comes down to. I just suggest, if the Senator's amendment is serious, why not go to 6 percent or 5 percent? 
What about the tax issue? I have heard more mutterings about that. There is a genuine effort because people don't like the competition. In some cases they perceive it as unfair, and, indeed, where a small community bank is paying taxes and he is side by side with a local credit union that is every bit as large and they are doing a good job and they are not paying taxes, I understand and I feel for that person. 
I am cosponsoring the legislation offered by our good friend from Colorado, Senator Allard, who has introduced a way to begin to help some of the banks. Maybe we have to look at other ways in which we can help community banks. But let's not unfairly go from where we had no cap whatever with a good-faith effort, working with the administration, working with the National Credit Union, working with the credit unions themselves. We came to 12 1/4 percent and somebody says, `No, we can do better; we will make it 7 percent.' There is no rationale, no tie-in, to the amount of the commercial loans. If you had a staggering loss coming from commercial loans, I would say yes, do it. There is no evidence of it. The record does not support that. So why are we doing it? 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me address something, because the more you get into this, you begin to learn. 
Soundness and safety: It is an issue that we are all concerned about, because we have been here. We have gone through this. And we have seen some extraordinary situations, which cost the taxpayers. That is why the committee, the ranking member, and the Republicans and Democrats working together, said we have a structure for the first time of provisions that will address that--we have done that--risk-based capital, based upon soundly capitalized institutions--6 percent for some, and 7 percent for the others-- 
and giving to the administration the ability to close these places down. 
Now, look, when we start talking about commercial loans posing a problem historically and looking at where we are today, they haven't. That is a canard. Indeed, if we take a look and see what it constitutes in terms of their total portfolios, it is under 2 percent. All of their loans are under 2 percent without any limitation. 
So let me suggest to you, I think when we come in and say we are going to limit business lending no matter what, we are saying to each credit union, those that do--forget about the thousands that don't--under no circumstances are you going to go up over 12.25. To say that safety and soundness is going to be protected because somehow we are limiting commercial loans, that doesn't square up with the facts. It just does not. If, indeed, the credit union commercial loan failure rate has been less than those same loans made by commercial banks, how can you say that limiting this activity will provide greater safety and soundness? 
That is the record. The failure rate has been less from credit unions than it has from commercial banks in commercial lending, and they loan less, including the loans for under $50,000. And why are we opposed to counting those loans for less than $50,000? I will tell you why. Because you are going to keep honest people honest. Maybe I shouldn't say this because the guy who is the entrepreneur who wants that loan will come to his credit union. OK, they say it is a commercial loan, and you are going to begin getting into businesses or classifying whether it is personal or whether it is commercial. So they said, look, up to $50,000, we know the people; they are dealing within the institution. It is a member. We are not going to get into the business of classifying whether it is commercial or not. We are going to say, presumptively, any loan up to $50,000 gets an exemption. We don't go through this business of having to classify these loans then have staff making loans meet certain experience levels which this amendment does. 
The present situation is that for making those business loans over $50,000, you must have 2 years of lending experience. 
Now, why did the National Credit Union Administration do that? Because they recognized the need as credit unions got into loans of higher cost and more exposure. It is prudent to have somebody on staff who has that experience. That is why they did it. 
Now the consequence of this amendment will be a burden where credit unions are going to have to hire loan officers to make small, commercial loans of $25,000, $20,000, $15,000, or $30,000. Do you really think that this isn't going to have an adverse impact on the small credit union that would have to do this? Heretofore, small business loans were on the basis of knowing that member, knowing that he or she has a good record, knowing that there is a good business investment opportunity. 
Now, look, in addition to that, we have tightened those standards and said credit unions can't even make business loans unless they hit certain criteria of capital. We didn't have any capital standards before. Yet, I think when one says this is safety and soundness, it is not. The record doesn't indicate that. 
What it is--and I respect those who say we want to limit their ability to develop this business and say under no circumstances will it be more than what your capital is--that is what it is doing. It is limiting the ability of credit unions to involve themselves in commercial lending. 
I think including the $50,000 loans will be going too far. That is why the credit union people and people who represent small businesses urge that we not support this amendment because what it will do is make it harder to get loans. I have a letter from the Small Business Survival Committee. I am going to ask it be made a part of the record. The American Small Business Association similarly asked us not to restrict the availability of commercial credit any further. 
Times are booming today, but they may not always be booming. Then where do people go? Now you can go to your local bank, and they seem to have plenty of money to go around. What happens when things tighten up? Then we are going to make it difficult, if not impossible, for people who would have had the ability, if necessary, to go to their credit unions and to get maybe that $25,000 small business loan.

Mr. DAMATO. I do not know how many Members would like to speak to this, but I would think, given the time situation that we have, that those Members on either side who would like to either speak on the bill or state their support or opposition to the amendment that is now pending, that they should attempt to do so. Because at 3:30, I believe, Senator Shelby will be coming down to the floor in order to offer his amendment, and we will then lay aside this amendment for the purposes of discussing the amendment put forth by my colleague from Alabama. Then thereafter, from 4:30 to 5:30, Senator Gramm of Texas is scheduled on the floor where we will then entertain the Gramm amendment, which will be the pending business and which will be the vote that we take up at 5:30. I believe at that point my colleague, the ranking member of the committee from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, will make a motion to table. And with that the votes will begin. 
So my suggestion, to those colleagues who would like to be heard on this amendment or on the overall bill, is that they use this time to come to the floor within a half hour because I think the schedule will then begin to get somewhat crowded. 
If no one is seeking recognition, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I have spoken to this issue before, so I am going to try to make my remarks very succinct. That is difficult for me, I realize that, but there are others waiting. The Senator from Kansas has been on the floor for 2 hours and the Senator from Massachusetts is waiting to speak also. 
I share the concerns that my colleagues have raised regarding the fairness of what would appear to be overreaching in certain cases involving our community banks. I believe we need to have a full and thorough hearing to look at this question and examine it. Not just one hearing, but a comprehensive study and a series of hearings to see if we cannot advance the goals. Because I don't think there is anyone, anyone, who is opposed to the goals of ensuring that there is capital available in our rural areas and our small communities. Capital that might not otherwise be there were it not for CRA. 
The question is, Is that capital being made available? How effective is CRA? Or has there been an unexpected consequence from the impact of the legislation and the compliance requirements? And has that consequence been so overwhelming as to keep the small banker from doing his job? Those are legitimate questions. We should review this important issue in its entirety and we should examine it. 
But we should not offer an amendment now that would in any way make it impossible for this bill to go forward. That is exactly what would take place. There is no way, no way, that we could get sufficient votes nor would the administration enact legislation if the CRA provision was stripped out. I say `stripped out' because that is, indeed, what the amendment would do. The Shelby amendment would literally strip it out. 
There is no way for evaluating if a bank had proven itself year after year and earned a relaxation in its examination schedule so it would be reviewed less frequently or even periodically. That is the kind of thoughtful consideration that we need to do. 
This doesn't say, well, let's look at giving better tax treatment to the smaller community banks so that they can do their job. And, for example, Senator Allard has worked long and hard on developing a proposal that would do that. That is the kind of thing we have to do. But to come in here now and suggest that we simply strip out CRA for all community banks would be wrong. 
And you can say that you favor credit unions, but if you vote for this amendment, what you are doing is taking a chance that credit unions will have irreparable damage done to them. So I am going to urge my colleagues to support the motion to table Senator Shelby's legislative effort. As well intended as it may be, it should not be here.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:45 on Tuesday, the Senate resume consideration of the Shelby amendment, and there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a motion to table. I further ask consent that no amendments be in order prior to the vote. This has been cleared by both sides.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I would like to take up to 5 minutes. 
I support the Senator's efforts, the efforts of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm. As strenuously as I have argued against the inclusion of legislation that would affect community banks and CRA, I do not believe this is the time for us to go forward and place the same CRA provisions, which are so controversial as they relate to community banks, on the backs of credit unions.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, there is no evidence that people are not getting credit that they should be getting. This legislation is ill conceived, to place these burdens on these small credit unions and credit unions that are by their nature nonprofit and voluntary. I don't understand this. To paraphrase the statement that has been used often, `This is a solution in search of a problem.' We don't even have a problem and we are coming up with a solution. 
Let's look and see what the National Credit Union Administration says. These are the people who are going to draw the rules enforcing this vague open-ended legislation. Listen to what they say about implementing the legislation that imposes the CRA requirements: 
This will be a time-consuming and difficult process, as the Board will have to agree on the meanings of terms such as `periodically' and `criteria.' 
This legislation, as it is written, is ambiguous. This is not the time for my colleagues to be putting this kind of legislation into law. This proposed legislation is wrong. The letter from the National Credit Union Administration goes on and says: 
. . . after a public comment period which will run for several months. Staff expects that developing the community service regulation will be the most challenging part of implementing H.R. 1151. 
My gosh, there you have the people who are going to administer these CRA provisions, as well-intentioned as they might be, saying that developing the community service regulation will be the most challenging part of implementing H.R. 1151. The National Credit Union Administration is saying that this is going to be the most difficult part of the law. Furthermore, there is no community service problem that is outstanding. I don't think we want to engage in this type of legislation. 
Last but not least, let me say what we should be doing and what the administrator of the credit unions, the National Credit Union Administration, should be doing is concentrating on seeing to it that those few credit unions that may have trouble with their capital standards, et cetera, are subject to the prompt corrective action provisions in the bill so that the taxpayers are protected. 
Let's protect the taxpayers, and let's see to it that credit unions do what they have done best, and that is to be available to the community that often has had difficulty getting credit. That is what this is about. That is what this legislation should be about. 
As strongly as I am opposed to an attempt to strip out CRA from community banks, it is ill conceived to place these kinds of legislative prerogatives and requirements on credit unions that are not even adequately defined and that the National Credit Union Administration itself says will be the most difficult to undertake. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. I am moving to table this amendment because we have had for years no limitations on credit unions and their loans commercially. And, by the way, with all that with no limitations, only 1.3 percent were made for commercial purposes. Now we impose 12.25 percent. We limit them. And to say that we are not doing something when we place restrictions on them and you want to go further, I think this is wrong, it is ill conceived, and that is why I will move to table. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today, we consider H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, which is critical legislation. It is legislation necessary to preserve the ability of all Americans to join the credit union of their choice, and to ensure that 73 million Americans who are currently members of a credit union in no way have their membership status jeopardized. 
Credit unions work, Mr. President. They work for working families, they work for the little guy. And in their hour of gravest need, it is time for Congress to work for them. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as enthusiastically as our friends in the House did--by an overwhelming vote of 411-8. I am confident that we will act to preserve the rights of all Americans to join credit unions now and into the future. 
Mr. President, this legislation was crafted in response to a Supreme Court ruling that was decided on a very narrow legal point, handed down on February 25 of this year. That ruling placed 20 million Americans in immediate jeopardy and tens of millions of others of being kicked out of the credit unions they belong to. Who are these Americans? They are small business employees and small business owners, low- and moderate-income earners, farmers, laborers, church members--the hard-working American men and women who have a right to affordable financial services as much as anyone else. 
For decades, the American dream has been made a reality by credit unions. These cooperatives reach out to individuals, associations and communities who have had the door slammed in their faces by other financial institutions. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the economy, while strong today, the economy--such that people can get loans for a variety of reasons--may not always be that strong. I hope it is. But if history is any reminder of what may be in the future, there will be difficult times. 
It has always been the credit union that has given to the little guy, the forgotten middle class--I don't mean little in terms of size and not as a pejorative, but indeed I am talking about the backbone of this country--the opportunity to look his or her neighbor in the eye, who knows that they are good and who knows they will work to pay back that loan, as opposed to somebody 2,000 miles away who doesn't even see that person, who gets an application, who views it in terms of what the income is or the fact that the person is out of work, or the fact that the person has a small farm and is running against tough times and says, no, and turns them down. 
It has traditionally been the credit union neighbor, knowing a neighbor employee, working next to his co-employee, recognizing their needs, making that money available so they can send their kid to school. It is one of the great strengths of this country, and it gives us economic diversity, it gives people choice, and it provides competition. 
There are those who do not like competition, who set up a whole series--almost a canard as to, `Oh, no; credit unions are a problem.' They are a problem, because they give people affordable opportunities to borrow at the lowest rates, because they don't pay income taxes. Why? They are not paying dividends out to people. Where do those moneys go? Those moneys go so that additional loans are available to their members. I love it. I think it is great. I think it really is Americana at its best. 
During good and prosperous times, we should not turn away and we should not create conditions that make it difficult, if not impossible, for them to serve the needs of our neighbors and our friends, and people in all of our communities. 
Mr. President, it is not good enough to say, `I am going to vote for a credit union bill,' and then attempt to fix a whole series of measures aimed at impeding the credit unions from doing their job. There are going to be some of my good friends and colleagues who are going to come here and say, `We want to make it possible for others in the financial services area to recognize that we love them and we care for them,' et cetera. 
There are going to be a number of amendments that are going to be put forth. Some of these amendments, and one in particular, one that would attempt to remove the Community Reinvestment Act from the obligation of community banks--if that is passed, that will spell a veto of this bill. 
I am not suggesting to you we shouldn't help community banks. I want to help them. Indeed, our President who presides today has come forth. I want to commend the Senator from Colorado for some very creative, long overdue actions to help community banks in the most positive way by seeing to it that they do not have unfair tax burdens placed upon them, by seeing that they have the opportunity to expand their board of directors or their shareholders, the number of shareholders, without falling into another taxable area. 
There are things we can do and should be doing. But we shouldn't be attempting to do them, in my opinion, on this bill because it clouds the issue of whether or not we are going to give credit unions the opportunity to continue to serve their people. 
Let me suggest this. Our Senate bill goes much further than the House bill to ensure the safety and the soundness of credit unions through tougher, more detailed provisions requiring a system of prompt, corrective action for federally insured credit unions. 
This is not a giveaway. This is not the same bill that came from the House. It is improved. It is tougher on them and fairer on them. We sat down and negotiated with them. We said to them that we are not going to place at risk the FDIC insurance for the American taxpayer. They agreed. 
The system is be patterned after the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. This is a different bill from the one that comes from the House. It is aimed at protecting our taxpayers. 
The Senate bill also includes for the first time capital requirements for all federally insured credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions. Together, these provisions represent the most significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness since 1970 when the National Credit Union insurance fund was created. 
We have included the enhanced safety and soundness provisions upon the recommendation of the Treasury Department following an extensive Treasury Department study placed in legislation by our colleague, Senator Bennett. These are basic, prudent approaches to successfully manage any financial institution that Congress has already applied to banks and thrifts. In the long run, it is the American taxpayer that we protect by assuring that credit unions reach and attain high levels of capital, or face restrictions with respect to their operations. 
Credit unions, no matter how small or how large, need a sufficient capital buffer to handle unexpected downturns in the economy and subsequent losses. The capital requirements in this bill will see to it that those goals are achieved. 
We all know how important prevention is, along with legislative oversight, when dealing with financial institutions. Credit unions are no different from other financial institutions when it comes to prevention and oversight. 
There are those who will say you are going in and giving to the masses. No. We responded to their legitimate concerns that they can continue business. But we have tougher end requirements as it relates to sound operation and oversight and the ability to close those down who may not be meeting their obligations. 
In 1991, the GAO issued an extensive study which detailed the recommendations for corporate credit union investments and capital ratios that were later adopted. These recommendations were also adopted by the NCUA. 
The failure of Cap Corp. in 1995 raised specific concerns about the interest rate risk that corporate credit unions were taking. Our committee held hearings in early 1995 and later reported out a bill, S. 883. In 1997, NCUA issued a comprehensive revision of the rules governing corporate credit unions to address concerns arising from the failure of Cap Corp. 
Mr. President, credit unions all over are now in solid shape, as concluded in the exhaustive study done by Treasury last year. The new safety and soundness provisions, as recommended by the Treasury Department, will further strengthen insured credit unions across the country and, in so doing, protect our taxpayers. 
Our legislation also goes much further than the House in placing for the first time significant restrictions on member business loans. We are going to hear something about that. We are going to hear that we should restrict loans that credit unions can make. While the House bill simply puts a freeze on current regulations and requires a study, our bill places statutory limits on the amount of total business loans available for credit unions. 
This is not a bill crafted to please all. This is a bill crafted to permit credit unions to do that which they do best--to make those loans, those personal loans to their members, and, yes, to meet the needs of the small businessmen. 
In the Senate bill, the total amount of outstanding member business loans of a federally insured credit union cannot exceed 12.25 percent of the assets of the credit union. Credit unions that become undercapitalized--that is, less than 6 percent of their net worth--are prohibited from making new commercial loans that would result in an increase in the total amount of member business loans outstanding. Credit unions that presently exceed the member business loan limits will be given 3 years in which to come into compliance. 
Mr. President, this is a pretty tough loan limitation, the first time. It is not in the House bill--never had any limitations on business loans. There are going to be some who genuinely feel that should be curtailed even further. I would suggest to go further would really do violence to the ability of almost 200 of the Nation's 1,500 credit unions that make these loans available today. It is unintended mischief that will take place if that legislation passes. I say `unintended,' Mr. President. Notwithstanding unintended, the consequences will not be fair and will be disruptive. 
These restrictions on business lending in our bill are real and they are meaningful, and together with the expanded safety and soundness provisions in title III of the bill, we will ensure that credit union business lending does not present any safety and soundness concerns. In a July 13 letter to the majority leader, Secretary Rubin has stated Treasury's position that the prompt corrective action in capital standard provisions in the bill represent an adequate response to any safety and soundness concerns about credit union business lending. 
Furthermore, I have a copy of the statement of the administration policy dated July 22, 1998, which states that there is no safety and soundness basis for additional business loan requirements.

Mr. DAMATO. We need to act expeditiously on this legislation. I am deeply grateful to the Senate majority leader for making this time available so that we can go forward. Make no mistake about it, without the ability to add new members and new groups, the credit union movement would be fatally injured. 
I am convinced that we are going to move in a prompt way and that the legislation will pass by an overwhelming margin. Why? Because it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to do for 73 million Americans who now belong to credit unions, for the 20 million Americans whose current credit union membership is threatened, and for the 675 million Americans and small businesses who may be shut out, prevented from joining a credit union in the future. I certainly urge my colleagues to support and expeditiously act on this important legislation. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I would be remiss if I did not thank my colleague, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, the distinguished senior Senator from Maryland, for his outstanding contribution and leadership in helping to craft this legislation and to bring it to this point in a totally bipartisan fashion. We would not be here positioned to go forth on this legislation were it not for his outstanding leadership and that of a dedicated bipartisan staff, might I add, on the minority side. They have done an absolutely fabulous job in bringing us to this point. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me just take a brief moment because I know the Senator from Missouri has been anxiously waiting to seek the floor. 
I thank my colleague from Colorado, a member of our Banking Committee, as well as the Presiding Officer, for their support not only in this endeavor as it relates to the credit unions but for our overall legislative efforts. Indeed, I believe that Senator Allard has offered in a most constructive way an opportunity to begin to give to the small business entrepreneur, and in this case the small community bank, an opportunity to create meaningful competition, to allow retained earnings to be held to avoid double taxation, and to make a very positive impact on financial modernization that will lead to greater competition and in the long run will expand the economy and the tax base for individual small banks, and as a result, benefit all of our citizens. This effort is not only a worthwhile endeavor, it is one that all of us should seek to support, Republicans and Democrats alike. 
Let me simply say this because I feel compelled to do so. I understand the frustrations of many of my colleagues as we debate the question of CRA and whether or not it should be a factor for small banks, whether it should be continued, or whether it should be modernized. Indeed, I think we should take a closer look at this issue, as Senator Allard has in terms of coming forth with his legislative proposal which addresses tax relief. 
The CRA amendment regarding small banks is a broad brush, shotgun approach for those who would support the effort of dealing with this issue in the context of a very important legislative matter. It beclouds the issue. Addressing this important matter of CRA for small banks now does not help in attempting to see to it that we remove barriers from honest competition, barriers that maybe should be removed and that we should address. But, I repeat, to bring it up in this form with the limited time that we have this Session will be disruptive to the overall effort. 
I ask all of my colleagues, my Republican colleagues in particular, and even those who have signed on and indicated support of the effort of the Senator from Alabama to help community banks, not to undertake it at this time. It actually distracts from the merits of their argument. It will prevent considering their concerns carefully and analyzing what can be done to ease these burdens, to assess if they really are burdensome and if so, in what way. So I am going to appeal to my colleagues--I appeal to them today; I will appeal to them on Monday--this is not the time to be going forward seeking relief that we will not have the opportunity to act on in any event. It will fracture our efforts on the credit union bill. It will at the least, the very least, bog down this effort. The House of Representatives will not accept the bill with this amendment. If they do accept it, then what will happen is that the bill will be a vetoed. Now what are we accomplishing? Why do we want to confuse whether or not we are really supporting credit unions with this attempt at dealing with another unrelated issue? That will only serve to hurt our efforts for credit unions. 
This Senator intends to support the motion of Senator Gramm of removing the CRA provisions from this credit union bill. But my gosh, if we are going to begin reaching far back through existing laws, without doing so in a meaningful way, then what I suggest what we are doing is purely mischief making. We want to be loved by all. We want to make everyone happy. I understand that. That is the nature of those in politics. But there comes a time when we have to take a stand and do what is right. Sometimes you can't have the adoration of all. Better to have the respect and to do what is right. 
I will be urging that of my colleagues, and particularly those who have concerns about the application of CRA on the community banks. Let's do what is right. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I think, as much as we will be returning on Monday to resume debate and consideration of the credit union legislation, which is so important, and which I believe will be adopted overwhelmingly, I urge any of my colleagues who might want to make statements that we will be available to receive those statements at this point. If not, it seems to me we will then be moving, at the request of the majority leader, to adjourn until Monday. 
So I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum and hope if there are any of my colleagues who would like to make their statements now, opening statements or observations, that they would do so within the next 5 to 10 minutes.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I must say that in the areas in which my ranking member, friend and colleague, Senator Sarbanes and I have worked on in the Banking Committee, we have shared rather similar positions on--well, just about 80 or 90 percent of the issues we have addressed, whether it be on housing issues or mass transportation issues or issues regarding financial services. 
Indeed, I almost reluctantly come to the conclusion that this is not the appropriate time to undertake expanding CRA activities by prescribing them for credit unions. And just as I have cautioned my colleagues and friends--most of them on the Republican side--that if we are to look at the benefits, and maybe some of the effects that are not beneficial which could be the unintended consequences of a well-intentioned law--and I have no doubt it is well-intentioned--it is my opinion, overall, that CRA has been beneficial in attempting to ensure that financial institutions that accept deposits from a particular area or community, direct some of those financial activities back into that community. 
Now, let us not kid ourselves. I think we are disingenuous if we would suggest that all institutions are sure to meet both a financial and moral commitment and balance both. Some of these financial institutions have to be conscious of their stockholders and conscious of doing business in our very competitive society. And I think that we would be less than candid if we were not to recognize that there have been institutions over the years that have directed their investment activities with almost a singular purpose--to bring to the bottom line the greatest profits that they can possibly derive, without attempting to help a community, to derive an investment strategy or portfolio that would only give them the highest possible return. 
I think it was as a result of looking at activities where communities and banks were gathering deposits from communities and giving little, if any, back and, indeed, engaged in the practice of redlining--and there have been studies, these practices are documented. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston conducted a study that documented redlining practices in Boston, Massachusetts. And that is unfortunate, it is an outrage. But those are the facts. 
Consequently, Congress came forth and passed legislation--and it is the law of the land--that directs credit allocation to these areas that heretofore were not receiving it, whether they be the rural areas or whether they be in the inner cities. But let us not kid ourselves. Redlining was taking place, and it is, again, disingenuous for any of our colleagues to suggest that it was not. 
Maybe we should provide an opportunity for some of the smaller institutions that have an exemplary record--and indeed I am very conscious of the statements made in the 1997 Federal Reserve report, that there were only nine--only nine out of the thousands of community banks that were cited for inadequate investment, not meeting the goals of CRA. That is a great, great record. Maybe we could find a solution where there is a less frequent accounting or reporting process that would ease the burden, particularly for institutions that have demonstrated that they do care, that they have a concern, and that they meet their social responsibility. That is why CRA came about--to see to it that it was not just to get the highest yield every time, because Congress said, `We insure these, and we think there should be some effort made at allocating credit, yes, in communities that might not otherwise be as attractive for investment purposes.' 
That is what we are talking about. That is how CRA came about. So while I am sympathetic to the unintended burdens that may have been created, I also am appreciative of the fact that there have been billions of dollars as a result of this program that have been invested in rural areas, in rural America, and in urban centers that may not have otherwise benefitted from investment. This practice has, in turn, created profits, jobs, opportunity and hope for Americans that otherwise wouldn't be. 
Having said that, I am arguing on one side why we should not at this time be looking to simply wipe out CRA legislation affecting community banks. I am willing to discuss this matter, willing to hold hearings and willing to go forward and examine, What alternative solutions can ease burdens that may exist? But by the same token, regarding CRA-like implications for credit unions, I just believe it is wrong. We are talking about groups of people, cooperatives, who come together by their very nature. 
When we look at this matter more closely--Monday, I intend to look at the profile of the credit union member. I have to tell you, they meet the description when we try to encourage making available moneys and resources and to see to it, whether it be the community banks or all the financial institutions, that they become involved. And that is why they have come together. Their very profile, absolutely in terms of demographics, in terms of per capita income, meets the needs that we have tried to establish overall through CRA. 
I believe it is absolutely counterproductive to say to the very people of these cooperatives--nonprofit institutions, have moneys that go right back into that institution; it is their capital, not the individual who earns more, or takes out more, or a stockholder--that we then place this requirement on them when it has never been demonstrated to be necessary. Indeed a letter from the NCUA attests to that fact. I will just read part of this letter. It was written to Phil Bechtel, chief counsel for the Senate Banking Committee, June 1, 1998, signed by Robert Loftus, director of Public Congressional Affairs. 
It says, `Our investigations have not produced any evidence'--any evidence--`that credit unions are guilty of redlining or other discriminatory practices.' 
Given that history, let us move forward--I support this legislation, but I believe that the Senator from Texas is right in moving to strike this provision. I also strongly believe that, to those of my colleagues who want to give regulatory relief to the small banks and community banks, as well intentioned as they are, their efforts will absolutely do nothing but delay, bring about more confusion, and the charges that in their attempt to do provide relief to small banks, what they are really doing is trying to defeat this legislation. I think whether it is an unintended consequence or not, that is exactly how it is going to be portrayed. And I will say on the floor to my colleagues: Recognize what you are doing, recognize that you want to be loved by all. 
I think that the point can be made. I think we can fight for regulatory relief. There are times and places to do it. But this is not the time nor the place. If this was the last boat going out of town, then fine, we would do it. I think there are a couple other areas where I could suggest that my colleagues address this issue of relief for small banks, if they really want to see this legislation enacted. And it would be appropriate to undertake that, but not here, and not on this credit union bill. 
I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here, and I know he wants to speak to this bill. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I support this important legislation to eliminate tariff duties on certain wool fabrics. Currently, there exists a disparity in the tariff schedule which forces companies like Hickey-Freeman, in Rochester, New York and Learbury in Syracuse, New York, who import very high quality wool fabric, to pay a tariff of 31.7 percent. 
These same finished suits imported from Canada come into the United States tariff free. If the suits are imported from Mexico, there is an 11 percent tariff and from other countries, the tariff rate is 20.2 percent. This inverted tariff schedule actually provides an incentive to import suits rather than produce them here in the United States with domestic labor and domestic wool. 
This straightforward, clear legislation would suspend through December 31, 2004 the duty on the finest wool fabrics (known specifically as Super 90s weight or higher grade wool). These higher quality fabrics are produced in very limited quantities in the United States, so this tariff reduction would have no negative impact on domestic producers. 
Clearly, if there were enough of this wool fabric produced domestically, there would be no need for this legislation since suitmakers would not need to import wool and pay the extortionately high rate of 31.7 percent. Indeed, if the U.S. suit manufacturing industry is allowed to compete fairly with imported suits, and not forced to reduce costs just to pay for inverted tariff rates, domestic wool use will actually increase with the additional suits that will be manufactured in the United States. 
Additionally, the provision would reduce the duty for slightly lower grade, fine wool fabric (Super 70s and 80s) to 20.2 percent--the same duty as on finished wool suits. 
Mr. President, under current law, if two fabric buyers, one American and the other Canadian, purchase fabric from a foreign country, say Italy, they each pay the exact same price. Yet when they bring the fabric back to their country to be made into suits that is where the problem occurs. 
The American is forced to pay a tariff of 31.7 percent on the imported fabric, which then must be absorbed into the cost of the suit, or eaten by the manufacturer. The Canadian buyer pays no tariff. Additionally, the Canadian suit maker can then export to the U.S., and because of the NAFTA agreement, they pay no tariff. As a result, Canadian shipments of men's suits into the United States has gone from 0 to 1.5 million in only ten years. 
Mr. President, I am extremely concerned with the current wool tariff because this inverted tariff policy has negatively impacted U.S. jobs. U.S. production has fallen by 40 percent and jobs by 50 percent. And, Mr. President, this additional tariff raises the costs for consumers as well. 
I am proud to join with Senators Moynihan and Specter in this important legislation, and look forward to its early passage and enactment into law.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, Senator Sarbanes, and others in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Nickles. This amendment would strike the increase for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan limits in high cost areas and double the guaranty fees charged by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). I strongly oppose this amendment which would unfairly deny homeownership opportunities for moderate-income families in high cost areas and could increase housing costs for all FHA and Veterans Affairs (VA) home loan borrowers. 
I commend Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, and the Appropriations Committee for including an increase in the FHA loan limits for both low-cost areas, including isolated rural areas, as well as for high cost areas, such as Long Island and New York City in my home state of New York. The Committee's inclusion of modest increases in the FHA loan-limits will create fairness by allowing Americans in high- and low-cost areas to also have the opportunities for homeownership which are provided by FHA to their fellow Americans. 
Mr. President, the FHA program is a true American success story, having provided an opportunity for homeownership to approximately 25 million families since its inception in 1934. It has served as the predominant player in the home mortgage market for low-income and minority borrowers, first-time home buyers and borrowers with high loan-to-value ratios. It operates in all regions, regardless of economic downturns. According to a 1996 Federal Reserve Board study, FHA bears about two-thirds of he aggregate credit risk for low-income and minority borrowers. 
FHA loans have made homeownership possible for many Americans who otherwise could not have qualified for mortgage credit. FHA generally differs from conventional lenders in the following ways: downpayments may be as low as 3 percent; closing costs may be financed; credit rating requirements are more flexible; monetary gifts may be used for downpayments; and a borrower may carry more debt. 
Mr. President, I acknowledge there are important questions that must be answered regarding FHA's current operations, including instances of foreclosures. The General Accounting Office and the HUD Inspector General have repeatedly expressed concerns regarding material weaknesses affecting the FHA program--such as staffing deficiencies, the lack of Year 2000 compliance, improper monitoring of the single-family property inventory, and insufficient early warning and loss preventions systems. 
HUD foreclosures have devastating effects on our families and our neighborhoods. Rundown properties left to stand vacant for months on end often become magnets for vandalism, crime and drug activity. These conditions decrease the marketability of the houses, increase HUD's holding costs, drive down the costs of surrounding homes, and in some cases threaten the health and safety of neighbors. 
HUD must do more to reduce default risks and mitigate losses. And if foreclosure prevention efforts fail, properties must be disposed of more quickly to protect our neighborhoods. 
The increases provided in this appropriations bill respond to inequities in home purchase prices that exist across our nation. Americans in high- and low-cost areas should not be denied the opportunity for homeownership simply because of the geographic regions in which they live. I strongly support Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski's initiative to right this wrong in high-cost urban and low-cost rural areas. The FAA loan-limit increase, for high-cost and low-cost areas, will allow more Americans equal access to median purchase homes with the needed help of FHA. FHA will still help to provide new and existing entry-level starter homes, not large or luxury homes. In fact, in the 32 high-cost areas across America where loan limits would be increased, the median price of a starter home is often twenty to thirty percent higher than the current maximum loan limit. In 1996, the average homeownership rate in these areas was approximately fifty eight percent, compared to a national rate of approximately sixty five percent. Clearly, the American Dream of homeownership is out of reach for too many hardworking moderate income families in these high cost areas. 
Mr. President, FHA's current loan limits do not adequately reflect the reality of housing prices in high cost areas. Portions of 43 metropolitan areas have median home prices at or above the current $170,362 high-cost limit. In the Dutchess County area, the median home sales price in 1997 was $175,000. In the Nassau-Suffolk area, the median home sales price was $195,000. And in New York City, the median home sales price was $208,000. 
Mr. President, 52.5 million people reside in high cost areas-comprising twenty one percent of the nation's population. It is inherently unfair that over 50 million Americans should not have the same opportunities through the FHA that other Americans have. 
American working families would benefit from the proposal, not the wealthy. The average FHA borrower has a family income of $40,800. According to HUD, the limit increases included in this bill would barely raise the average homeowner borrower income level. However, some borrowers would need an income of $70,000 to qualify for a $197,000 mortgage. In New York City or on Long Island, a family income of $70,000 is a typical two wage-earner family. These are middle class families--schoolteachers, policemen, and civil servants--raising children and struggling to pay their bills. In Nassau and Suffolk counties the median income of a family of four is $63,400. Wages are higher in Long Island because the cost of living is higher. And home purchase prices are higher--which is why this increased adjustment is necessary. The high cost limit increase would simply grant these areas parity--not an underserved advantage. 
I am very pleased that the increase in the base limit will rural Americans in low-cost counties where existing housing may be substandard, the opportunity to purchase new homes. New York also has many low-cost areas, such as Buffalo, Elmira, Glens Falls, Jamestown-Dunkirk, Syracuse and Utica-Rome, which would be helped by the low-cost increase. I urge my colleagues from the states without high-cost areas to also be sympathetic to Americans in high-cost cities and suburbs, where home prices are higher due to high land, material and labor costs.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my colleagues, Senator Kit Bond, the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Senator Connie Mack, the Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development. 
It is my understanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a series of regulations on June 30, 1998 dealing with a wide variety of HUD programs affecting millions of units of affordable housing. In each of these regulations, HUD has waived the sixty-day public comment period required under HUD's notice and comment rulemaking procedures. Instead, each of these regulations has included an expedited comment and review period. I would ask my colleagues if I have stated the facts accurately.

Mr. DAMATO. I thank my colleagues for their remarks and I join them in urging HUD to extend the time allotted for public review and comment of these three important and expansive HUD rules. HUD's notice and comment rulemaking procedures are designed to ensure an adequate period of time for public notice, review and comment. 
It is essential that HUD provide an adequate timeframe in which housing organizations, residents of assisted housing and local government entities have a chance to offer meaningful input in the development of final regulations. Given the important nature of these three rules and the significant impact which they will likely have on the families assisted by HUD's programs, I believe it is essential that the public be granted an additional amount of time in which to comment.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I was tremendously heartened by the vote today on an amendment which would have set back home ownership tremendously. Indeed, by a vote of 69 to 27, the Senate voted to table the amendment offered by Senator Nickles which would have limited FHA insurance to over 50 million Americans. 
Currently, there are 52.5 million Americans who live in high-cost areas where FHA simply does not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In high cost areas, such as Nassau County, New York the current FHA limit of $170,000 is insufficient because the median cost for a home was $195,000 in 1997. It is nearly impossible for many young families starting out to achieve the American Dream of homeownership. Let me be clear, we are not talking about wealthy families; we are talking about a two-wage-earner couple, just married, a schoolteacher and a police officer--struggling to accumulate the necessary funds for that first downpayment. 
In many high cost areas, FHA no longer covers the cost for entry-level, new starter homes. In Levittown, Long Island--which epitomized post-war expansion of homeownership for working, middle-class families, especially for GIs returning home from the war--that opportunity, unfortunately, is becoming more difficult today. Even in times where we say the economy is booming and a nationwide rise in homeownership, families in high cost areas are too often being left behind. Indeed, in many of these high cost areas, the homeownership rate is lagging far behind the nationwide average. Young families starting out on their own have to come up with $25,000 for a downpayment--which is very, very difficult to achieve, especially in an area where the cost of living places such a tremendous strain on the family budget. We are not talking about people of affluence. Nor are we talking about magnificent estates or mansions, but simply average median-cost homes. 
Indeed, in Long Island, where homeownership has been such a key ingredient to permitting people to work and live as part of a community, home ownership is becoming more difficult for these working, middle-class families. It is simply beyond their reach. Thankfully, today we have helped to bring relief to families in high cost areas by raising the FHA limit. In Long Island, the area that I grew up in and live in, where there are nearly 3 million people, we will now be providing greater opportunities for young middle class families to own their own home. The current FHA limit, which is set at $170,000, is simply too low in an area where there are relatively very few homes that can be purchased in all of the island for $170,000 or less. By raising the limit up to $197,000, FHA will better reflect the reality of the marketplace where the median home prices in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were $195,000 in 1997. We will now be providing that opportunity to thousands of young families who will be looking to purchase that first home in Long Island. 
Nationwide, about 21 percent of the Nation's population lives in high-income areas. Again, this FHA increase in not for the benefit of the affluent--they do not need FHA insurance and will continue to be served by the private market. Indeed, they buy homes that cost much more than $197,000. 
What we have done is, I believe, struck a blow for home ownership, for young families who want to get an opportunity, from one length of the country to another. 
The mayor of Albany, Mayor Gerald Jennings, he called me yesterday. He was concerned because of the outlying communities in the Albany area. The county executive from Nassau, Tom Gulotta, called me because his housing experts advised him that too many young families are being denied the opportunity to purchase a home. They need to be able to get FHA insurance for young families who are starting out on their own. 
I commend the Senate for overwhelmingly supporting this provision by a vote of 69-27 to raise the FHA limits in high cost areas. I believe we achieved a big victory for home ownership throughout this country today. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, for too long now, the world has been watching a terrible carnage take place with the changing of the former Yugoslavia, with the various factions fighting for autonomy, with the deterioration of respect for human life being so obvious, that we almost take it as a matter of fact when people are massacred, and we hear that the atrocities reach incredible levels. 
It becomes commonplace to hear of tens of thousands of people who can no longer live in their homes. Indeed, estimates are that 3 million people have been forced to move. They call it `ethnic cleansing.' Despite the best attempts by the United States and some of our allies, we have been unable to bring about some resolve. Tens of thousands of U.S. and NATO troops are now positioned in Bosnia to attempt to keep the conflict from again affecting the lives of the innocent--women and children, people who are held hostage, people who are abducted, women who are raped, young men who are killed because of their ethnic background. It is incredible. Muslims are killed because they are Muslims. Croats are killed because they are Croats. Serbs are killed because they are Serbs. The madness that exists in this day and age is incomprehensible. 
Madam President, the situation is not getting better. The situation is deteriorating. And behind it all, the motivator, the prime mover in all of this, is one man. That doesn't mean that there aren't others who are responsible on all of the sides for having had their people undertake horrific acts against humanity. But there is one person--a hard-core Communist dictator who has been able to keep power by way of appealing to the worst prejudices of people--by the name of Slobodan Milosevic. He would like to think of himself as a duly-elected President. He is the last surviving Communist leader still in power from before the wall fell. Make no mistake about it, although he may call himself a President, but he is a criminal, he is a thug, and he has been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people, including his own people. This is the man, the thug, the killer. 
Indeed, the resolution that I, Senator Lieberman, and a number of our colleagues, including the present Presiding Officer, have worked on is one that deals with this thug. It is one that will call for the United States and others to gather the factual information necessary to pursue a trial in the international courts that have been established just for that purpose. Indeed, the United Nations Security Council, in 1993, created the International Criminal Tribunal with the former Yugoslavia located in the Hague. The tribunal has already publicly indicted 60 people for war crimes or crimes against humanity. It is horrific. 
Even at this time, today, in the New York Times, we read an account of what is taking place.

Mr. DAMATO. Let me read a little excerpt: 
Serbian forces have been turning increasingly to the abduction and execution of small groups of civilians in their fight against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, according to human rights officials and witnesses. 
The article goes on to interview a man by the name of Ndue Biblekaj. Biblekaj was a member of the police force for 8 years, and he eventually left in disgust after having witnessed the kinds of things that he describes. He says he has witnessed the abductions and executions by members of the Serbian `black hat' unit, which was employed in Bosnia to kill Muslims and Croats and expel them from their homes. 
Imagine, they have an official unit, and their job is to get rid of--and that is the ethnic cleansing--anyone who is different, like the Muslims and Croats. He said, `I saw black hat units line up 13 civilians and shoot them. They stripped the bodies of their clothes, slashed the arms and legs with their knives and dug out their eyes. 
`I will never forget this sight,' he said. `There were other executions that included women, children and the elderly. You could see the bodies, including one group of 15 people, lined up by the side of road.' 
Biblekaj has deserted the police to join the rebel movement. He changed sides after the attack on Decani, because, he said, he was appalled by the killing there. 
That is just one man who was so repulsed at what he saw that he had to do something. He joined the rebel movement. 
This is a killing field once again. This is a killing field that unfortunately has been directed by Milosevic to empower himself. That is why this resolution, which is bipartisan and has the support of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, and the ranking member, Senator Biden, and people from both sides of the aisle, is so important. It is a resolution that will send a clear and convincing signal to the entire world that the United States is sick and tired of the way the world treats war criminals and that the world community can no longer sit by idly while the Milosevic killing machine continues. Yes. Even this day as we are here that killing machine continues. And so tens of thousands of people are on the move, fleeing their homes, and fleeing the villages where they grew up and their forefathers--fleeing because of their ethnic background, and the military forces who are bound to destroy them. 
Madam President, I want to commend all of my colleagues who have worked, along with Senator Lieberman and I, in bringing this resolution forward, because the United States should be publicly declaring that there is no reason to continue this without seeking the collection of evidence and making it high priority--evidence that the United States already possesses--to make this evidence available to the tribunal, to that court, as soon as possible. The United States has the ability to do this, and we should discuss with our allies and other States the gathering of this evidence so that Mr. Milosevic can be indicted. And I am certain, given the numerous accounts by historical experts--one of the leading accounts on this is entitled, `War Crimes and the Issues of Responsibility,' which was prepared by Norman Cigar and Paul Williams. It is an outstanding study of what is taking place, and the inescapable conclusion that Milosevic can and should be tried as a war criminal.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I believe we are about to take historic action that is so important, because, to date, what we have been doing is pleading, negotiating, hoping while the world burns in front of us. When I say `the world,' I am talking of technically the people in this war-torn area of Kosovo. 
It is incredible that 90 percent of the population there are ethnic Albanians under withering attack. In today's New York Times, it graphically speaks about it on the front page. 
As a witness to this, a former paramilitary, former police officer in the Serbian police, said he can no longer stay there and work there as he watched innocent women and children being raped, killed, tortured and savaged--3 million people on the move, ethnic cleansing, moving them out of their homes, moving them out of their communities all because of one thing--all because of their ethnicity. 
What we do today is the least we should be doing; and that is calling for the United States to, yes, utilize the provisions that the United Nations set up in terms of Security Council Resolution 827 creating the International Criminal Tribunal. 
This man can and should be charged as the war crime criminal that he is. The documentation has already been chronicled in one of the best reports, which I have submitted to this body. The conclusions are inescapable. It is called `War Crimes and the Issue of Responsibility,' prepared by Norman Cigar and Paul Williams. It documents the systematic slaughter and use of paramilitary groups against innocent civilians. There is no doubt that not only did he know about that but that he continues to perpetuate this kind of conduct. 
To summarize briefly what Resolution 105 does, it says that we, the United States, should publicly declare its considered reasons to believe that Milosevic has committed war crimes; that we make the checks of information that can be supplied to the Tribunal as evidence to support an indictment and trial of Milosevic for war crimes against humanity and genocide; that we should undertake it as a high priority; all of the information that we collect should be provided to the Tribunal as soon as possible; and, thereafter, that we coordinate our activities with our allies, members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and others interested in a matter of discussion of what we can and should be doing to apprehend this war criminal and others. 
Yes. Mr. President, the time has come to gather the evidence and to submit it to the Tribunal, and to see to it that this man is branded as the war criminal that he is instead of us all sitting back silently as innocent lives continue to be taken. 
Mr. President, I thank all of the Members of the U.S. Senate for the relatively short period of time Senator Lieberman and I began this effort in terms of gathering cosponsors and support several days ago. 
It makes me proud to be a Member of this body, for people to come together in this way to see, yes, the indictment of this war criminal. And he is one of the most evil men of our period of time. Make no mistake about it.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues in the Senate and the House for passing the Senate/House agreement on S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998. This legislation, which I introduced last year, will put an end to forced payments by thousands of middle-class homeowners for unnecessary private mortgage insurance. These unnecessary premiums--which in some cases amount to over $1,000 per year--benefitted no one, other than the PMI companies that raked-in risk-free money. This legislation will make it thousands of dollars cheaper for struggling middle-class home buyers--as well as co-op and condominium buyers--to share in the American dream of home ownership without limiting this opportunity for people who do need PMI coverage. 
Mr. President, the House passed this legislation late last night, so this bill will be sent to the White House for the President's signature. Today, requiring unnecessary PMI is unethical--when the President signs S. 318 into law, this fleecing of homeowners will become illegal. 
Mr. President, let me begin by acknowledging the important and beneficial role PMI plays in our mortgage markets. Traditionally, lenders have required 20% down for home mortgage loans. PMI was developed to allow home buyers purchase with less than 20% down. PMI is typically required when a home buyer cannot make the standard 20% down payment. In many areas, such as my home region of Long Island, housing prices are so high that many middle class home buyers, particularly first-time buyers, can't come up with a 20% down payment. The problem faced by these home buyers arises because while PMI benefits one party, the lender, it is paid for by the home owner. As a result, the lenders and servicers have no vested interest in pursuing cancellation, and the homeowner who was paying for the PMI could not, or did not know, that the coverage could be canceled. 
By passing this legislation, Congress is helping to make the American dream of home ownership more affordable for many home buyers--particularly struggling working families and people in areas with high housing costs--who needed PMI because they don't have a lot of cash on hand for a down payment. 
Some industry proponents have questioned whether this is a problem. Mr. President, the numbers speak for themselves. Every year, approximately 1 million mortgage loans are made with PMI coverage. 
In hearings in front of the Senate Banking Committee, even the private mortgage insurance industry was forced to admit that at least 250,000 homeowners have at least 20% equity in their homes and are still paying for unnecessary insurance. PMI premiums vary from $20 to $100 or more monthly. This means that working families are losing anywhere from $240 to $1200 or more per year in unnecessary payments. At $100 per month, the savings for 250,000 homeowners would be $300 million yearly. 
And these are just low-ball estimates of the extent of this problem--a 1997 analysis of a 20,000 loan portfolio indicated that 1 out of 5 homeowners were still paying for PMI, despite the fact that they had accumulated equity in excess of 20 percent.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend Senator Kit Bond, the distinguished Chairman of the Veterans Affairs and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Appropriations Subcommittee. I applaud the strong efforts of the Chairman in protecting funding for housing programs for senior citizens. I am pleased to support the funding provided by this bill for elderly housing. 
I was pleased to cosponsor Senator Bond's amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution earlier this year, expressing the Sense of the Senate that funding for the HUD Section 202 Elderly Housing program should be protected. The amendment, which passed the Senate by a vote of 97-2 on April 2, 1998, expressed a policy that was not only met but exceeded by this bill. Specifically, I fully support this bill's inclusion of $676 million for the Section 202 program in Fiscal Year 1999--a $31 million increase from the Fiscal Year 1998 funding level. 
The HUD Section 202 program is a critical component of our federal housing strategy. The program provides funding for the development of new affordable housing opportunities and services for seniors. This combination of affordable housing with services helps to promote and maintain the independence and dignity of our senior citizens. This critical program helps to protect seniors' quality of life by offering them an opportunity to remain active and respected members of the community. 
I was dismayed earlier this year by the Administration's proposal to reduce funding for this important program by over 83 percent, to a level of $109 million. This proposal to cut housing for the elderly was unacceptable. The funding increase provided by this bill sends a strong signal to the Administration that future proposals to cut the program will be met by fierce opposition by the Senate. 
Mr. President, I would also like to applaud Chairman Bond's inclusion of a requirement for HUD to conduct a formal study assessing the housing needs of elderly Americans. This much-needed study will examine the unmet housing needs of the elderly and assess the physical condition of the existing stock of affordable housing for the elderly. 
In connection with this study, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate an important resource for elderly housing in my home state of New York. The Council of Senior Centers and Services of New York City (Council) can provide invaluable input to HUD during the development of this study. The Council represents 265 senior service organizations--ranging from individual community centers to large, multiservice, city-wide organizations. 
I would ask the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee if it is his intent that HUD should develop the required study with the input and assistance of local senior housing providers and nonprofit organizations such as the Council of Senior Centers and Services?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator Moynihan, in introducing this bill that will designate that the U.S. Post Office located at 297 Larkfield Road in East Northport, New York, as the `Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building.' 
The designation will be a tribute to the life and legacy of a strong and able local and federal representative and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. In doing so, we join the entire New York delegation in supporting this bill. 
The designation will be a tribute to the life and legacy of a strong and able local and federal representative and I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. In doing so, we join the entire New York delegation in supporting this bill. 
Anthony Ambro was a full fledge New Yorker. He had his own ideas and his own means of accomplishing his goals--and those goals greatly assisted his constituency. He was a great man from a different political persuasion. But one thing is certain, he put people ahead of politics. 
Born in Brooklyn, he attended New York University where he received his Bachelor's degree. He served in the United States Army, Military Police before he began his career in public service. He was budget officer, purchasing and personnel director for the Town of Huntington, served on Suffolk County Board of Supervisors and was elected to four terms as Supervisor of the Town of Huntington. In addition, he was president of the freeholders of the Town of Huntington and co-founder of the New York State Coalition of Suburban Towns. 
To reward him for the tremendous accomplishments for the people of Suffolk County, he was elected to the House of Representatives beginning in 1975, for three terms. Beginning in 1981, he operated a consulting business bringing his own brand of humor and sagacity to bear on behalf of hundreds of New Yorkers as they struggled to make sense of Washington's labyrinth. 
During his tenure he served as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the Environment, working on environmental issues, including the prohibiting the dumping of dredged material in Long Island Sound. As a local official, he supported housing projects for the elderly. He was a free-thinking man whose primary purpose was to represent the needs of his constituency and whose tenacity was driven by his beliefs. 
I counted him as a friend and advisor who made many a lunch-time meal at the Monocle a pleasure as well as an education. 
Anthony Ambro passed away in March, 1993 from diabetes complications. I am sure he is missed terribly by his wife Antoinette Salatto Ambro, and his children, step children and grandchildren. His qualities endeared him to the people of New York and I hope these sentiments will be reflected in the passage of this measure. I thank the senior Senator from New York and urge its enactment.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments regarding the passage of H.R. 3156 late yesterday. This bill authorizes the President to present, on behalf of Congress, the Congressional Gold Medal to Nelson Mandela. I am very pleased that the Senate has acted swiftly to pass this legislation. 
The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor that the United States Congress may bestow on a civilian. This prestigious award has been bestowed on a variety of people whose leadership and lives have left an indelible impression on our great nation. President Mandela is without a doubt, one of those persons who has earned our recognition through his leadership in the quest for freedom and equality. 
His ongoing struggle for such noble causes has carried the people of South Africa into a new era. And, his compassion for the downtrodden has been felt around the world uplifting all people suffering from oppression. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes for his efforts in seeing this legislation through the Senate in an expedited manner. I would also like to thank Congressman Houghton for first introducing this bill, H.R. 3156, in the House and for all of his hard work and leadership.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment relating to rural housing programs of the Department of Agriculture. I express my sincere appreciation to Chairman Cochran and Ranking Minority Member Bumpers for their consideration of the amendment which I offer with Senator Paul Sarbanes, Ranking Minority Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. I commend them for their steadfast commitment to providing affordable housing for rural Americans. 
The Department of Agriculture operates a number of successful housing programs under the auspices of its Rural Housing Service (RHS). Rural housing programs, while a function of the Department of Agriculture, are under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. As Chairman of the Banking Committee, I respectfully request the adoption of this amendment. 
This amendment will permit vital housing programs to continue in an uninterrupted fashion. It includes one-year extensions of existing housing programs. Specifically, the RHS Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, the RHS Section 538 Rural Rental Housing Loan Guarantee Program, and the RHS Underserved Areas Program would be extended until September 30, 1999. These short-term extensions are necessary to ensure that needy Americans continue to be served. 
There is a critical need for affordable housing in rural America. According to the 1990 census, over 2.7 million rural Americans live in substandard housing. In my home State of New York, 76 percent of renters are paying 30 percent or more of their income for housing. Approximately 60 percent of New York renters pay over 50 percent of their income for rent. 
The Rural Housing Service Section 515 and Section 538 programs represent a significant portion of the limited resources available to respond to this serious unmet housing need. Since its inception in 1962, the Section 515 rental loan program has financed the development of over 450,000 units of affordable housing in over 18,000 apartment projects. The program assists elderly, disabled and low-income rural families with an average income of $7,200. The Section 538 program is a relatively new loan guarantee program which has proven to have widespread national appeal. With a subsidy rate of approximately 3 cents per dollar, it is an example of cost-efficient leveraging of public resources. 
I thank the Appropriations Committee for its recognition of the great need for these essential rural housing programs. I support immediate adoption of this amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to encourage Senate passage of H.R. 3156, a bill to authorize the President to present Nelson Mandela with the Congressional gold medal. President Mandela is a courageous world leader who has championed rights for freedom and equality for decades. 
Nelson Mandela was born in South Africa in 1918, the son of a Tembu tribal chief. His tribal name, Rolihlahla, means, `one who brings trouble upon himself.' The name seems to have led the young Mandela into a life of challenge, from the time he chose to enroll in college in pursuit of a law degree over his right to become tribal chiefdom, to his more than 25 years spent incarcerated as a political prisoner in his native South Africa. Nelson Mandela continually led the cause for liberation of his people. 
Mr. President, who could forget the image as multitudes of South Africans stood in long lines on April 27, 1994 to cast their first vote in the country's first-ever democratic elections. In his inaugural address, President Mandala presented himself as the right man to lead all people of South Africa into a time of healing for peace, justice, and democracy. His blueprint for South Africa is one for all citizens of that country regardless of race, religious affiliation or gender, working together to build a nation of prosperity. 
Nelson Mandela is known throughout the world for his long struggle in the fight against apartheid and has received a number of prestigious humanitarian awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. It is only fitting that this country recognize Nelson Mandela's life of dedication and sacrifice and his victory over racial inequality not only for South Africa, but for all peoples everywhere.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank my colleague, who has been waiting so patiently, for giving me the opportunity of sharing some thoughts with respect to the IRS reform package. I assure you I will keep my remarks to a minimum. 
But I would like to congratulate the manager of the bill, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, and the ranking member, my friend, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan. They have done an outstanding job. I would like to commend Senator Bob Kerrey for his work. His work truly has helped bring together the Senate and the Finance Committee in a way in which we can pass this legislation that will be helping millions of taxpayers and change, I think, the culture--the culture--in which the IRS has been operating. 
Indeed, the litany of witnesses and stories--anecdotal and otherwise--that demonstrated that there seemed to be a pattern that none of us could be proud of--the abuse of the little guy, not the big corporate giant, but the small business entrepreneur, the average-day citizen who lived in fear and, indeed, tyranny, and in some cases was rampant tyranny. And in no case was it worse than as it related to the innocent spouse. And every year approximately 50,000 cases were opened. And the revenuer was after a spouse who had little, if anything, to do with not paying their fair share of taxes--innocent of the fact--and in 90 percent of the cases they were women. They signed a joint return, and in some cases didn't even sign a return. We had some cases where their signature was forged, but we were so desperate for money, they were hunted down. Indeed, some had to give up their jobs and some had to live in fear, and some even left their spouses, their new spouses because they were afraid that the new spouse and his family would have the revenue agent after them. Horrendous. Incredible. 
I take this opportunity to salute a courageous person who came and testified before our committee, a citizen of New York, Beth Cockrell, who epitomized this tragedy and whose case went all the way up to the Supreme Court. And because of the manner in which the law was written, why, the court ruled against her. But nonetheless--nonetheless--she is a person who was abused by the revenue code and the agents who pursued her. 
Indeed, now they will be free, hundreds and hundreds of thousands--mostly women--who have lived for years with open cases against them, who had accumulations of interest and penalties, in some cases that go into the hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars, 
and they can hopefully now begin to resume a more normal life and clear away that pattern of abuse with which they have had to live. Hundreds of thousands will be free. And, yes, tens of thousands on a regular basis no longer will have to face this because they were married, and someone--their mate--did not pay his or her proper taxes, they were then held responsible. They would be totally innocent and unaware of this fact. 
I have heard colleagues speak to many issues in terms of what this bill does. I think it is important so the culture, hopefully, will be changed. 
I think one of the most significant provisions, one that I was proud to author along with Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Moynihan, the Innocent Spouse Relief Act of 1998, a bill that would give protection to innocent spouses, and is supported by all of our colleagues, will now be the law of the land, and those who are innocent will no longer have to live in fear for the actions of someone else. 
I thank my colleague for giving me this opportunity, Senator McCain of Arizona, to make these remarks. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, today I introduce legislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Murkowski, to correct an inequity in the Tax Code that deprives working people of hard earned pension benefits. The problem is section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, which sets compensation based limits and a dollar limit on pension plans. In effect, these section 415 limits discourage retirement savings. 
Workers are being denied the full benefits that they have earned through many years of labor and on which they and their spouses have counted in planning their retirement. We can all appreciate the frustration and anger of workers who are told, upon applying for their pension, that the federal government won't let their pension plan pay them the full amount of the benefits that they earned under the rules of their plan. For some workers, this benefit cutback means that they will not be able to retire when they wanted or needed to. For other workers, it means retirement with less income to live on, and in some cases, retirement without health care coverage and other necessities of life. 
The bill that Senator Murkowski and I are introducing today will give these workers relief from the most confiscatory provisions of section 415 and enable them to receive the full measure of their retirement savings, consistent with the policy goals of the National Summit on Retirement Savings recently sponsored by the President and the Congress. 
Mr. President, Congress has recognized and corrected the adverse effects of section 415 on government employee pension plans. In fact, as part of the Small Business Jobs Protection Act of 1996 and the Tax Relief Act of 1997, we exempted government employee pension plans from the compensation-based limit, from certain early retirement limits, and from other provisions of section 415. Relief measures for workers covered by multiemployer plans have been passed three times by the Senate, most recently in the Senate version of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Unfortunately, those changes were not maintained in the Senate/House Conference Report. 
Section 415 was enacted more than two decades ago when the pension world was quite different than today. The section 415 limits were designed to contain the tax-sheltered pensions that could be received by highly paid executives and professionals. The passage of time and Congressional action has stood this original design on its head. Today, the limits are forcing cutbacks in the pensions of rank-and-file workers. Executives and professionals are now able to receive pensions far in excess of the section 415 limits by establishing non-qualified supplemental retirement programs. 
Generally, section 415 limits the benefits payable to a worker by defined benefit pension plans to the lesser of (1) the worker's average annual compensation for the three consecutive years when his compensation was the highest (the compensation-based limit); and (2) a dollar limit that is sharply reduced if a worker retires before the Social Security normal retirement age of 65 or 66. 
The compensation-based limit assumes that the pension earned under a plan is linked to each worker's salary, as is typical in corporate pension plans (e.g., a percentage of the worker's final year's salary for each year of employment). That assumption is wrong as applied to multiemployer pension plans. Multiemployer plans, which cover more than ten million individuals, have long based their benefits on the collectively bargained contribution rates and years of covered employment with one or more of the multiple employers which contribute to the plan. In other words, benefits earned under a multiemployer plan generally have no relationship to the wages received by a worker from the contributing employers. The same benefit level is paid to all workers with the same contribution and covered employment records regardless of their individual wage histories. 
A second assumption underlying the compensation based limit is that workers' salaries increase steadily over the course of their careers so that the three highest salary years will be the last three consecutive years. While this salary history may be the norm in the corporate world, it is unusual in the multiemployer plan world. In multiemployer plan industries like building and construction, a worker's wage earnings typically fluctuate from year-to-year according to several variables including the availability of covered work and whether the worker is unable to work due to illness or disability. An individual worker's wage history may include many dramatic ups-and-downs. Because of these fluctuations, the three highest years of compensation for many multiemployer plan participants are not consecutive. Consequently, the section 415 compensation-based limit for these workers is artificially low; lower than it should be if they were covered by corporate plans. 
The dollar limit under section 415 is forcing severe cutbacks in the earned pensions of workers who retire under multiemployer pension plans before they reach age 65. For example, construction work is physically hard, and is often performed under harsh climatic conditions. Workers are worn down sooner than those in most other industries. Often, early retirement is a must. Multiemployer pension plans accommodate these needs of their covered worker by providing for early retirement, disability, and service pensions that provide a subsidized, partial or full pension benefit. 
As it stands now, section 415 is forcing cutbacks in these pensions because the dollar limit is severely reduced for each year you are under the normal Social Security retirement age. For a worker who retires at age 50, the dollar limit restricts their pension at about $40,000 per year. 
This reduced limit applies regardless of the circumstances under which the worker retires and regardless of his plan's rules regarding retirement age. A multiemployer plan participant who becomes disabled and is forced into early retirement is nonetheless subject to the reduced limit. In addition, a construction worker who, after 30 years of demanding labor, has well-earned a 30-and-out service pension at age 50, is nonetheless subject to the reduced limit. 
Our bill will ease this early retirement benefit cutback by extending to workers covered by multiemployer plans some of the more favorable early retirement rules that now apply to government employee pension plans and other retirement plans. These rules still provide for a reduced dollar limit for retirements earlier than age 62, but the reduction is less severe than under the current rules that apply to multiemployer plans. 
Mr. President, I am particularly concerned that early retirees who suffer pension benefit cutbacks will not be able to afford the health care coverage that they need. Workers who retire before they become eligible for Medicare are typically required to pay all or a substantial part of the cost of their health insurance. Section 415 pension cutbacks deprive workers of income they need to bear these health care costs. This is contrary to the sound public policy of encouraging workers and retirees to responsibly provide for their health care. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to cosponsor this important and necessary legislation.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I submit a resolution that calls for President Slobodan Milosevic of the rump Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to be indicted publicly by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (the War Crimes Tribunal), under its jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia on or after January 1, 1991. This step is long overdue. 
As early as December 1992, then-Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger publicly identified Milosevic as one of several individuals who could and should be held personally accountable for war crimes. I am confident that Secretary Eagleburger, in making this serious charge, was fully informed of the underlying facts that would form the basis of a prima facie case against Milosevic and which could be used to support his indictment. 
Still, there are some who have questioned whether a case against Milosevic can really be established. This issue was addressed in testimony before the Helsinki Commission in 1995 by Cherrif M. Bassiouni, who headed the U.N.'s Commission of Experts, the body first tasked with examining war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. Professor Bassiouni's work set the stage for the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. 
Professor Bassiouni's Commission had exhumed numerous mass grave sites, interviewed thousands of victims of rape and torture, and examined overwhelming quantities of other evidentiary materials. Based on this far-reaching study of the first two years of the Yugoslav conflict, Professor Bassiouni stated: 
At first, many thought that this was a sort of haphazard type of situation. We subsequently found that this was not haphazard, particularly in Bosnia, as you know, but also throughout most of the territory of the former Yugoslavia . . . there is no doubt that, in a large territorial expanse, over a significant period of time, the same patterns of behavior occurred, and the same administrative organization characterized the acts of ethnic cleansing--who did it, and how it was done . . . Particularly interesting is the way ethnic cleansing was done. It was done with plausible deniability in mind. 
When Professor Bassiouni was explicitly questioned about the possibility of indicting Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic--Karadzic was also named by Eagleburger and has since been publicly indicted, not once but twice--Professor Bassiouni said `It is unlikely that a number of similar incidents occurring over long periods of time, which were so well-publicized, could not have been known to the senior political leadership as well.' Since then, the evidence against Milosevic has only mounted, particularly as cases have proceeded before the Tribunal in The Hague. 
In spite of the overwhelming evidence of war crimes in this conflict and the clear command responsibility of Milosvic for his agents, no public indictment against him has yet been issued. In fact, it has been suggested by some that Milosevic has been granted de facto immunity based on a misguided belief that he is necessary for the implementation of the Dayton Accords. Nothing could be further than the truth. 
Under Milosevic's leadership, the situation in Kosovo has deteriorated dramatically, demonstrating the same fact pattern that we have already seen in Bosnia: systematic attacks against civilians, reported that rape is once again being used as a form of warfare, and mass displacement of men, women and children. Milosevic is not part of the solution, he is part of the problem. Significantly, the War Crimes Tribunal has made it clear that, under its statute, it also has responsibility for the war crimes in Kosovo. 
Mr. President, we know that the War Crimes Tribunal has issued an unknown number of sealed indictments; in a few instances, the existence of these indictments have become public when the indictee has been arrested. Certainly, there are cases where it may facilitate the arrest of an individual if his indictment remains sealed. In the case of Milosevic, however, I can see no such benefits. Indeed, the failure to indict him publicly may have emboldened him in Kosovo. 
The time has come to indict Slobodan Milosevic for the atrocities that have been committed--and continue to be committed in Kosovo--under his leadership as head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and to issue that indictment publicly. 
Accordingly, the resolution I am submitting today calls on the United States to collect and supply to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, on a priority basis, evidence to support an indictment and trial of Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide; calls on the United States to provide a fair share of any additional financial or personnel resources that may be required by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands, in order to enable the Tribunal to adequately address preparation for, indictment of, prosecution of, and adjudication of allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity posed against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and any other person arising from the conflict in the Former Yugoslavia, including in Kosovo; calls on the United States to engage with our NATO allies and others in a discussion of measures to be taken to apprehend indicated war criminals and persons indicated for crimes against humanity with the objective of concluding a plan of action that will result in these indictees' prompt delivery into the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands; calls on the United States to urge the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands, to promptly review all information relating to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's possible criminal culpability for conceiving, directing, and sustaining a variety of actions in the Former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, that have had the effect of genocide, of other crimes against humanity, or of war crimes, with a view toward prompt issuance of a public indictment of Milosevic; and calls upon the United States to adopt a policy of having no dealings with Milosevic at any level in any context other than as a defendant before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, the Netherlands and to make every effort to support his immediate apprehension. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this sense of the Senate resolution, to demonstrate once again that we are not blind to the suffering that Milosevic continues to inflict on innocent people in the Balkans, for no reason other than to secure his own political power. By supporting and seeking prompt enactment of this resolution, we will show that Milosevic cannot act with impunity, that the world will hold him accountable, and that the United States is prepared to take a leadership role in obtaining justice for those killed, maimed, or injured as this man pursues his political ambitions.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Education Savings and School Excellency Act that is embodied in the conference report which is before the Senate today. I take the opportunity to congratulate and commend Senator Coverdell for his leadership and, indeed, a bipartisan leadership of Democrats and Republicans attempting to deal with the most important area that we face as a Nation, and that is improving the educational opportunities for our children. That is critical. This bill makes a great contribution to education in a number of areas. 
First, it gets parents more involved in educational decisions by increasing the annual contribution limits into a child's education savings account. I can't think of anything better. There are some people who don't want to do that. I don't know why. Why wouldn't you want to give people of modest means the ability to provide for the educational choice that they decide is best for their child? 
It increases those accounts from $500 to $2,000, and the bill allows a parent or a grandparent to really make an impact on a child's education. More parental involvement is an absolute critical piece of the educational puzzle. We must do everything we can to give parents more power in education, and that is what this bill does, because when parents have input into educational decisions, the children are winners. It seems all too often that we are worried about everybody but the children. That is what it comes down to. This bill helps parents and children. 
In addition to more parental involvement, another critical education reform relates to teachers. We simply must make sure that all teachers are competent in the subjects they teach. Most teachers are, and, indeed, we have dedicated, great teachers who make magic in the classroom. That is why there are particular important provisions in this bill that give to States and will give to local school districts the ability to reward the great and the outstanding educators in the classroom by making merit pay available. 
Why not give to the best and the brightest? And why not allow local school districts, working with their teachers, working with their local school boards the opportunity to design programs to do exactly that? Give the best and the brightest 
the compensation they are entitled to; reward them with merit pay. 
Secondarily, why shouldn't we see to it that every teacher who teaches our children is competent and proficient in the subject matters that they are teaching? We can't pay the great teachers enough, but we should attempt to find a system that does reward them. In addition to that, outstanding performances should be recognized. 
I am pleased to see that the conference included the merit amendment that Senator Mack and I offered. Indeed, one of our colleagues spoke to it just recently and indicated, wouldn't it be terrible if local school districts could actually draw revenues from other areas for this purpose. I think it is great. Why shouldn't they be able to make that decision? Why shouldn't they set up a system that rewards the competent teachers? Why shouldn't they set up a system where there is regular testing every 3 to 5 years to ascertain who is the best and who is the brightest and who is doing the work for our children? 
When we look at reforming our public schools, one thing must always be kept foremost in our efforts: We must put our children first. Our children are the best and the brightest, and they are our most precious resource. A fight to reform our education system is a fight for America's future. 
Our children are depending on us, and it is clear that parental involvement, merit pay, teacher competency testing are necessary if we are going to give the children the education they need. The time for talk is over; the time for action is now. 
Again, I commend Senator Coverdell for his outstanding leadership and his dedication to this process, because that is what this bill begins. It is not going to solve all the problems, but it really begins to make a difference and begins to address the area of increasing parental responsibility, giving them the opportunity to make resources available, and to also local districts and States, giving them the opportunity to provide those great teachers with the merit pay to which they are entitled. I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reinstate, and make permanent, the employee exclusion for amounts received under qualified employer-provided group legal services plans. 
This bill amends section 120 of the Internal Revenue Code and becomes effective for tax years beginning after June 30, 1998. It provides that an employee does not have to pay income and social security taxes for a qualified employer-provided group legal services plan. The annual premium is limited to $70 per person. In order to qualify, a plan must fulfill certain requirements, one of which states that benefits may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. 
The tax exclusion of group legal services is not a new provision. In fact, prior to its expiration in June of 1992, employees had been allowed to exclude such benefits from their gross income since 1976, albeit through seven extensions from Congress. I believe it is time to reinstate this measure on a permanent basis. 
Employer-provided group legal plans have time and again proven their value in extending low-cost legal advice to working Americans. The reality for middle class wage earners is that they cannot afford the services of an attorney and thus cannot afford to obtain advice for issues relating to child support enforcement, adoptions, wills, landlord/tenant situations and consumer debt problems. Because it provides access to legal advice, this employer-provided benefit assists working Americans in avoiding the family disintegration and job disruption that can result from neglected legal issues. 
In New York, these plans affect hundreds of thousands of employees and members of their families. These New Yorkers are employed as school teachers, municipal workers, hotel and hospital employees, law enforcement personnel and thousands working in our many service industries. Many of our citizens, though employed, are earning enough only for basic necessities. 
A working mother seeking to enforce an order of child support gains access to the assistance of a lawyer through these legal benefit plans and avoids the need to rely on public assistance. A consumer debt problem can lead to a garnished salary, and eviction, the loss of a job, and dependency on public assistance. The relatively minor cost of providing this favorable tax treatment is repaid innumerable times by keeping the wage earner focused on his/her job, keeping a family in housing and intact, and removing the threat to moderate income workers to remaining self-sufficient. 
Employer-provided legal benefit packages produce economies in both the purchase of legal services for a large group and in the delivery of those services at a reduced price. Because they provide a cost-effective approach, these employer-sponsored legal benefit plans are in the best American tradition of pragmatic, voluntary group action to meet common needs. 
Restoring equity to the tax treatment of this benefit by placing it on equal footing with other statutory fringe benefits is a goal worth achieving. As an aspect of middle class tax relief, a high return on the cost of this benefit is realized for the estimated 2.5 million working Americans who gain access to critical legal advice through its operation. 
Mr. President, there is no reason why we should not reinstate and make permanent this tax exclusion. In the past, the Senate repeatedly affirmed its commitment to assuring the availability of legal services. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to restore fair tax treatment of employer-provided group legal services.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am very appreciative of the problems which Senator Coats has alluded to as they relate to those States which are the recipients of large amounts of refuse, solid waste that comes from other States. Indeed, if I were a Senator from one of those States in which local communities, sometimes private landfill operations, enter into agreements and take large quantities, millions of tons of solid waste coming in, I would certainly understand why it is the Governor and/or the local officials would like to have some control with respect to the amount that comes in. 
Having said that, I am appreciative of the Senator's recognition of our concern, notwithstanding that we are a State, New York, that exports millions of tons annually because we simply do not have the ability to keep it, and are now closing down the largest landfill in the world, which will be closed in the year 2001. This is a concern to us, a very important and valid concern to the City of New York and to the State as well. If a law, and/or an agreement is entered into which would preclude us from using those areas for which we have negotiated long-term contracts, and indeed would restrict us, particularly at a time when landfills are closing down in New York and the problem will become more acute, we recognize we have to deal with those problems. 
Indeed, there are a number of contingencies which are being examined to dispose of this waste in the most environmentally sound and cost-effective manner. Plans are being developed, facilities are being built, land sites, new land sites within the State, are being utilized. There are a number and variety of communities that have entered into programs to recycle and to cut down on the volume. However, this is a monumental problem. Therefore, I appreciate the recognition by my colleague and friend of this problem, and I am going to ask that we have an opportunity--and I recognize people want to move on with this bill--to examine it carefully. 
I tell you, I respect, again, the candor of my colleague, Senator Coats, when the fact is the threshold, the ratcheting down threshold has been reduced from when last this legislation was accepted. We passed this overwhelmingly and we worked together cooperatively, and I think it passed by something like 94 to 6. It was an overwhelming vote. But that was in 1995. Since then, while the Senator is pointing out that his State is getting more garbage, we are producing more that does not go into landfills within our State, and therefore ratcheting down is something we could not feel comfortable with. This Senator could not say we will be ready to accept limitations that are further eroded and reduced. That is a very real problem. 
Second, the legislation is tied to a date, as my colleague indicates, that says, `those landfills that were receiving material, solid waste from out of State, as of 1993.' 
There have been, I am sure, a number of landfills that have opened up since 1993. So what this legislation would do, if passed in its present form, it would effectively deny New York or other States that export garbage the opportunity to continue that relationship they have with landfills or operations that have opened subsequent to 1993. I have to tell you, I do not know at this point how many tons of waste we would then not be able to dispose of, but it could be significant. If we were to have had a dozen additional sites nationwide opened up, we would 
find ourselves in a situation where we could no longer use them to dispose of any of the waste. 
So I would have to ask my friend to consider updating the 1993 date as a date to determine how you would ratchet this down. It would certainly have to be something closer to--and, indeed, in 1995 we used 1993. It would seem to me as we are into 1998, we would expect at least that same kind of consideration. Without even studying it, it would seem to me we would have to put in that date, if we are going to maintain some kind of symmetry. Those landfills that were in operation as of 1996, that that would be appropriate if we are going to maintain symmetry. 
Again, I haven't had a chance to check this with our State and ascertain whether in this short time they could tell us how many landfill sites have been opened, even between 1996 and today. But that is a concern, and I share that with my colleague. 
We have not had an opportunity to really discuss this. Yet, I am deeply appreciative of his concerns and his offer to try to work this out. So I hope that before attempting to move to vote on this, that we could see if we cannot get some cooperative agreement. I do not know what other colleagues in some of the exporting States would feel, but I am still of a mind that if we can be accommodating and meet our needs, I want to do that. But these are two very real concerns. 
No. 1, we cannot ratchet down an amount when we are producing more garbage than ever before, one that we had agreed to back in 1995. And, second, we would have to do something with the date of grandfathering those landfills. We would have to bring them up to a more current position so as to determine those which we may be using today which we were not using heretofore. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me say this: First of all, I appreciate the Senator's recognition of the fact that the ratchet figure has to be the same, or should be, and moving to do that. I understand he brings these requests at the request of his Governor. I do have a very serious concern, and that is, if one reads the legislation, it says: 
In 1999 a State may ban 95 percent of the amount exported to a State in 1993. 
That is a serious concern, understanding that, again, we are now 3 years further down the road. I don't know what the impact will be today. It is one thing to say, `Well, we agreed to that 3 years ago.' I am concerned, and, again, if we are going to talk about symmetry, at the very least it seems to me that that figure will have to read `exported to a State in 1996,' so that we maintain the same 2 years, the 2-year differential. 
I feel much more comfortable in saying let's move the process. 
And, indeed, if there are other things that have to be done, hopefully in conference we can work that out with the assurance of the chairman and the ranking member that we can deal with other areas. But these are issues of very significant proportions as they relate to our local governments. 
While I can understand the concern when an area is being inundated and people feel there is nothing they can do--the local legislatures--I understand that. I ask my colleague to understand what our concerns are if we have no place and valid contracts have been entered into subsequent to 1993 and we find now, as a result of moving along with this, they no longer have a place to dispose of it. 
Even moving it to 1996, I say, may not be sufficient, because we may have--and not in the State of Indiana, but in other jurisdictions--opened up facilities or are presently using facilities that have been opened maybe last year, and here I am in a position that I will be agreeing that these facilities will no longer be possibly available to us. That is why I am concerned, absent that information. 
If we go along with the year 1996, I hope my friend will recognize that is a very real accommodation, as opposed to 1993, and then take it on good faith that we will examine this, so that even if it goes to conference, we might have to lodge some kind of objection if we found that subsequent to 1996 there were facilities that were open that were substantial and necessary for us to accommodate the disposal of this waste. I want to be accommodating, but I have to state it in this manner so that we can both protect the interests of our States and our citizens. I think that is about as far as I can go on this. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Well, if the Senator would yield just for an observation, and I observe--and I am looking at the summary of the amendment. When I look at the summary of the amendment, as drawn, it says, in 1999, greater than 1.4 million tons or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1993. Now, what we would be agreeing to is that within less than 6 months--within 5 1/2 months--that we would agree that the following amounts could not be greater than 1.4 million tons or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1993. What I am saying is, I am willing to go along with the 1.4 million tons or 90 percent of that exported in 1996. OK. 
Now, let me also say that in 1 year and 5 1/2 months--if you go to the next year--it says in 2000, greater than 1.3 million tons. You go down to 1.3 million or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1999. 
So what I am suggesting is that I cannot in good conscience support an agreement when I do not know what we have done between 1993 and to date. But I am willing to take it up to 1996. And we are talking about 5 months. And then within a year you get the second figure that triggers off. So I am just talking about 1 year. 
You cannot ask us to put ourselves in the position to have us sign off on this. I think even taking 1996 is Russian roulette to the extent--I hate to say it is Russian roulette--but at least there is a symmetry between what we did before. And I only do this on the basis that when we go to conference, if indeed we have some severe problems, I will notify the committee. And if the Governor's office advises us there is no way they can possibly do it, I will notify the committee. And I think they would act responsibly to make the necessary changes or to drop the 
legislation. 
I have to be candid with you on this, so I suggest that is about as far as I could possibly go at this time. And I do it in the spirit of accommodation.

Mr. DAMATO. Sure. That is correct. And what I am suggesting--in other words, in 1999, 1.4 million or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1996; and I hope we can get that amount. Hopefully, the State will be able to give us those numbers, and hopefully all States would be able to give us those numbers. And thereafter I would say we have an agreement, because we are then holding to--if you read in 2000, it says greater than 1.3 million tons or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1999. So we are, then, at least, taking it on a rational basis as it relates to how much was actually exported.

And then we would rely on the committee chairman and the ranking member to help us and aid us in any further legislative language that might be needed.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I cosponsor the Children's Development Commission Act of 1998. I commend my friend and respected colleague, Senator Herb Kohl for introducing this critical piece of legislation which addresses a serious problem facing American families today--the shortage of affordable, quality child care. 
America is facing a shortage of quality child care which is approaching crisis levels. This shortage bears most heavily on working families, including young working single mothers. Every day more than 5 million children under age 13 are left unattended after school. The parents of these children deserve meaningful, affordable child care options. 
The high cost of child care impacts directly on families, affecting their ability to pay the rent or mortgage, to put food on the table or to save for their children's education. The lack of decent, high quality child care also impedes the development of critical learning skills these children will need in order to succeed later in life. Social and medical research continues to stress the importance of the first three years of development on a child's well-being and ability to learn. 
In New York, the average cost of day care is over $6,000 per year--and many families end up paying nearly $10,000 per year. Many families are unable to locate quality child care at all, as evidenced by the long waiting lists at existing centers. In New York City, approximately 28,000 families are on waiting lists for assistance under the Child Care Development Block Grant Program. 
Mr. President, as more families make the difficult transition from welfare to work, waiting lists for affordable care and assistance will likely increase significantly. As a result of welfare reform, by the year 2002, there may be as many as 135,000 additional infants and toddlers in New York who will need affordable quality child care. 
These high costs and the overall shortage of quality care are found in all areas of my home State--cutting across urban and rural boundaries. The New York Human Services Administration estimates that more than two-thirds of children in the Morrisania section of the Bronx and more than seventy percent of children in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn are in need of child care. 
This shortage extends to rural areas of New York as well--for example, in Allegany, Hamilton, Washington and Yates counties there are no registered programs for school age children. Twenty of my State's sixty two counties have three or fewer registered school-age programs. 
The Child Care Development Commission Act will employ a number of cost-effective strategies to increase the availability and affordability of child care throughout the nation. 
First, the legislation would reduce lender risk by creating a new insurance authority within the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Using this new authority, FHA will provide loan guarantees for child care facilities. This will in turn spur the provision of private capital for the construction of new child care centers, the improvement of existing facilities and the cost of purchasing and installing fire safety equipment. 
Second, the Act will create a new streamlined Commission--known informally as `Kiddie Mac.' The Commission will provide reasonable low-cost `micro-loans' for the renovation and improvement of existing facilities. In addition, the Commission will certify that facilities receiving FHA insurance meet state and local standards, such as licensing and child safety requirements. 
Mr. President, The Children's Development Commission Act is an important step in ensuring that child care facilities can gain access to private market credit. Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Richard Baker have introduced companion legislation (H.R. 3637) in the House of Representatives. They deserve our praise for their diligence in addressing this issue. 
The Children's Development Commission Act makes an investment in our children, an investment in our families and an investment in our future. I look forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues for its enactment.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Captain Michael J. Landers, United States Navy, as he retires upon completion of over 30 years of honorable and faithful service to our Nation. 
A native of Utica, NY, Captain Landers was enlisted into the Regular Navy in November 1968 as a Seaman Recruit. After 5 years of enlisted submarine service, he was commissioned an Ensign upon graduation from the University of Missouri in December 1973. 
Captain Landers, a Submarine Warfare Officer, has performed in a consistently outstanding manner under the most challenging of circumstances. From 1973 to 1985 Captain Landers served with the surface and submarine fleets of the Atlantic and pacific Oceans. He gained extensive experience aboard USS ALEXANDER HAMILTON (SSBN) 617) USS VON STEUBEN (SSBN 632), and USS PIGEON (ASR 21). After serving on the staff of the Director of Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, DC, Captain Landers commanded the USS ORTOLAN (ASR 22) from 1987 to 1990. He subsequently became the Executive Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Personnel. Captain Landers left the Navy Annex in 1994 and reported for duty at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces at Fort McNair where he received a Master of Science Degree in National Resource Strategy. 
From 1995 to 1997, Captain Landers commanded the naval Submarine Base, Bangor, WA. He returned to the Pentagon in November 1997, where he served as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity he has been a major asset to the Navy, Marine Corps and Congress. He is considered a valued advisor to the very top echelons of the Navy and Congress. His consummate leadership, energy and integrity ensured that the morale and effectiveness of the Navy-Marine Corps team reached heights otherwise thought to be impossible to achieve in such an austere budget climate. During a period of significant change and restructuring of naval forces, Captain Landers helped to obtain Congressional support for a strong and balanced navy and marine Corps. Through his brilliant insight, he has directly contributed to their future readiness and success. 
Captain Landers' distinguished awards include the legion of Merit with three gold stars, the meritorious Service medal with one gold star, the navy Commendation Medal with two gold stars and the navy Achievement Medal with one gold star. 
The Department of the navy, the Congress, and the American people have been defended and well served by this dedicated naval officer for over 30 years. Captain Mike Landers will long be remembered for his leadership, service and dedication. He will be missed. We wish Mike, and his lovely wife Kris, our very best as they begin a new chapter in their life together.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will create a new homeownership opportunity with a proven method of building affordable housing. Current low-income housing production in the United States is driven largely by the low-income housing tax credit. The credit supports the development of 94 percent of all federally assisted multi-family affordable housing construction. Under current law, however, only rental housing can be developed with the credit. Everyone would agree that building homeownership is better than simply building homes for people. Homeowners are invested in their communities, take pride in their property, and will do what it takes to preserve the security and appearance of their homes. 
The legislation that I propose today will enable housing cooperatives and mutual housing associations to be developed with the credit. With these types of multi-family homeownership, tax credit investors can become non-resident shareholders of the developed property while allowing the residents to own their share of the property as well. From the very start, the residents will have a real ownership stake and control over their homes. 
A study undertaken by Abt Associates, Inc., commissioned by the National Cooperative Bank found that this legislation could result in the annual production of 1,600 units of low-income housing within five years of enactment. That means as many as 15,000 renters could be homeowners within five years. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring legislation to help bring the American dream of homeownership to many more Americans. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be placed in the Record.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today Senator Sarbanes, the distinguished Ranking Member on the Senate Banking Committee, and I have announced that we will hold hearings on June 17th to begin the process of Senate consideration of the Financial Services Act of 1998, recently passed by the House of Representatives. 
America is the financial leader of the world, and New York is the capital. But we cannot remain complacent. We must recognize that the world is changing and global competition is tougher than ever. We must meet this change head on. If we are to remain competitive and maintain our preeminent position in the marketplace, we must provide a climate that allows our financial system to be as efficient, and competitive as possible. 
Mr. President, simply put, financial modernization will provide consumers with more choices. Financial institutions will be able to provide even more diverse services. Insurance companies, securities firms, brokerage houses, local banks and other institutions will be allowed to compete fairly with one another. But we must remember that while expanding the freedom of every American to make their financial choices, we must not sacrifice the safety and soundness or place the taxpayers at risk. 
The issues surrounding financial modernization have in the past proven to contentious. Our hearing next month will allow an open and frank dialogue with the Administration, industry groups and consumers.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on an issue that concerns many Americans, religious intolerance in Europe. As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I chaired a hearing on September 18, 1997, on `Religious Intolerance in Europe Today.' We heard compelling testimony on the rise of religious intolerance in Europe from representatives of the Muslim and Jewish faiths, Orthodox Church, Roman Catholic Church, an evangelical Protestant church, the Church of the Latter Day Saints, Jehovah's Witness, and the Church of Scientology. 
The testimony indicated the following: 
Muslims in Europe have been subjected to genocide, mass killings, forced migration and torture, including rape, in the former Yugoslavia; harassment, including police brutality and attacks and other hate crimes by extremist groups against Muslims have been reported throughout Europe, particularly in Germany, France and the United Kingdom; Muslims have been denied permits to build or repair mosques in the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and elsewhere in Europe; Muslim women are frequently the subject of attacks, discrimination and other forms of abuse and harassment because they choose to wear a head covering; 
Struggling Jewish communities in Eastern Europe are often made the scapegoats for the pain of the transition from centrally planned economies to market capitalism; the desecration of Jewish cemeteries and memorials has been on the rise; and anti-Semitic publications, such as The Protocols of Zion, and neo-Nazi computer games have received wider distribution accompanied by the rise of skinhead gangs and hatemongers throughout Europe; 
The Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate has been subject to recurring acts of violence, and faces serious obstacles imposed by the Government of Turkey, including the closing of the Theological School of Halki, which have a detrimental impact on the activities of the Patriarchate and Orthodox believers in Turkey; 
Catholic believers face harassment and violence in parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as well as Northern Ireland, and they face serious impediments to the practice of their faith elsewhere in Europe, including in Belarus, Russia, Greece, Turkey, and Romania; 
Some evangelical and charismatic Christian churches have been denied registration by the Governments of Bulgaria, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Greece and have been harassed, as well as have reportedly had religious materials confiscated; at least one charismatic church in Germany has come under intense scrutiny by the local officials and the German Bundestag's Commission of Inquiry on So-called Sects and Psycho-Groups, faced other forms of harassment, and been the target of vandalism and threats of violence; 
Jehovah's Witnesses have been denied registration in a number of OSCE participating States, including Armenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, and Latvia; have been subjected to various forms of harassment, including the prohibition on importation of religious literature and denial of the freedom to assemble for worship services; France's Parliamentary Commission on Sects has categorized Jehovah's Witnesses as a `criminal sect' for its prohibition against blood transfusions; Germany's Federal Administrative Court has denied legal status to the Jehovah's Witnesses; 
Mormons have been subjected to continued acts of harassment, including confiscation of religious materials, and assault, in Bulgaria; and are prevented from freely sharing their beliefs in several OSCE participating States, including Greece and Turkey; and 
Scientologists, including U.S. citizens, have been subjected to pervasive civil, political and economic discrimination, harassment, surveillance, and orchestrated boycotts in Germany. 
In the months following this hearing, the Helsinki Commission has noted a chilling effect on religious liberty from actions taken by national parliaments. A law passed on December 10, 1997 by the Austrian Parliament requires that a religious group prove a 20-year existence, have a creed distinct from previously registered groups, and have a membership of at least 0.02% of the population or 16,000 members before they are granted full rights under law. Concerns over this law were raised in Vienna by a Helsinki Commission delegation this past January. A similar law was passed in 1997 in Macedonia. In January 1998, a Helsinki Commission delegation, lead by Co-Chairman Christopher Smith, traveled to Moscow to discuss concerns with the 1997 Russian religion law with Russian government officials, minority religious groups, and the Russian Orthodox Church. 
Some governments have passed laws creating government information centers to alert the public to `dangerous' groups. The Austrian and Belgian governments have set up hotlines for the public and, through government sponsored advisory centers, distribute information on groups deemed `dangerous.' In official Austrian literature, Jehovah's Witnesses are labeled `dangerous' and members of this group report that 
the stigma associated with this government label is difficult to overcome in Austrian society. These information centers directly violate the commitments that Austria and Belgium have made as participating States of the OSCE to `foster a climate of mutual tolerance and respect,' in paragraph 16 of the Vienna Concluding Document, and represent excessive governmental intrusion into the public discussion on religious matters. 
Several western European Parliaments have or are currently investigating and reporting on the activities of minority religious groups. These parliamentary investigations have also had a chilling effect on religious liberty and appear to cause a public backlash against groups being investigated or labeled `dangerous.' For instance, the German Parliament is currently conducting its investigation into `dangerous sects' and `psycho-groups' and issued an interim report in January 1998. At the Helsinki Commission's September 18 hearing, at least one independent evangelical church reported a direct correlation between the harassment, vandalism and threats of violence they experience and the investigation by the German Parliament's commission. The French Parliament's report contained a list of `dangerous' groups in order to warn the public against them and the Belgian Parliament's report had an informal appendix which was widely circulated, which included allegations against many mainline Catholic groups, Quakers, Hasidic Jews, Buddhists, and the YWCA (although not the YMCA). 
On Wednesday, May 20, 1998, a coalition of religious groups, including Hasidic Jews, Hindu, Bahia, Seventh Day Adventist, evangelical Protestant and charismatic Catholic communities, Plan to hold a press conference in Brussels to announce that they are about to launch a court challenge to the Belgian Parliamentary Report and the Belgian Government's Advice and Information Center. The premise of the legal challenge is that these actions by the Belgian government violate Belgium's international commitments to religious liberty. I am pleased to see these and other groups such as Human Rights Without Frontiers standing up for this fundamental freedom, and acting to highlight and challenge the actions by European governments that violate the Helsinki Accords and other international commitments on religious liberty. 
Mr. President, the recent action by the House adopting the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, and pending consideration of that bill and parallel measures in the Senate, clearly show that this issue is one that concerns Americans. Many Americans have family or friends who are citizens in countries that have solemnly promised to protect religious liberty, but then restrict it or deny it. Many Americans, through their own religious affiliations, make donations to support the work of their denominations outside this country, or take part in that work themselves as a personal expression of their beliefs. Actions taken by foreign governments that have promised to protect religious liberty and then violate these promises can and do directly affect American citizens during their travels for business or pleasure, when they support the overseas religious efforts of their faiths by donations or personal participation, or through negative effects on their relatives and friends who reside in these countries. 
Accordingly, I call upon my colleagues to remain vigilant on this subject, and assure them and all Americans that the Commission will remain active and engaged as we seek to document violations and protect the rights of affected persons.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I see the Senator from California on the floor and I would like to give her whatever part of my time that might be left because this is in regard to legislation that I think is so important. It is important for the psychology of the women of America who, unfortunately, will be diagnosed with breast cancer. It is important in their medical treatment. It is important to their families. It is important to the community. It is important to let people know we are serious in our battle to win the fight against breast cancer and to see that those who are diagnosed get the proper treatment and don't have some medical plan or medical director who says that--as a result of the ERISA laws passed more than 20 years ago--we don't have to provide you basic coverage; we don't have to say that reconstructive surgery is covered. And, indeed, we have had plans today in America where millions of women face being denied basic coverage as it relates to cancer and its treatment and the reconstructive surgery that is necessary. 
On January 30, 1997, Senator Feinstein and myself, along with a dozen or more colleagues--now 21--introduced the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act. We have amended that and, indeed, put some provisions aside, and we have reduced it to two main parts. No. 1, no bean counter, no statistician can set an 
arbitrary limit on the length of time that a woman takes after a medical procedure for breast cancer. Some plans limit her stay to 24 hours. Imagine that. If there are complications, it is too bad. She and her family then have to pay for any longer stay. That is unconscionable. The decision in terms of the length of stay should be predicated upon the needs of that patient. That determination should be made according to the medical necessity and by her physician, not some bean counter who arbitrarily looks at a policy and says, `We won't pay for more than 24 hours.' We say that decision should be made as the medical necessity requires. 
The second major provision of that bill is that reconstructive surgery will not be treated as something optional or cosmetic. Let me refer to the case of a young woman. This past February, not that long ago, her doctor called me. Dr. Wider of Long Island said to me, `Janet Franquet, a 31-year-old woman, needs a radical mastectomy. When I contacted her medical plan, the medical director said that they would not authorize payment for reconstructive surgery.' Here is a young woman, 31 years of age. I called the director of that plan, Dr. Hodos, and I said to him, `How could you be saying that this is not necessary?' He said, `Replacement of a breast is not medically necessary and not covered under the plan.' Then he said, `This is not a bodily function and therefore cannot and should not be replaced.' 
That is not an isolated case, Mr. President. The women of America--our mothers, daughters, sisters, neighbors, friends--should know that they are covered. 
Let me tell you something. The sorry history of this legislation is that, in spite of Senator Feinstein, myself, Senator Snowe, and I think every woman Senator who signed on to support this bill--I have colleagues who say we should not legislate by body part. Imagine that. We should not mandate that. You are right, we should not have to mandate it. But the situation requires that. Then we get others who say, oh, no, we are not going to let you have a vote on this bill until or unless you let us have a vote on some other legislation. What nonsense--to hold the women of America captive. 
Senator Feinstein and I, and a number of colleagues, have decided that we will bring this legislation up and offer it as an amendment on every piece of legislation that goes through here that is vital, where there is a bipartisan interest in seeing this pass. We are going to put it on. Indeed, at some point in time, we may hold this assembly hostage. 
When the wheels slow down--understand, it is almost a year and a half now we have been trying to get this vote. I don't want people saying we are attempting to work our will against the majority. We backed down on the education bill; we took it off the IRS reform bill. We introduced this bill on January 30, 1997, 14 months ago. We brought it up during the consideration of IRS reform. We lost in committee. We got six votes. We brought it up again. In terms of the package that has just gone by, we brought it up and it was rejected 6 to 6 during the A+ education bill. We brought it up on the IRS bill during committee and we lost 8 to 10. We brought it up again today and we won 11 to 9. It is on the tobacco bill and it will be coming to this floor. 
When people say `what relevance,' we are talking about the health of American women. Indeed, I am prepared to offer it as an amendment to the defense bill, because we spend defense 
funds, as Senator Feinstein says, for cancer research and the defense of the families, and the women of America should not be shelved by partisan considerations or some ideological philosophy that says we can't have mandates. We have mandates every day. And some of the same people who voted against this bill vote for mandates every day. That is nonsense. It is too bad we need this. 
So this has been reported out 11 to 9 and will be on the tobacco bill. I thank the 11 members on the Finance Committee who voted for it. But understand, this Senator is serious. We are going to continue until this `win' turns into a real win and America's women do not have to be held hostage any longer. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I simply would like to say that I have never encountered such graciousness, such tenacity, such great dedication to a cause than the Senator from California has given to this effort for the past almost year and a half; and what a great fighter she is for all of the families of this country.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. 
The Banking Committee reported this bill on April 29 by an overwhelming vote of 14-4. This bill has strong bipartisan support. It comes as no surprise to anybody who has followed the progress of this legislation. This bill is the product of a great deal of hard work. It has been refined through the incorporation of comments from many sources, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result of this process, this bill not only has been improved, but it actually enjoys the support of the Securities Exchange Commission and the White House.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I took the time to go through this because I think it is important that we understand that this has not been the product of one staff or two staffs. This has not been the product of just the Banking Committee and those in industry who have come to express their concern as to how it is that their class actions are being brought in a frivolous manner, using the State courts to get around what Congress debated and what Congress voted overwhelmingly to bring, which is a standard of conduct that will discourage a race to the courthouse, simply to bring a suit and simply to extort moneys from those who have deep pockets, because these suits can be long, they can be frivolous, and they can be dragged out. The cost factor to the people being sued is enormous--the time, the distraction, particularly to startup companies, and particularly those who want to let people know what they are doing, but who felt restricted as a result of the suits that were brought. 
I am not going to bother going into the history and the comments that have been made by many. But indeed there have been many, which clearly are a stain on the rightful practice of law to ensure the rights of those who have been aggrieved and would hold people responsible for actions that are not tortious, malicious, malevolent, and indeed when there are no actions that should be sustained under any court, but because of the cost involved would have insurance carriers, accountants firms, securities firms, manufacturers, and others, be held to a situation where they have to settle. Who do they settle with? They settle with the moneys that come from the little guy--their stockholders. So while we say `stockholder derivative actions,' the people hurt are indeed the stockholders. 
Mr. President, I mentioned two letters. Let me read a second letter. 
The second letter is dated a month later to myself as Chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Gramm as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities, Senator Dodd as ranking Member of that Committee, from the White House, dated April 28, 1998.  
Dear Chairman D'Amato, Chairman Gramm, and Senator Dodd: We understand that you have had productive discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997. The Administration applauds the constructive approach that you have taken to resolve the SEC's concerns. 
We support the amendments to clarify that the bill will not preempt certain corporate governance claims and to narrow the definition of class action. More importantly, we are pleased to see your commitment, by letter dated March 24, 1998, to Chairman Levitt and members of the Commission, to restate in S. 1260's legislative history, and in the expected debate on the Senate floor, that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 did not, and was not intended to, alter the Scienter standard for securities fraud actions. 
As you know, uncertainty about the impact of the Reform Act on the scienter standard was one of the President's greatest concerns. The legislative history and floor statements that you have promised the SEC and will accompany S. 1260 should reduce confusion in the courts about the proper interpretation of the Reform Act. Since the uniform standards provided by S. 1260 will provide that class actions generally can be brought only in federal court, where they will be governed by federal law, it is particularly important to the President that you be clear that the federal law to be applied includes recklessness as a basis for pleading and liability in securities fraud class actions. 
So long as the amendments designed to address the SEC's concerns are added to the legislation and the appropriate legislative history and floor statements on the subject of legislative intent are included in the legislative record, the Administration would support enactment of S. 1260. 
Sincerely,

Senator Gramm, who has worked with the Senator from Connecticut, would like to be heard, and Senator Feingold has been waiting.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Wisconsin for coming forth with this proposal. It is an amendment that he has been working on, for quite a period of time. As a matter of fact, it has been referred to the Judiciary Committee. 
Having said that, I think at the very least it should have, and requires, a thorough hearing. It is important, and it is important we understand the nuances. It is important that we get the case-by-case documentation as relates to those people who have suffered as a result of this area of the law. It is an area of great concern in terms of whether or not a person has to sign an agreement--and they do now--prior to employment, that they give away or they agree that all matters will be settled by way of arbitration. 
Maybe it should not be `all matters.' Maybe there are certain matters that no one should ever be required to forfeit. I think we should look at that, because I think there are some very real questions. If there is a question of sexual harassment, do you mean to tell me that a person in that case should have to give up his or her right to bring a claim and that it will be settled in camera, behind the scenes, by way of arbitration? And there may be 
other areas where, indeed, the arbitration procedure should be the methodology of resolving a dispute. 
But I believe the Senator is correct, that there are some areas that really call into question whether or not a person must sign this agreement, otherwise he or she doesn't get the job. They just never get the job. They never get the promotion. So what do you think they are going to do? Of course they are going to sign. So this is serious. 
I believe we have an obligation to have a thorough, thoughtful analysis, and, indeed, the Judiciary Committee may want to look at certain aspects. But I believe since, indeed, the financial services community, the banking community, the securities community has to deal with this day in and day out, the proper jurisdiction does lie before the Banking Committee. 
With that in mind, I have indicated to the Senator that, before we leave, during the month of July or prior, it will be my intent to hold at least a full hearing, where witnesses to both sides, including the Securities and Exchange Commission--which I understand is studying this matter very carefully--will appear so we could have the benefit of their review, of their testimony, of people who have written and people who have been involved in this, those who have been aggrieved as well as those who can testify to the merits of certain aspects of having arbitration in some limited cases. 
But I must say for the record, I believe the Senator has touched on something that is very important and I would not like to move to table at this time. I think it would be unfair to the importance of this legislation. 
With that in view, I have indicated to the Senator that I will call these hearings, so we can fully explore this and then bring it to this floor as legislation that has had the benefit of the totality of the input from the SEC, from our staffs, after listening and hearing and getting the kind of in-depth review that I know that not only I feel should take place, but that most of the members of my committee would support.

Mr. DAMATO. I am sympathetic to the SEC's concerns. In acting now to establish uniform national standards, it is important that we make clear our understanding of the standards created by the '95 Reform Act because those are the standards that will apply if S. 1260 is enacted into law. My clear intent in 1995, and my understanding today, is that the PSLRA did not in any way alter the scienter standard in federal securities fraud lawsuits. The '95 Reform Act requires plaintiffs, and I quote, `to the state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.' The '95 Reform Act makes no attempt to alter or define that state of mind. In addition, it was my intent in 1995, and it is my understanding today, that the '95 Reform Act adopted the pleading standard applied in the Second Circuit.

Mr. DAMATO. My friend from Connecticut is correct. The federal securities laws must include a scienter requirement that adequately protects investors. I was surprised and dismayed to learn that some district court decisions had not followed the clear language of the '95 Reform Act, which is the basis upon which the uniform national standard in today's legislation will be created.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I believe that my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, is going to speak to this amendment. This amendment would indeed promote forum shopping for those lawyers to look for the State that had the longest statute of limitations. 
I point out the Lampf decision, which will be referred to. After that decision, in a sample of actions brought in the State courts, 43 of them were filed within the 4-year period of time--43 out of a total of 44. So we do not believe this amendment will do anything other than to promote forum shopping for the longest period of time, and that it really counteracts the Supreme Court's decision, which has not worked a hardship on plaintiffs who have a legitimate suit or seek to bring it. 
Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, we cannot confirm that it is the intention of the leadership on both sides to curtail votes as of any specific time. However, it would seem to me to be appropriate, notwithstanding that, to move to support the Senator's request that we stack the two amendments with a vote starting at 5:40 for the first one, and thereafter undertake a vote on the second one. Then, of course, if the leadership has decided no further votes, we can put that matter over. 
We are looking to shop that right now. I believe that will be the case, but we are waiting for final confirmation. If the Senator wishes to make his request on the basis that we will proceed to our first vote at 5:40 on the pending amendment and that thereafter, immediately after that vote, take up the second amendment and seek a vote on that, I will certainly join in that request.

<DOCNO>105-damato-ny-25-19980513</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me tell you basically what this amendment would do. This amendment would have the unintended effect--and I cannot believe that my colleague would want for that to happen--of opening up the whole question of the class-action suits being able to be moved to State courts. It would effectively allow lawyers to circumvent the purpose, the very 
purpose of this bill since so-called `huge' mass actions could still be brought in the State court. 
So what we have is the problem of high-growth companies, small high-growth companies that traditional class actions may be brought against by the strike lawyers; namely, they are expensive and timely to defend, and the plaintiffs are often forced to settle, regardless of the merits, to avoid excessive litigation costs. That is exactly what we are trying to deal with. There should be a uniform standard, and there should be a uniform procedure. And that is why we moved these nationally traded securities. 
Senator Dodd spoke to this, the nationally traded securities going to a Federal forum. This amendment changes the predominance requirements in the bill's class action definition. This effectively would gut the bill by encouraging State actions which would not qualify as a class action contained in the act. As a result, these class actions would not be able to be removed to the Federal court. And so you have mass action lawyers representing a large number of plaintiffs on an individual basis in either a single action or a group action. 
The `class action' definition in the bill was worked out with the SEC. We have worked that out, and it is comprehensive enough to close the loophole. But it also provides State courts with guidance. It says `up to 50 people.' That is the bright line. When you get over 50 people, OK, that is the class action. And so this bill does not prevent individual investors from pursuing State court remedies, nor will it prevent a small group of investors from pooling their resources to pursue a claim under State law, but it will stop the strike action suits, the forum shopping that we have attempted to limit, because we have seen that dramatic increase. 
I think Senator Dodd, when he pointed out what the record was, I think it was a handful, what, five or six cases in a period of years, in all of the years, ballooning up to 40-plus in 1 year. What was that?

And that is why the necessity of seeing to it that we have a uniform standard, that you cannot go forum shopping. And that is why this Senator, at the appropriate time, will move to table the pending amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, again let me say it is one thing to say they are not being tied together, but that is exactly what is taking place. Let me take the time to point out, if I might, that the legislation that has been crafted with the help and consultation of my colleague, Senator Feinstein from California, from the beginning is not controversial, absolutely not controversial and is necessary. To take a bill that is so straightforward and tie it up in procedural knots--and that is what is happening here--so that the women of America, because of these procedures today, are being denied health care that they need, reconstructive surgery, drive-by mastectomies, being put on the streets or being told we are not going to pay for more than 24 hours or 48 hours or whatever the policy limits may be, regardless of the medical necessity, we are not going to pay for reconstructive surgery because, as one plan said and a doctor told me, `It doesn't serve a bodily function so therefore we don't have to have reconstructive surgery,' is absolutely wrong. 
This is an issue that everyone can support and should support, and we should not tie it down with legislation by its very nature that is so comprehensive as the Patients' Bill of Rights that takes in a myriad of programs and projects, et cetera, many of them that have arguments on both sides. To say that we are going to give one 2 hours and the other 2 hours, which is so complex, is just absolutely using the procedure to stifle this straightforward bill which says we will give women the right without having to appeal to various boards, et cetera, to reconstructive surgery and to know that they are not going to be forced to leave a hospital before it is the right time to do so. 
That is what we are talking about here. So we are forced to object. I am sorry that the distinguished leader on the other side is using that as a cover for precluding--and by the way, we may have some Members on the Republican side, I might want to add, who will seek to amend this, who are out of line, I believe, and who will hide behind this and do not have the courage to come down here and to vote up or down. And I would like to see them offer amendments because I have had some colleagues--let's be very candid--to say, `We are going to offer a killer amendment.' 
Why? Let me give you the argument on the other side. `We don't want mandates.' Let me give you another one. One of my distinguished colleagues says, `We shouldn't have legislation by body part.' Well, it is too bad, he is right, that we would have to reach this time and this place that it demands that. How much longer should the women of America have to wait? How many years, how many months do we really tie it up? And let me say this to you: This Senator is going to go forward. I know that my colleagues on the Democrat side, and there are many of them, feel equally passionate, and we are going to go forward and we are going to have a vote on this amendment. It is a straightforward piece of legislation. 
I see my colleague, Senator Feinstein, is seeking to speak on this, and I am going to----

Mr. DAMATO. I understand that, and let me respond by saying that I wish I could and did have the authority to accept that because I would do it, because I think we should have a full debate and a full discussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights. And I think it will not be limited, should not be limited to 2 hours. I thank my colleague, the Senate minority leader, for recognizing the complexity of the bill that is, I don't know how many pages. It is voluminous. And it is important. 
Here it is. I don't know whether it has even had a hearing. It is 109 pages. It is controversial, to say the least. And there are many parts of this bill which I would be supporting. There is absolutely no doubt about it.

Mr. DAMATO. However, we are linking the two together. By suggesting that in order to get this straightforward bill, this legislation that says no more drive-by mastectomies and that women will be guaranteed the right to have reconstructive surgery where there is a radical mastectomy, it is linking the two together. I think that is unfortunate. I might be willing to come and join my colleagues and battle for a date certain or to fight for hearings at least. I don't know whether we have had hearings. I don't think we have. I see Senator Kennedy here. 
But the point of the matter is that we are linking the two. We are saying we are not going to consider whether women should have that right. Where I don't believe there is one Senator here who feels they should not have, not one, why should we link the two, with one bill 109 pages, which 90 percent of the Members have not read, have not studied, have not gone through. Again, it is linkage, and therefore I am compelled to say that notwithstanding the good intents of my friend, it is linkage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let's look at this in perspective. I have asked staff has there been a hearing with respect to S. 1890, a bill that is over 100 pages, the complexities of which, everyone has to admit, go well beyond a very straightforward, very limited bill which we believe guarantees women a right that I don't think there is one person here who could object to, and that is, length of stay should be determined by the medical necessity of the procedure; and, second, that reconstructive surgery should be a woman's right. She should not have to go to appeal to some board or some insurance plan because ERISA prevents States from having legislation that would order this. 
Let me say this. We have had a hearing on S. 249, and we have had two votes to attempt to get it. Senator Feinstein, myself, and others--and I might say our bill has broad, bipartisan support. There is not one Member on the Patients' Bill of Rights from the Republican Party. You can say that you are not linking, you can say you are not blocking, but that is exactly what has happened. The women of America are being denied a right to something that they should have--that we should enact into law, and we should be proud, and all 100 Senators should come down and vote for this and sponsor this--because we want the Patients' Bill of Rights to be heard at a particular time and we are linking the two. That is exactly what is happening. 
I could support various provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights--the clinical trials. I think we should have them. I want to support them. But to say that we should deny the women of America an opportunity to be heard on this and to have a vote on this is counterproductive; it is wrong. It is a shame that the Senate operates in this manner. 
But everyone has a right to be heard. Everyone has a right to make their objections. I think it is unfortunate. My friend and colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, has been waiting very patiently. If I might--

Mr. DAMATO. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. 
Let me say that we worked long and hard on this. We have many of our colleagues who, because of their commitment to deal with this--it is tragic when it hits a family it has so much of an impact--said you have to have at least 48 hours. In other words, 72 hours. And we finally have been working with the people in the medical community, and I must say we built a consensus where we recognize that we should not put any time limitation whatsoever. 
If I might, Mr. President, we have the Senator from Montana who is waiting to make a statement. Might I propound a unanimous consent request that he be permitted to speak for up to 3 or 4 minutes as if in morning business, and that might we also have an additional 5 minutes then--we started late--so that he could make his statement, and then without my losing the right to continue and to hold the floor and continue our discussion with respect to this?

I have women calling and saying they are being denied reconstructive surgery, being denied the kind of health care that everybody agrees on. We have found a methodology of paying for this, and it is not right to tie it to something so comprehensive and say, `unless we get this one, we are not going to get the other.' 
The women of America are being denied this. I intend to hold hostage, with my colleagues, important legislation that moves through until we get a vote on this--whether it is on a defense bill, a tobacco bill, appropriations bills. When we come down to the floor and--

Again, it is disingenuous to suggest that we would have to consider both when one is so clear cut, and the need is so necessary, and women are being denied. That is what is going on here. It is wrong. So when we have a bill that is going to be acted on, I will come to the floor--I hope with a number of my colleagues--to offer this legislation as an amendment and get a vote. Let the people of America see this. The people are going to be so full of pride that we will not allow something that is so obviously necessary that they are going to hold it hostage, because that is what is taking place with this 
legislation. It has been held hostage, and it is disingenuous to come down here and say you have to take this great big piece of legislation or we can't even let the women of America have freedom from the fear that they will be denied that which they should have--reconstructive surgery and to stay in the hospital until their doctor says now is the time to go home, not a bean counter, someone who limits you to 24 or 48 hours. 
I hope my colleagues will join with me in this endeavor, making it a bipartisan fight to see that the women and families of America get justice.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Frank A. Cipriani, whose long and outstanding career as president of SUNY Farmingdale will be celebrated with much pomp on Wednesday, May 20, 1998. 
Dr. Cipriani's outstanding qualities of enlightened leadership and innovation brought unprecedented success to SUNY Farmingdale. Dr. Cipriani took the school from a two year agrarian institution to a four-year college, one of the largest of the nine Colleges of Technology in the New York State University system. 
His great success is readily visible on the SUNY Farmingdale Campus. Mr. Cipriani's other associations and affiliations are not as well known but are worthy of commendation. They include: Team Chairman for the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Evaluation; Chairman of the Board, Regional Industrial Technical Education; Member, New York State-wide Job Training Partnership Council; Member, New York State Education Department's Advisory Council on Postsecondary Education; just to name a few of the associations and affiliations that demonstrate the special concern that Dr. Cipriani has for education. 
Born in New York of immigrant parents, Dr. Cipriani has been a New Yorker all of his life, with the exception of a stint in the United States Air Force. He attended PS 14 in Corona, Queens, and Brooklyn Technical High School, and holds the A.B. degree from Queens College and the M.A. and Ph.D. Degrees from New York University. 
Dr. Cipriani was an officer in the United States Air Force who achieved the rank of Captain and the rating of Navigator-Flight Instructor before receiving an honorable discharge. As a member of the American Society of Safety Engineers, he pursued his graduate studies while employed in the Engineering Department of an international insurance company. He speaks Italian and French fluently, and has been a strong advocate of international education and a strong supporter of a humanities component in technical education curricula. 
Dr. Cipriani is married to Judith M. Pellathy and has four children--Maria, Frank, Michael and Dominique. 
His accomplishments are varied and great and we might say that Dr. Frank A. Cipriani is the salt of the earth. He has done much for SUNY Farmingdale and for the state of New York. It is no wonder that such a fine celebration is being prepared to commemorate his twenty years of service to such a fine institution. Frank, I salute you and wish you much health and happiness in the days to come.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to proudly announce two celebrations of major historical achievement. Our first event is the 50th Anniversary of His Ordination to the Service of Our Lord, the Pastor, Reverend Monsignor John R. Gabalski, P.A. The second event is the 125th Anniversary of St. Stanislaus R. C. Church, B.M. The first event will take place on Saturday, May 23, 1998, with a Mass of Thanksgiving in St. Stanislaus R. C. Church at 4:00 p.m. A banquet will follow at the Rt. Rev. Msgr. Peter J. Adamski Social Center, 389 Peckham Street, Buffalo New York. The second event will take place on Sunday, June 7, 1998 at 4:00 p.m. with a Mass of Thanksgiving with his Excellency, Bishop Henry J. Mansell, Ordinary, of the Diocese of Buffalo. A civic reception will follow at the Hearthstone Manor, 333 Dick Rd., Depew, New York. 
Rt. Rev. Msgr. Gabalski, P.A., attended school at SS. Cyril and Methodius Seminary Orchard Lake in February 1945 to May 1948 and was ordained on May 22, 1948 in Buffalo's St. Joseph New Cathedral by Most Rev. John F. O'Hara. The Reverend attended undergraduate studies at Canisius College for math; Norte Dame and Catholic University, Washington for adolescent psychology; and at Manhattanville, New York for music. In June 1948-August 1949 Msgr. Gabalski attended graduate school at De Paul University, Chicago for Polish and in 1949 received his M.A. in Polish. He also attended graduate studies in language at the University of Detroit and obtained a M.E. in education at Canisius in 1968. Msgr. Gabalski has accomplished many achievements too numerous to count and has spent much of his time volunteering with different organizations. He was a Pastor of Queen of Peace from June 1974 to February 1978. Moreover, Reverend Gabalski was a 16-year member at the Orchard Lake Michigan Schools and a faculty member and Director of the Diocesan Preparatory Seminary. Reverend Gabalski started pastoring St. Stanislaus in February 1978. We compliment Msgr. Gabalski with his accomplishments with the church and outside achievements. 
The second event is a great milestone in the history of St. Stanislaus R.C. Church which is the 5th oldest parish and the 1st oldest Polish parish in the Diocese of Buffalo. The nucleus of the first Polish parish in Western New York was formed in 1872 under the direction of the Rev. Ivannef Gartner and a recent immigrant, Joseph Kujawski. According to the 1870 United States census, there were no less than 135 natives of Poland within the city limits of Buffalo. John Pitass, on June 8, 1873, organized St. Stanislaus Parish at a meeting of the St. Stanislaus Society. St. Stanislaus B.M. School opened in April, 1874. On August 10, 1882 groundbreaking took place and in 1883 the first level of the church was built. The founding Pastor was Dean Pitass and Rev. Dr. Alexander Pitass was the second Pastor of St. Stanislaus. The third pastor, Rt. Rev. Peter J. Adamski, founded an all-girls high school and was succeeded by the fourth pastor Rev. Msgr. Chester A. Meloch in 1974 who began construction of the Resurrection Mausoleum at the St. Stanislaus Cemetery. After Msgr. Meloch retired, he was succeeded by Msgr. Gabalski. During the current pastor's tenor, the Marian Mausoleum was constructed at the cemetery, a unit of the Knights of Columbus was established at the parish, the Outreach Center was opened, and the Msgr. Adamski Village with apartments for seniors and private homes became a reality. We wish St. Stanislaus the best in their 125th anniversary to be celebrated in 1998.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President. I rise today to congratulate the Columbia University School of Social Work on the occasion of the Centennial of the oldest social work training program in the nation. Evolving from a summer program organized by the Charity Organization Society in New York, the School of Social Work has a long and distinguished history of pioneering research, informed advocacy and exceptional professional training. 
Throughout the century, Columbia's faculty, students and alumni have worked tirelessly to address both the causes and symptoms of our most pressing social problems. National movements, such as the White House Conference on Children and the National Urban League, have emerged from projects undertaken by the school's faculty and administrators in cooperation with professional and community organizations. The entire nation has benefitted from the work of people like Eveline Burns who works in Social Security; Mitchell I. Ginsberg who works with the Head Start program; Richard Cloward who works with welfare rights and voter registration; Alfred Kahn and Sheila B. Kamerman who works with cross-national studies of social services; and David Fanshel who works with children in foster care. 
It is a remarkable accomplishment that social workers have played key roles in every major social reform movement, from settlement houses to labor reform, from the New Deal to civil rights and voter registration. Many of the things we take for granted today such as Social Security, child labor laws, minimum wage, the 40-hour work week, and even Medicare came into existence simply because social workers saw injustice. Social workers did not simply talk about the problem but thought up solutions to the problems and then implemented their ideas into reality. Social workers are inspirational not only in their actions but also in their courage. 
As Columbia University School of Social Work, and indeed the social work profession, move into their second centuries, they will be challenged to respond to social change, new social problems, family change, and evolving societal commitments. Now more than ever, we will need well-trained and dedicated social workers to conduct cutting-edge research, administer social programs, and alleviate society's most intractable problems. 
It is with appreciation and admiration that I extend my best wishes to Columbia University School of Social Work on its Centennial and look forward to its future activity and achievement.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Graham on this very important amendment. 
Senator Graham and I recently introduced S. 1682, the Innocent Spouse Tax Relief Act of 1998, to bring long overdue relief to innocent spouses, predominately women, who become responsible for the tax liabilities of their spouses merely because they happened to sign a joint return. 
I am pleased that the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee agrees that the current law innocent spouse provisions are weak at best, and needs dramatic change. I commend him for his leadership in making that change. 
There were concerns, and rightly so, that some taxpayers may try to abuse the innocent spouse rules by knowingly signing false returns, or transferring assets for the purpose of avoiding the payment of tax, and then claim to be innocent. Obviously, no one would want to open the door to that type of fraud. As such, language was included in the bill that would prevent an individual from electing the innocent spouse provision if they had `actual knowledge of any item giving rise to a deficiency.' 
However, this language raised concern for Senator Graham and myself because the IRS or the courts could deny relief to an innocent spouse simply because he or she had `actual knowledge' after the fact. 
Our amendment will correct what would have been an unintended consequence. It will clarify that the `actual knowledge' standard be based on knowledge of an item at the time the return was signed, and that it was not signed under duress. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment and provide relief to the 50,000 innocent spouses each year who are unfairly pursued by the IRS.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the reason I rise at this time is because certain matters have come to my attention and they are disturbing. Today, I have sent a letter to the President of the United States in regard to this. 
Mr. President, Israel is our closest ally, it is our most trusted friend among the nations of the Middle East. We have a long history of working together and supporting one another for the benefit of both nations and all of our people. 
Now as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Israel's independence, we should reaffirm our commitment to their peace and security and our support for their continuation as a strong, reliable, independent nation. 
I am proud of what Israel has accomplished over 50 years. I am proud of their commitment to freedom and justice. Israel should be praised for what it has accomplished and for doing so over a very long period of time in which it has faced terrorism from within and without its own borders. 
Israel has always fought its own battles. Its young have shed much blood to protect their freedom and they continue to this day to defend their right to exist. And their very right to exist is being threatened. Nations hostile to Israel throughout the region are a continuing threat to Israel's existence. And the Palestinian Authority to this day has yet to recognize Israel's legitimate right to exist. 
It is wrong for the Clinton administration to pressure Israel to forgo its own security needs at this critical time. It is just wrong. It is counterproductive. It is dangerous to a legitimate peace effort. The brave Israeli citizens who stand ready to defend their nation should be supported by us in every fashion. To place an ultimatum on Israel at this time undermines the peace process and it denies a good friend the right to determine its own security needs. It is not just bad policy; it is wrong. 
I urge President Clinton in the strongest terms to retract his ultimatum to Israel and to return America to our proper role as a friendly mediator in the search for peace and security for all nations in the Middle East. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I do not object, but I rise to make a point that I would hope it would be appropriate at this time to reserve the right, but I do not intend to object. 
I understand that oftentimes my colleagues work long and hard to craft legislation that they believe is in the best interests of their constituents and the people of this country, and that we do not always have the freedom and luxury for whatever the reason to offer such legislation. Indeed, I have been working with a number of my colleagues, Senator Feinstein and others, on a piece of legislation that I think is absolutely essential and should not be delayed; that every day it is delayed causes anguish for women throughout this country, for families without this country when they are denied basic treatment in terms of their medical needs. And I am talking about those who face cancer, breast cancer in particular, who are forced to leave a hospital because their insurance policy limits the length of stay and/or they are denied basic treatment, reconstructive surgery. And, indeed, just within the past 6 weeks we have had two cases that have come to my attention personally in my State, but it is happening throughout this country, where medical plans deny them these basic rights, the right to reconstructive surgery after a radical mastectomy. 
I have taken the time and impinged upon and imposed upon the time of the two leaders here because I feel strongly about this, because this is taking place. I believe it is an unwarranted and unintended consequence that brought this upon us, by passage of the ERISA law, which keeps States from putting on these reasonable conditions. It says, basically, a woman should be entitled to this kind of coverage. Unfortunately, there are some who say we should not have mandates. It is unfortunate that we might have to, and do have to, mandate in this case because there are millions and millions of American women who do not have this basic protection and right. 
I am fully intending to, and I said to my colleagues on the Finance Committee that I would, offer this legislative proposal that would see to it that this grievous situation is rectified. I intended to do it here on the IRS reform bill, because this is a bill that will pass. This is a bill that is necessary. This is a bill that my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, have worked on long and hard. And it will be signed into law. 
I also know that if we ever get an opportunity to bring the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act to this floor it will pass overwhelmingly. 
For a number of reasons we have not been able to do that. The two leaders have indicated to me, and have asked me to withhold, because there are other laudable, and I am sure very worthy, amendments that my colleagues have agreed not to put forth. They have assured me they will seek to give us an opportunity--Senator Feinstein and myself and the other 20 cosponsors--to bring up this amendment. It is not a costly amendment but will save lives. It will save families. It will ensure that women get the proper kind of care they can and should be getting. It is unfortunate that we need this kind of legislation. They will attempt to give us an opportunity of some 2 hours this Tuesday to bring forth this legislation. 
On that basis, I will not object. But I have to tell my colleagues, it is a year and a half now. There is a lot of pain. A lot of people have been denied that which they should have had. A lot of people have been forced to go to appeals, to appeal through the boards that administer many of these programs, their self-insured programs, to get this basic right. I don't think that we want to, nor should we, continue this nor countenance this any longer. 
On the assurance that we are going to attempt and really make a good-faith effort to bring this to the floor Tuesday, I will withdraw any objection and go along. I thank my colleagues for recognizing the plight of families in America in attempting to work with us in a way that collectively we can solve that problem. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Good, because I will wait for something all my colleagues want, and we may be here a long time. I don't think that is going to serve anybody's interest. I would like everyone to join in. If they can make this bill a better bill truly in that spirit, then let's do it. If it is just to weight it down and sink it, that is not something I am going to take as being responsible, and we will talk to that. 
Everybody has a right to do what they want out here in the open. People can judge whether they are being responsible or not. I hope in that spirit, because we have done a lot of good things together, I remind my colleagues on both sides, it is in that spirit I would like to approach it. I thank the majority leader for understanding and the minority leader. I look forward to working with them both.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today as we reach the end of our debate on NATO enlargement to restate my firm support for the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty providing for the accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. NATO enlargement is the right thing to do. We must seize this opportunity now to help make Europe whole and free. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of enlargement. 
While NATO was born out of the Cold War to protect ourselves and our allies from the Soviet threat, it is also part of the broader U.S. policy to foster European integration after the end of World War II. The first step in this policy was the Marshall Plan, not NATO. But after Stalin's Iron Curtain divided Europe, and Soviet-installed puppet governments rejected Marshall Plan aid, it was clear that economic recovery and political cooperation could not proceed without a security shield. NATO provided that shield. 
The Soviet Union is gone. So are the Moscow-controlled puppet governments in central and eastern European states. Once again, we have a window of opportunity to complete the work we started at the end of World War II. We must not miss this historic chance to advance our policy of supporting European integration based on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. 
We have a chance to bring into the circle of Western democracies those states, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, that were denied this chance by Soviet occupation at the end of World War II. By voting for enlargement, we are again extending the hand that Stalin slapped away, affirming the promise of freedom and security for the Polish, Hungarian, and Czech peoples. 
As Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, better known as the Helsinki Commission, I have seen NATO candidate states take steps to resolve internal problems and external disputes that have been major features of national life within those states for generations. Human rights violations in those states have substantially decreased, and their membership in NATO and, in the future, the EU, will give us leverage to resolve remaining problems. But for the promise of the security guarantee that comes with NATO membership, I believe these problems and disputes would not only have remained unresolved, but would likely have given rise, over time, to confrontations between states that could have led to war. 
Thus, by that measure, NATO enlargement is already having positive results. 
Once NATO enlargement is realized, the political risk associated with economic reform in central and eastern European states will diminsh. This will make international investors more willing to provide capital to businesses in these states, creating jobs and improving economic health. Improved performance during and after transition to free market economies will help cement in place stable democratic governments. 
The combination of healthy economies and stable democratic governments will help the European Union expand to include these states. Thus, expansion of NATO's security shield is the first step, not the last step, toward further broad European integration. 
There have been many statements of caution about the impact of NATO enlargement on Russia. I firmly believe that Russian democracy will be better served by having healthy, stable, and prosperous democracies on its western border, than by leaving a gray zone between a steadily more integrated Europe and Russia. 
Since coming to the Senate in 1981, I have been a member of the Helsinki Commission. This work has brought me into contact with the Soviet dissident community, which over time has become the core of the Russian pro-reform and pro-democracy movement. From this long experience, I can tell you that a failure to expand NATO and the European Union to embrace every European state that can meet the established entrance requirements would be a victory for the anti-democratic forces in Russia. 
Especially if NATO enlargement were to fail because the United States would not agree to it, extremist politicians of all stripes from Russia through eastern and central Europe would take heart and encouragement. Democrats and free market reformers would be seriously damaged, and political and economic stability would be called into question. The influence of the United States would be greatly decreased, and our commitments would be open to doubt. When we cast our votes today, we need to keep in mind the probable highly negative consequences of what would, in effect, be a veto by the United States Senate of NATO expansion. 
NATO enlargement, European integration, and the advancement of political reform, democracy, individual freedom, and free market economics are all part of the same effort. What we do here today can make a major contribution to the security and prosperity of future generations of Americans. 
The opportunity to expand the circle of free and democratic countries can not be missed. This amendment to the North Atlantic Treaty should be approved. I will vote for it, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bi-partisan legislation which will allow states the option of providing Medicaid coverage to women who have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the federal government's breast and cervical cancer early detection program. 
Currently, the CDC breast and cervical cancer program provides low-income, uninsured women with coverage for cancer screening, covering mammographies and pap smears. While this program begins to fill a crucial need, this legislation allows Congress to make this program even better. The result has often been that uninsured women are diagnosed with cancer and then left to scramble to find treatment. 
In 1990 Congress passed a bill that was a breakthrough for the early detection of breast and cervical cancer in women. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 authorized the Center for Disease control to increase screening services for women who are low-income. From July of 1991 to March of 1997, CDC's program provide mammography screening to over 500,000 women and diagnosed nearly 3,500 cases of breast cancer. During this same period, the program provided over 700,000 Pap tests and found more than 300 cases of invasive cervical cancer. This is good news for the early detection of cancers in women. 
But the bad news is that all women are not getting treated for cancer. Screening does not prevent cancer deaths; it must be coupled with treatment. Congress tried to ensure that women would get treatment, by requiring that state programs seek out services for the women they screen. But wherever I've traveled in New York, I've been hearing reports that programs are over burdened. Volunteers are working over time. Program administrators are having to rely on public hospitals and charity care. Women are having to hold bake sales to get treatment. This is wrong. It's not what Congress intended when it passed the Cancer Prevention Act in 1990. 
Now, a newly published study of the program documents that approaches for delivering treatment services are fragmented, and in danger of breaking down. I am very concerned, Mr. President, that the program is over burdened and needs help. The women of America need this program. Early detection saves lives. However, Mr. President, if we are unable to treat the women who are diagnosed with breast cancer, we have failed them. 
I commend the local programs that are working hard to line up treatment services for women. These programs are doing whatever they can to see that women with cancer get care. But the fact is that these solutions are labor-intensive and have long-range consequences of the program itself. The CDC study shows that programs are having a hard time recruiting new providers and must limit the number of women screened. Today the program serves only 12 to 15% of all women who are eligible nationally. And this percentage is likely to decrease. The study also shows 
that fewer physicians will be able to offer free or reduced-fee services in the future, because of changes in the health-care system. My point is, and the study shows, that whatever fragile delivery systems for treatment are in place now are in jeopardy and overburdened. Women are not getting the treatment they need. 
In June 1997, Senator Moynihan and I were successful in including an amendment in the Budget Resolution that addressed this and would have solved this problem. Unfortunately, that amendment was passed by the Senate but later died in conference. Mr. President, we must not let these women fall through the cracks any longer. This legislation provides a mechanism to fix the problem that these under served women face. 
Mr. President, I began the fight in 1992 for more research funding for breast cancer. With the help of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and the women of New York--women like Barbara Balaban, Geri Barish, and Doctor Susan Love, Senator Harkin and I started a research program in the Army that has grown to over $750 million and continues to provide research dollars for the latest, cutting edge technologies and research. 
We must not abandon the women of America who are diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer, only to find that there is no way to pay for their treatment. Congress has responded to the call for more research money for breast cancer, we must now continue that fight to provide increased treatment for every woman diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. 
The National Breast Cancer Coalition has made me very aware of the problems that women are facing regarding treatment after diagnosis under the CDC program. And I am concerned that the problem is getting worse. 
We make speeches and wear pink ribbons to show our commitment to fight breast cancer--but now is the time to act to support a simple amendment that will make real contribution to the fight against breast cancer. It will save lives and ensure that women, when diagnosed through the federal program, will not have to hold bake sales to get treatment. 
I join my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, Senator Snowe, and Senator Mikulski, in sponsoring legislation that will establish a mechanism for women's treatment. This is a targeted measure that will allow states the option of providing Medicaid to women who have participated in the CDC program and have been diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. I am determined to solve this problem before Congress is adjourned this year. It is irresponsible of the federal government to do otherwise.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Federal Home Loan Bank System Restructuring Act of 1998' to eliminate the last vestiges of a bureaucratic structure which contributed to the downfall of the savings and loan industry in the 1980's, and cost American taxpayers $125 billion. I am referring to the structural weakness inherent in a regulatory system which allows the combination of basic safety and soundness oversight with management and governance functions. This structural weakness exists today in the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) which oversees the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Moreover, the FHFB appears to be the only regulatory agency where the responsibility for safety and soundness regulation has not been separated from management and governance functions. 
I am very pleased that Senator Richard Shelby has joined as a co-sponsor because he is the Senate's leading proponent of regulatory reform and eliminating outdated and unnecessary regulation. 
Mr. President, throughout most of its history, the Federal Home Loan Bank System was regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the same agency responsible for regulating the thrift industry. In 1989, Congress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to abolish the Bank Board and create the Federal Housing Finance Board (`FHFB') to assume responsibility for the regulation and supervision of the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB System). FIRREA provided the FHFB with the authority to supervise the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks), ensure that the FHLBanks carry out their mission of housing finance, ensure the FHLBanks remain adequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets, and ensure the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner. 
Safety and soundness regulation became the primary duty of the FHFB as a result of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. In that Act, Congress also recognized problems at the Federal Housing Finance Board and specifically identified this structural flaw as a serious problem. In search of a solution to this problem and information concerning the future of the Federal Home Loan Banks in the context of changing markets for housing finance, Congress mandated several studies. In the study conducted by the FHFB, the agency itself expressed concern about its dual role: `The roles of regulation and governance residing in one entity are not compatible and, indeed, represent a long standing, well-understood inherent conflict when joined'. [The Report on the Structure and Role of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, The Federal Housing Finance Board, submitted to Congress on April 28, 1993, page 153.] The FHFB recognized that concerns about shareholder dividends and profitability should not be in competition with concerns over safety and soundness and the availability of housing finance for American taxpayers. 
Mr. President, this bill would eliminate this serious and dangerous conflict by transferring functions from the FHFB to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This is the current system of regulation designed by Congress for the other two housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs)--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
In addition, consolidating safety and soundness regulation in one regulatory is consistent with the core recommendations of GAO and HUD--that the conflict with the FHFB be resolved through the creation of a single housing-related GSE. Even the Chairman of the FHFB, in testimony before a House Banking Subcommittee last July, endorsed the GAO's recommendation for a single independent safety and soundness regulator for the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He acknowledged that consolidation will yield more effective regulation. 
Mr. President, consolidating regulation of the housing GSE's is also consistent with the Administration's objective of reducing government by eliminating unnecessary, duplicative or redundant regulation--an objective we all share. By placing FHFB's safety and soundness functions with 
OFHEO, administration costs would be cut and regulatory consistencies would be realized as a result of the complementary nature of the housing finance roles played by the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Another important public benefit of consolidating oversight of the housing missions of these agencies within HUD is to enable HUD to more effectively assess and respond to the nation's affordable housing needs. 
Mr. President, the legislation would abolish the conflicting dual roles of the FHFB, streamline an overburdened bureaucratic process, and insure that those entities with the mission of promoting housing finance--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks--are meeting that challenge in the most effective way possible. We owe nothing less to the working families most in need of our assistance than to insure the system is working for them. 
Mr. President, this bill would address the regulation of the Federal Home Loan Bank System by transferring its safety and soundness functions to OFHEO and mission oversight to HUD. It does not--and is not intended to--address other policy issues pertaining to the future role of the Federal Home Loan Banks which remain under consideration by the Banking Committee, Improving the level of affordable housing, ensuring effective, efficient and objective regulation, cutting the fat out of the government, and managing the taxpayers' dollars wisely--that is what this bill is all about.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, April 24th is the day we remember the horrors inflicted upon the Armenians in Turkey during World War I and afterward. Today, we express our solidarity with Armenians everywhere, and reflect upon the meaning of their suffering and sacrifice. We mourn the dead, and express our condolences to their living descendants. During that terrible tragedy, about 1.5 million people were killed. 
The massacres and deportations of the Armenians during that period were a forerunner of subsequent horrors perpetrated against other peoples. The Armenians were the first victims of genocide in this century, when civilian populations, defined by ethnicity, race or religion, have been targeted by soldiers or paramilitary groups, and in some cases, by sovereign states using all their instruments of military power to destroy a people. 
We mark this day so as never to forget what happened, and to strengthen our conviction to prevent any recurrences in the future. Not only against Armenians, but against any people. 
During and after World War I, Armenians did not have a state of their own. Today, independent Armenia defends Armenians everywhere, and they, in turn, protect the interests of their ancient homeland. Armenia is a country of great promise, despite its many troubles. We fervently hope that the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Minsk Group will be successful and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict will be resolved peacefully. We pray that we may see a prosperous Armenia living in peace with all its neighbors, continuing to teach the world lessons, as a light unto the nations.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that will benefit consumers and small businessmen and women who must travel by air. The bill I am introducing today, the Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998, will reverse an increasingly anti-consumer, anti-competitive trend in airline travel across the country. 
For three years, the major airlines have been moving to gain more control over the airline travel ticket distribution system. While this effort may seem harmless, the ramifications to consumers are significant. Currently, most air travelers get their information from one of the 33,000 travel agencies around the country. These agencies provide consumers with unbiased and comprehensive air travel information, i.e., the best flight at the cheapest fare. Without that independent source of travel information, there is no doubt that consumers will be paying more, in many cases, substantially more for air travel. 
The Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998 is a reasonable, and balanced bill that is significant not only for what it does, but also for what it doesn't do. This legislation would simply require the Secretary of Transportation to investigate the behavior of major airlines, including discriminatory and predatory practices of airlines which target travel agents, other independent distributors, and small airlines. This is authority that the Secretary currently has under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, but has thus far not elected to use. This bill makes certain this investigation is undertaken. If it is determined that anti-competitive, discriminatory or predatory practices exist, the Secretary must report to Congress those steps the Department intends to take to address such practices. 
What this legislation does not do is regulate the airline industry. In fact, this legislation is a wake up call for the industry. As the for-profit hospital and HMO industries discovered, if consumers are disregarded, and anti-competitive activities are encouraged, the heavy hand of regulators and anti-trust remedies will soon follow. This investigation by DOT may bring to light practices that the airlines themselves may not even realize exist. It is far better to have DOT look into these issues and have them addressed now, than to have Congress begin pursuing more proactive legislative remedies in the future. 
Travel agents provide critical services to air travelers, and air travelers depend heavily upon travel agents to provide an accurate, broad selection of schedules, fare quotes, and ticketing services for all airlines. Agents quote schedules and fares, and provide ticketing services, to consumers on major U.S. airlines, small U.S. airlines, large and small international airlines, and start-up airlines. 
The travel agency community and other independent ticket distributors are the only efficient, independent and comprehensive sources of information for airline travel options. Travel agencies and other independent distributors comprise a considerable portion of the small business sector in the United States, employing over 250,000 people. Over 50% of travel agencies are owned by women or minorities. 
Every industry study conducted since the 1960's has concluded that travel agents can process reservation and ticketing transactions in any medium more efficiently than can airlines. Just this year, one of the world's largest and most efficient airlines announced the closing of all of its U.S. ticket offices in favor of the efficiencies of the U.S. travel agency industry. 
So why are multi-billion dollar airlines putting the squeeze on the mom and pop travel agencies? Unfortunately, the answer lies beyond just sucking more revenue from the travel agent. The biggest threat to the current airline oligopoly is the young, upstart airlines. Wherever these airlines operate, the major air carriers' prices are competitive. Wherever these airlines do not operate, the consumer pays monopoly prices. Small domestic airlines, many international airlines, and start-up airlines heavily depend upon the travel agency distribution system. There is no alternate distribution system available to these types of airlines. A less ubiquitous, less independent travel agency means less business for, and less competition from, the smaller airlines. 
As part of the effort to consolidate their market power, the airlines began to focus on the ticket distribution system. Twice in the last three years, the major airlines have initiated and supported reductions in travel agent commissions on the sale of air travel. In February alone, total travel agent commissions on domestic travel dropped 21%. More reductions from airlines, and greater travel agent losses, are expected. The number of travel agencies has decreased for the first time since World War II, and many more closings are expected as agency operating reserves are exhausted. 
As travel agents are forced out of the industry and airlines secure more direct consumer business, consumer alternatives will continue to decrease, resulting in significantly higher consumer travel costs. Major airlines have generally misrepresented the reason for agency commission cuts, citing a need to reduce expenses and pass savings on to consumers. In fact, airline ticket prices have steadily increased, there have been no consumer benefits, airlines are posting record profits quarter-after-quarter, and consumers are paying the highest airfares in history. 
Commissions are not the only way in which the airlines are using anti-competitive practices to pressure the travel agents. For example, confidential business information generated by travel agents, such as marketing, bookings, and sales data, is routinely shared by the airlines. 
Considering airlines regard themselves as competitors of travel agents, this is an intolerable situation for the travel agents. 
Another example of unfair treatment is the use of promotions, concessions, and benefits that airlines can pass on to consumers that are denied to travel agents. In addition the airlines operate the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), which controls both who can become a travel agent and the settlement of funds between travel agents and the airlines. 
Internet travel servicing, one ticket distribution alternative which holds great promise for consumers, is also being dominated by the major air carriers. As a practical matter, travel agents have already been excluded by airlines from selling tickets booked by electronic means. As with conventional distribution, Internet consumers have very limited ability to view consolidated electronic schedule and fare information, much less interpret the rules, restrictions and penalties attached to such lower fares as might be found. 
That is why, Mr. President, Congress must pass the Consumer Access to Travel Information Act of 1998 before consumers are hurt further, and before there is an overwhelming cry to reregulate air travel.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me simply say that the objective of these reforms is to put our children first, to promote excellence in education, to reward the truly outstanding teachers who create magic in the classroom, give them merit pay, and see to it that we have a level of competence in terms of teaching what our children require. 
Mr. President, let me say that we do not mandate that States and local districts come into this with the funds that will be provided for merit pay and teacher testing.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, in about half an hour or 45 minutes I will have the pleasure of being able to offer an amendment to the pending bill, along with my friend and colleague, Senator Mack of Florida, that will, I believe, help reform education. I believe the most important battle that America faces is to provide an opportunity for our youngsters to get a decent education, to get the best education possible. 
Reform of our education system is one of America's priorities. Indeed, our amendment will reform the evaluation of public school teachers in America and, most importantly, will reward the best teachers with additional salary. 
Reforming our education system is the most important issue facing our Nation. This is a fight for America's children. When we look at reforming our public schools, one thing must always be kept foremost in our efforts: We must put our children first--not anyone's interest, but the interest of our children. Our children are the best and the brightest. They are our most precious resource. That is what our legislative proposal will be about. 
This amendment is about promoting excellence in teaching, for the benefit of our children. Before I get into the details of the amendment, I want to speak a little bit about excellent teachers and how they help our children learn. 
When my dad entered elementary school quite a few years ago, he didn't speak a word of English. Indeed, very few spoke English in the poor, immigrant community in which he grew up. But he had teachers who were dedicated to giving the best education to those children who came from all kinds of diverse backgrounds. After many years of hard work, summer schools included, my dad graduated. He went on to a State teachers' college where he majored, of all things, in English. My dad was able to achieve this amazing progress because he was inspired by his public school teachers who created magic in the classroom. 
That same inspiration takes place today in many classrooms throughout America. Public school teachers still make a difference for millions of our children. Truly outstanding teachers are the unsung heroes of our communities. 
Unfortunately, however, this magic does not take place for every child in every classroom, and that is a tragedy. 
Today, in most of our Nation's public schools, there is no financial incentive for those truly outstanding teachers. We should change that. Outstanding teachers who help our children achieve educational success should be rewarded with merit pay. That is just good common sense. It works in business. It works in other areas. And it should be part of our educational system. 
Another commonsense measure is teacher competence testing. Again, most teachers are very dedicated, and most teachers are up to the job. But some are not. In some cases, you have teachers who are competent in their area of specialty who are teaching other subjects in which they lack competence. When that happens, our children are the ones who suffer. We need to know that those who teach our children are competent in the subjects they teach. We need competency testing for all teachers. Our children deserve nothing less than the best. 
Our legislation will provide incentives for States and localities to adopt both of these vital measures: merit pay and competency testing. The amendment is called `Measures to Encourage Results in Teaching.' It is the MERIT Act. 
Incentives are provided through the Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The amendment sets aside 50 percent of the funds appropriated over fiscal year 1999 levels and then distributes it to States that have established teacher testing and merit pay plans. 
Last year, fiscal year 1998, Congress appropriated $335 million for this program to subsidize training for teachers, an increase of $25 million from the year before. I support this effort to train teachers. But I also believe that we have to be able to ensure that teachers are actually improving their teaching skills and children are benefiting. Teacher testing will accomplish this goal. I also want to reward teachers whose training creates magic in the classroom. Merit pay will accomplish this goal. 
Under this amendment, as the Eisenhower Professional Development Program funding increases, so will each State and local Government's share. However, 50 percent of the increase will be reserved for those States that put in place merit pay and teacher testing. 
Mr. President, it is time to meet the challenges of massive, fundamental reform in education. Congress has repeatedly tried to address the inadequacies in our schools by providing funding. I support more funding for education. But we also have to recognize that funding alone will not make American schools competitive in the global economy. There needs to be significant reforms--and merit pay and teacher testing should be part of those reforms. 
The fight to reform our public education system is a fight for America's future. Our children are depending on us. 
I urge my colleagues to support this measure, to guarantee that all students have the right to be taught by educated, confidence and qualified teachers--and to reward the truly outstanding teachers with merit pay, those teachers who do create magic in the classroom. 
Let's not let the status quo diminish the dream of our parents and grandparents. The American people know the importance of this fight. The fight to reform our public schools is a fight for America's future. Our children are depending on us. And I know that if we once again give our children the best teachers and the best schools, there is no limit to what they can achieve.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I want to commend my friend and colleague, Senator Mack, for his work in this area. Indeed, he just did not sit behind a desk and dream up a theory; he went out to see; he went out to see that there are programs that do work. And reforming our education system is the most important issue facing this Nation. 
I think the parents and grandparents know that the public education system can do better. This is a fight for our children, and I think what we should be focusing on is putting the interests of our children first. That is the question. And we should not let the status quo diminish the dream of our parents and our grandparents. The American people know the importance of this fight. 
The fight to reform our public schools is a fight for our future. And why shouldn't we say the best and the brightest teachers--those who make magic in the classroom; those who make a difference--should be rewarded with merit pay? There are some who are opposed to this. Well, I have to tell you, we cannot pay teachers enough, those great and gifted teachers. This is one way to realize and to give them that kind of recognition that they are entitled to. 
Secondly, a provision of this amendment that is most important says we need teacher competency testing. Indeed, we see all too often where teachers are moved into areas that they do not have the excellence and the competence to teach. A great English teacher, for example, being moved into an area of science or mathematics may not be up to that particular job. That is why we say--and, by the way, we do not impose this; this is something that States can opt into. We do not believe in big brother Government coming in and saying, `This is the standard that you have to use for determining a competence.' That is up to the State and the local districts to develop the standards for competency testing. 
But in all sectors of life there are levels of competence that are expected. Indeed, when it comes to the most important area, that of educating our children, should we do any less? I do not think so. In all areas of life, in terms of competition, including the business world, there is merit pay. We hear about stock options for the successful entrepreneur. In corporate America, we hear of bonuses for achieving certain levels. 
Why should we not do the same? Bring those areas of the private sector into public education that work for the benefit of our children. And if we have truly outstanding and dedicated teachers, then why not reward them? Why not merit pay? Indeed, the teachers that make magic in our classrooms are sorely needed. It is about time we began to recognize their efforts. They are truly extraordinary. 
I believe that when we look at many of the educational institutions today, particularly in our inner cities, we see distress, we see a system that needs the kinds of reforms that this bill will begin to bring into the system. And so while it is not a cure-all, I believe it is a powerful step forward to giving our children the opportunity they deserve. 
I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment and urge my colleagues to be open minded about it. Do not permit the special interest groups to put the kind of pressure that will have them voting against the interests of our children. It is about time we put the interests of our children first. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to Ms. Florence Kirkner. Today, we focus on Ms. Kirkner's 50 years of volunteering with the National Ski Patrol. The National Ski Patrol was formed 60 years ago as a volunteer organization that has been granted a Congressional Charter as a charity similar to the Boys and Girls Scouts. This organization formed an army division that could fight in winter weather conditions during World War II. Additionally, Senator Bob Dole was affiliated with this division which is known as the Tenth Mountain Division. This division was the only civilian run division in the Army's history. Today, the Tenth Mountain division is stationed at Fort Drum, New York. 
I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Ms. Kirkner's participation in many other community activities such as the American Red Cross, the Girl Scouts and the YMCA. 
After reviewing Ms. Kirkner's outstanding achievements, I decided an acknowledgment of her awards should be presented. Ms. Kirkner received a Citizen of the Week Award in 1996 and in 1997 she received the Citizen of the Year Award. Previously, because of Ms. Kirkner's excellent community service, she received the Merit Award in 1985 and the Volunteer of the year award in 1986. Ms. Kirkner was twice nominated for the Clara Barton Award in 1988 and again in 1990. Additionally in 1988, the Volunteer of the Year Award was acclaimed to Ms. Kirkner. Furthermore, after serving over 15,000 hours of community service, Ms. Kirkner was presented with the Service Award in addition to the 50 Year Service Award. 
Ms. Kirkner has also received awards for the National Appointment #84, the Outstanding Service Award for the North Bay Region, the Patroller of the Year Award for the Western New York Region, 2 Yellow Merit Stars, the Purple Merit Star, the Avalanche Patch #82, the Eastern Division Certificate of Appreciation, the Red Cross Certificate of Merit, the Certificate of Appreciation for the Western New York Region, the Ambassador of the Slopes Award for the Western New York Region, the Mike Reid Outstanding Instructor Award for the Western New York Region, the Canadian Ski Patrol Special Award and the Green Angel Award from the Girl Scouts. 
I would also like to acknowledge Ms. Kirkner for holding numerous offices in her lifetime. She has held offices such as Co-Patrol Leader for Donner Ski Ranch; Regional Training Officer for Western New York; Regional First Aid Chairman in North Bay, California; Avalanche Instructor for National #224; ARC First Aid Instructor and Trainer; ARC CPR Instructor and Trainer; ARC Water Safety Instructor and Trainer; ARC Small Craft Safety Instructor and Shift Leader at Kissing Bridge Ski Patrol. 
In addition Ms. Kirkner has managed to conduct training courses and workshops such as the Avalanche Patch Course in Slide Mt., Nevada; Sled Handling Seminars in Squaw Valley, California; the Mountain Rescue Course at the Sugar Bowl; Mountaineering at Circle M; Divisional Jr. Training Seminars for 11 years and National Jr. Training Seminars for 4 years. Moreover, Ms. Kirkner led Fall Forums workshops too numerous to count from New York City to Sacramento, from Portland, to Maine and has been an instructor every year of Patrol CPR since the beginning of Ski Patrol, CPR. 
Ms. Kirkner is truly one of those unique individuals who has given a lifetime of community service. Her contributions to society will always be recognized as encouragement and hope to American citizens everywhere, and reminds us that the phrase `it is better to give than to receive' still rings to be true.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, on April 11, 1923, nearly seventy-five years ago, Adolph Koeppel was born in Brooklyn, New York. 
He attended PS92 and New Utrecht High School. He went on to attend Brooklyn College for two years; but his studies were interrupted by the advent of World War II. 
Mr. Koeppel served America with great distinction in the Navy from 1942 to 1945, where the ship on which he served, the USS Barton, came under attack at Okinawa and the Philippines. 
Following his wartime military service, Mr. Koeppel attended New York University Law School, where he completed his LLB in 1948 and received an LLM in 1953. He has achieved great heights in the legal community, and to this day remains a true pioneer in the fields of condemnation and real estate tax appeals. 
In addition, Mr. Koeppel is known for his achievements as a philatelist, having been awarded the Earl of Crawford Medal by the Royal Philatelic Society. 
On April 11, he will celebrate his 75th birthday along with his wife of 54 years, Rhoda, his daughters Pamela and Leslie, and his granddaughters Melissa, Jennifer, and Tara. 
Beyond all of his personal and professional achievements, Adolph Koeppel is a great humanitarian and community servant. I am proud to call him my friend, mentor, and counselor; and I am pleased to wish him a very happy 75th birthday. The people of New York are blessed to have him in our community.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, 
last year, the Congress delivered some long-overdue and much-deserved tax relief to the American people. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 provided the first middle-class tax cut in 16 years. 
The tax cuts we passed last year are making a difference in the monthly budgets of working middle-class families. But we can and we must do more. These families still send too much of their hard-earned money to Washington. And between federal, state, and local taxes, the average American's tax bill is nearly 35 percent of their total income. In fact, most Americans spend more time working to pay their tax bills than they spend working to provide food, clothing, and shelter combined. We absolutely must continue our efforts to reduce the tax burden. 
One area that escaped our tax-cutting efforts last year was the enormous property tax bills paid by homeowners. Last year, hardworking Americans paid about $209 billion in real-estate property taxes. This was more than one-and-one-half times what individuals paid in state income taxes. 
In addition, property tax rates have increased almost twice as fast as inflation. Property taxes are spiraling out of control, and the time has come to give homeowners some real relief. 
Homeownership is the American dream, but that dream now comes with a tax bill that puts a heavy burden on working families. This property tax bill also provides a disincentive to any young couple considering purchasing a home. We in Washington should change that equation--we should be doing everything we can to encourage and assist homeownership. 
Today, I am introducing the `Working Middle-Class Tax Relief Act of 1998.' This bill will allow homeowners to take a federal tax credit for the first $500 of property taxes paid on their personal residence. The Working Middle Class Tax Relief Act will provide real help to working families who are struggling to make ends meet, and it will send a strong message that homeownership can become a reality for all Americans. 
Here are a few examples of how my bill works. Under current law, there are nearly 36 million taxpayers who do not get any savings on property taxes because they don't file an itemized federal tax return. Under my bill, every dollar of property tax that they pay, up to $500, will come back to them in the form of federal tax savings. 
Of course, millions of other Americans do itemize. Take, for example, a typical family of four with a taxable income of $42,000, and a property tax bill of $3,000. Under current law they receive a $450 federal tax benefit. By turning the first $500 of property taxes into a tax credit, my legislation would give this typical family an additional $425 savings, for a total tax benefit of $875. 
This savings to homeowners could cut their property tax bill by one-third or more, and in some cases wipe it out all together. This legislation will let working families keep more of their money. That's the way it should be. After all, the American people know how to manage their own money much better than Washington does. 
The Working Middle-Class Tax Relief Act is real savings for the 66 million Americans who have realized the dream of owning a home, and it will help millions more achieve that dream.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the current financial crisis in Asia underscores the need for open, competitive markets, free from manipulation. Clearly, industrial policy does not work. Managed trade and managed commerce is a failure. It simply does not work. Mr. President, we have said it all along--when you manipulate trade and erect barriers to open and free trade, the consumer gets hurt. 
Mr. President, today we are submitting a resolution which is aimed at forcing Japan to put their money where their mouth is. This Resolution makes it clear that Japan must fulfill its publicly stated commitments to open its markets for photographic film and paper, and other sectors facing market access barriers. The bureaucrats in Japan should be on notice that the U.S. Congress will not tolerate their intervention into the free market. The United States maintains free and open markets in every sector of the economy. Americans should expect nothing less of any of our trading partners. 
Plain and simple, Mr. President, the Japanese Government has allowed Fuji to use Japan's lax anti-trust laws and closed-market system to erect barriers to free and open competition. The Japanese government, however, maintains that this is not true and that their markets are open and free. This Resolution will simply encourage the Japanese government to demonstrate their openness. 
The Government of Japan has said publicly that they did not build, support, and tolerate a market structure that thwarts foreign competition, and in which exclusionary business practices are commonplace. This Resolution simply allows the Japanese government to demonstrate their resolve to open, free and fair trade.

Mr. DAMATO. Two years ago today, the Nation's two largest electronic banking networks, Plus and Cirrus, better known as MasterCard and VISA, lifted their longstanding ban on the practice of double charging ATM users. They had a ban; it was not permitted. 
Now, since that fateful April Fool's Day in 1996, the joke has been on the consumers, and it has been a costly joke. They have had to shell out billions of dollars just to take their own money out of the bank. 
Today, I hold up a report `Big Banks, Bigger ATM Fees' from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. In that report they indicate that double chargers in 28 States and the District of Columbia have shown that 71 percent of all banks today are double charging consumers for the privilege of getting their own money out. That percentage is more than twice the number reported by the General Accounting Office in May of 1997. So, more and more people have less and less opportunity to be able to withdraw their money without that double charge. 
Going further, it says the price of the average double charging has also risen to $1.23. Keep in mind this charge is on top of a fee that the consumer already pays to his or her own bank. The survey found that 83 percent of the banks charged their own customer an average of $1.18 per transaction whenever they use another ATM. So that means a consumer pays $2.41, on average, every time they use an ATM that does not belong to their own bank. 
So what we have, if a person uses an ATM six times a month --a relatively small utilization--they can be paying an average of $173 a year more. What an April Fool's joke on the people of America. 
This situation is not going to get better; it is going to get worse. What a windfall for the large banks who are now making profits of over $3 billion a year by charging people twice to get their own money. 
I am not going to say more about this except to say we will be voting on this issue. Make no mistake about it, we will be voting. When that amendment comes to the floor--and I will pick what I consider to be legislation that must be acted on--there will be hoots and hollers, why on this bill? But make no mistake about it, the people are entitled to know where their representatives stand with respect to this issue. 
To date we have 10 cosponsors, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. I know the power and the pressure of those who oppose this, but I think it is about time we began to look at the little guy, and I'm talking about the American taxpayer.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Moseley-Braun, Shelby, Faircloth, Bennett, Hagel, Sarbanes, Dodd, Kerry, Bryan, Boxer, Reed and DeWine to introduce the U.S. Holocaust Assets Commission Act of 1998. This legislation will create the `Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States,' that will examine the disposition of assets of Holocaust victims, survivors, and heirs here in the United States. 
For two years now, I have worked closely with Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat who has labored tirelessly to close this difficult chapter of history in an honorable, speedy, and satisfactory manner. He cares passionately that the survivors receive justice and I could not agree more. I am pleased to say that the Administration fully supports this legislation and we have worked with them closely over the past four months to craft the language to bring this commission to reality. 
While we have sought answers from Switzerland and other nations on the disposition of dormant bank accounts and Nazi gold, we have not pursued the issue here in the United States. Today, we begin this search. Now we are obliged to set history straight and correct any injustices in our own country. The United States has a moral responsibility to address the same issues to which we have sought answers from Switzerland and other nations in Europe. The spirit of American decency demands no less. 
If we are to provide long overdue justice to Holocaust survivors and the heirs of the victims, we must do so as expeditiously as possible. Time is of the essence if we are going to provide the necessary restitution to this already aged and rapidly dwindling survivor community. Moreover, by creating this commission we establish even greater moral authority and diplomatic credibility with other nations from which we seek answers on these important questions. Thus far, twelve nations have already set up national commissions to look into these issues. 
With this legislation we will create a commisison that will seek to find the disposition of the following assets in this country: dormant bank accounts of Holocaust victims in U.S. banks; brokerage accounts, securities, & bonds; artwork & religious/cultural artifacts; German-looted gold shipped to the U.S. through the Tripartite Gold Commission; and insurance policies. 
As far as funding is concerned, the Commission will be funded for $3.5 million, with the costs split by the interested agencies of the U.S. Government. The Commission will operate through December 31, 1999, the date its final report is due to the President. 
The Commission will comprise members appointed by both the Congress and the President, as well as private citizens who have demonstrated their leadership on issues relating to the financial community, public service, and the history of the Holocaust. 
Mr. President, we need this Commission. We must leave no stone unturned. If we are to fully examine the disposition of the assets of the victims of the Holocaust, we cannot ignore what happened in this country. While it is not within our power to change what happened during WWII, it is within our power to correct a historic wrong by providing answers to questions that have remained unanswered for over fifty years. If we do at least this much now, then we will provide a measure of comfort and justice for the survivors of the greatest evil mankind has ever known. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this legislation and I urge its speedy passage.

Mr. DAMATO. 
 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleagues, Senators Rockefeller, Hutchison, Feinstein and Boxer, to create a new tax credit that will make it easier for medical schools, teaching hospitals, and non-for-profit research hospitals to invest in potentially life saving medical research. Our bill will add Section 41A to the Internal Revenue Code to establish a Medical Innovation Tax Credit. This new credit would apply to qualified medical innovation expenses for biopharmaceutical research activities, including clinical trials, at qualified academic institutions. The credit rate would be 20% of qualified expenses on research conducted in the United States. This tax incentive is necessary in order to assure that the United States maintains its position as the leading country for biomedical research. 
The Medical Innovation Tax Credit will supplement the current law Research and Experimental Tax Credit (R&E) which has allowed biopharmaceutical companies to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in research for new drug therapies. Clinical trials are conducted by these drug companies in order to obtain FDA approval. However, these initial studies are only a fraction of the applied research needed to follow patients and to discover possible combinations of drugs which provide the most effective therapy. These post-approval studies are performed by clinical investigators and major academic medical centers. 
Until recently, medical schools, teaching hospitals, and not-for-profit hospitals were able to fund research from their operating profits. Many physicians chose to practice at these hospitals at a reduced salary based on the opportunity to engage in teaching and clinical research. With the profound changes in the health care industry over the last few years, this profit no longer exists. In the era of managed care, many insurance companies are reimbursing physicians and hospitals at the cost of services. Combined with cuts in Medicare payments and reduced subsidies for graduate medical education, teaching hospitals can barely afford to pay their medical staff's salary, let alone fund its research. 
These financing changes have had the largest impact on hospitals affiliated with academic medical centers. A recent study found a 22% decline in clinical research conducted at member hospitals of the Association of American Medical College's Council of Teaching Hospitals. This drop is alarming because it demonstrates that these hospitals no longer have the financial resources to contribute to the public's health. Traditionally, academic medical centers trained new doctors, supported applied biomedical research, and provided the bulk of uncompensated care for uninsured patients. Under this system medical residents had the opportunity to treat a wide spectrum of patients, regardless of their health insurance status. In addition, uninsured patients were able to receive the latest care within the scope of clinical trials performed at academic hospitals. With reductions in private and public funding these medical centers have been forced to reduce these social services to compete with for-profit-hospitals with no 
research agenda. This development promises only to stagnate the level of care and number of treatment options that the next generation of doctors can offer their patients. 
Mr. President, my state of New York has 12 medical schools and 40 teaching hospitals, in addition to 8 designated cancer centers. Each of these institutions will be eligible for the Medical Innovation Tax Credit. Without continued funding of research at these institutions, many New Yorkers will recognize a profound effect upon the quality of their health care. Without the opportunity to conduct research many of the country's top doctors may leave to practice in locations where they can earn more money. Such a move will also reduce the need for research specialists and their staffs. Patients will have to choose between hospitals that only recognize the bottom line while their children will not enjoy the same medical advances as they did. Many uninsured patients will not be able to receive uncompensated care and will not be able to receive the most advanced medicine possible. 
And these changes aren't just particular to my state. Almost every state has a medical school which serves as the epicenter for a network of teaching hospitals which employ thousands of physicians, nurses, research specialists, and support staff. A large percentage of each state's economy is based on these medical centers. Thus, we all stand to recognize two main benefits from the Medical Innovation Tax Credit, more jobs and better health. Only by encouraging private investment in medical research can our health care infrastructure develop new and innovative ways to deliver the most advanced care to all citizens of our country. 
We urge all of our colleagues to support this legislation that will restore to medical schools and teaching hospitals the ability to perform applied biomedical research to help treat and cure many of our pressing health needs such as cancer and heart disease. This is a targeted measure which has widespread benefits for all citizens.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, for offering this amendment on my behalf. 
My amendment is simple. It asks the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Interior to report to the House and Senate on the proposed use by the New York City Police Department of the U.S. Coast Guard's facility at Floyd Bennett Field. 
Between early May and early June, the Coast Guard will be moving its air-sea rescue helicopter operation from Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn to Atlantic City. An auxiliary helicopter contingent will be established at Gabreski Airport in Westhampton, New York for the peak summer months to guarantee a maximum Coast Guard coverage for the shores of Long Island and New York City. 
The New York City Police Department wants to move their own search and rescue helicopters into the facility that the Coast Guard is leaving. The Police Department currently uses another hangar for its search and rescue operations at Floyd Bennett Field, but that hangar is old and run-down. For the Police Department to stay in that facility would require some $5.7 million worth of upgrades at their own cost. 
When the Coast Guard leaves, there is a genuine concern that their hangar will go unused for search and rescue operations. It is a larger, more modern facility, well-suited for the purposes of air-sea rescue and emergency response activities. The Police Department merely wants to adequately fill the gap in coverage when the Coast Guard moves on. 
When the Coast Guard leaves, it is likely that the brunt of emergency response calls will fall upon the Police Department. I believe it is a natural fit for the New York City Police Department to take over the Coast Guard's facility so that they may be able to continue and even expand their crucial life-saving and protection role. 
Before the City can even utilize this facility, though, plans to allow this to happen will need to be worked out between the parent agency of the Coast Guard--the Department of Transportation--and the Department of Interior, which will likely take over the land once the Coast Guard leaves. However, action must occur quickly; the Coast Guard will be leaving in less than two months. 
Protecting people's lives must be paramount. My amendment is a public safety issue that will help address that purpose. I thank my colleagues on both sides for recognizing the timeliness and importance of this matter and for accepting this amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Kit Bond. I am pleased to cosponsor this measure. This amendment will help address the devastating effects of the 100-year ice storm which tore through the north country of New York and the Northeast this past January. 
The amendment will provide $260 million in community development block grant (CDBG) funds to State Governments for recovery efforts in federally-declared disaster areas. The CDBG program has the advantage of providing states and localities with a great degree of flexibility in meeting local needs and can be used in the emergency context to fund home repairs, debris removal and the restoration of electrical power to low and moderate income families. 
Mr. President, the six counties in New York which were declared federal disaster areas--Franklin, St. Lawrence, Essex, Clinton, Lewis, and Jefferson--comprise a 7,000 square mile area. This represents an area roughly the size of Massachusetts. Tens of thousands of homes in this area suffered structural damage from ice, severe winds and subsequent flooding. Families were displaced and electricity to over 400,000 people was cut off. The entire high voltage transmission system for this area was wiped out and replaced in a three-week period. 
This amendment will provide much-needed relief for New York homeowners and ratepayers. This assistance is vital to repair storm-related damage to the homes of the families of the north country. Unfortunately, assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan programs have not met all the needs of affected families. These funds will help homeowners repair damaged roofs, plumbing and heating systems. 
In addition, this amendment will also help to address the massive costs associated with the near-total devastation of the region's electric power system. During the storm, nearly 10,000 utility poles were destroyed--many literally snapped in half. Repair crews worked 16- to 18-hour shifts--often in sub-zero conditions in the dead of night--removing downed utility lines, fallen trees and debris, removing destroyed poles from the frozen ground and drilling holes for new poles. 
Line crews and tree-cutting crews were brought in from other regions of New York State, as well as from Pennsylvania, Vermont, Connecticut, Michigan, Virginia, and North Carolina. These crews replaced hundreds of miles of electrical cable, 150 two-pole 90-foot-tall transmission towers and over 2,000 transformers. The equipment and materials for this undertaking had to be brought in from as far away as Oregon, Florida, Georgia, and Nevada. 
Mr. President, without this funding, the costs incurred by this massive restoration effort could be passed on to the utility ratepayers of New York. New York currently has one of the highest electric rates in the nation--some 40% higher than the national average. The hard-working families of the north country who have bravely endured the ice storm should not have to suffer additional increases in their utility bills. 
Mr. President, I commend Senator Bond for including language in this amendment which will ensure that these funds are allocated in a fair and cost-effective manner. Specifically, the amendment provides that funds should be dedicated to states based on unmet needs which have been identified by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). By providing a role to the Director of FEMA, the amendment will help ensure a fair distribution of funds. 
FEMA has made an excellent start in identifying unmet needs which have not been addressed by other federal disaster assistance programs. The February 1998 FEMA Report, `A Blueprint for Action,' clearly identifies the principal unmet needs of New York and the Northeast region resulting from the ice storm. Under the terms of the amendment, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will take into account the costs associated with these unmet needs in making allocation decisions. The amendment effectively addresses concerns which have been raised regarding HUD's past distribution of emergency CDBG funds. Under some previous allocations, large states have fared poorly. Specifically, HUD has at times used a ratio which unfairly penalized states with larger gross products. This amendment effectively addresses those concerns and makes clear that funding allocations are to be based on needs which cannot be addressed through other federal disaster programs. 
In addition, I support Senator Bond's inclusion of a requirement for a State match of public or private funds. This provision is consistent with other federal disaster programs and will help leverage additional resources for disaster recovery efforts. This matching requirement will also give States an added incentive to ensure that funds are used in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 
Mr. President, this amendment is a necessary and vital step to help the families of the north country recover from the devastation caused by the ice storm. These funds will bring much-needed relief to a region which has suffered terrible loss from this natural disaster. 
Once again, let me thank Senator Bond for offering this important measure and providing assistance to the people of New York. In particular, I thank Senator Snowe for her efforts on behalf of the Northeast States affected by the ice storm. Also, my friend Senator Moynihan deserves praise for his efforts on behalf of the people of the north country. He has helped ensure that their voice has been heard here today. Finally, I would like to thank Senator Ted Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for his diligence in bringing this amendment up for consideration by the Senate. I urge its immediate adoption.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I did not intend to speak to this particular amendment because I have an amendment that is sponsored by Senator Moynihan, Senator Jeffords, Senator Leahy, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins and I believe has been accepted by both sides. 
But I think it is rather germane because it seems to me that in times of crisis our Nation sets aside its differences and we come to the aid of our neighbors. I do not say that because you had a disaster in the State of Washington, we are not going to be there to help you. That is what happened, and this country came forward together and made available emergency aid, some several billions of dollars. Then we had floods along the rivers. Those rivers were not in New York, but they were in the United States of America, and my State is part of this country. I think that our citizens would have been very upset with this Senator and my colleague if we had voted against providing aid to those who had their farms wiped out, their homes wiped out, their lives 
disrupted. 
What are we doing? I mean, what in the world are we saying here? Are we saying, really, that you should cut the National Institutes of Health by half a percent to provide emergency relief? For whom? For our citizens. My gosh, we have sent troops all over the world to help out others. Are we really seriously saying that we should not make available disaster relief to our citizens without this clap trap of finding it under a budget cap next year? If it is an emergency, by gosh, the American citizens expect us to rally to our neighbors and to our friends and stop this parliamentary nonsense. That is what this is. 
I want to tell you something. We should move to table this now. I am not going to do it because that is the chairman's spot. It is his responsibility. We have some important business to get done here. I have an amendment that I am going to offer to help the dairy farmers of New York and the people of New York who are devastated--hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage, thousands and thousands of manhours lost. Thousands of homes were ravaged as a result of the ice storm when people's power went out for 2 or 3 weeks, and when they came back to their homes, they found them flooded because the pipes had burst. 
Now, we have to get to the business of the people and do it here and now and not get into this business of saying we are going to offset next year's expenditures. They have to rebuild those homes, and these are people of modest incomes. Are we really going to say here and now, oh, no, we are not going to do that unless we cut low-income assistance programs next year or unless we are going to cut--what program? Tell me. 
Tell me. What happens if you have a $10 billion disaster? Next year someplace we are going to start offsetting it? Let's get to the business of the people. This isn't the business of the people. This is playing games. 
I would like to be able to offer my amendment, and I would like to move to set aside the pending business. I am going to withhold. New Yorkers have been devastated to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
I just think what is being done absolutely puts us in a light that is irresponsible. If we want to make cuts and say that there are programs here that are not of an emergency nature, I will vote on them. If you want to build bicycle trails--I was here when that was put up, and I voted against bicycle trails--and if you want to build igloos someplace and say that is a disaster when it is not, I am going to vote against it. By gosh, let us not simply say that all of the emergency relief should be treated as a nondisaster. That is not being fair to our colleagues.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, in response to the 100-year ice storm which hit the Northeast area of the country, and to address the unmet needs of our dairy farmers, I offer this amendment with my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, Senator Jeffords, Senator Leahy, Senator Snowe, and Senator Collins, to reimburse dairy farmers for up to $10 million for their milk losses. 
Our amendment covers two types of dairy losses: first, the losses that farmers experienced by having to dump their milk because it either could not be shipped to market or it could not be processed properly; and, second, the losses they will see through decreased milk production over the next few months. 
In addition, this amendment will allocate $4 million to provide relief to the dairy farmers who have had a cow die because of the storm. Our amendment, along with the provisions of this bill, will help prevent a lot of dairy farmers who have had thousands of dollars of losses from going out of business. 
When disaster strikes, America responds. The damage, adversity, and loss experienced in the North Country and in New England deserves the attention and assistance of our Government. 
I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee, Senator Cochran, as well as the two ranking members, Senator Byrd and Senator Bumpers, for their support. 
In times of crisis, our Nation sets aside its differences and our own troubles in order to help-out those who are truly in need. 
Beginning on January 5, 1998, six counties in the northernmost part of New York State were ravaged by a fierce winter storm that covered the area in a three-inch blanket of ice. On January 10th, President Clinton declared the region a Federal disaster area. 
This storm caused tremendous damage to homes, farms, roads and infrastructure throughout this area of northern New York--which we call the North Country. 
Tragically, the effects of this storm led to nine deaths in New York. 
This ice storm damaged thousands of utility poles, brought down countless miles of power lines and left several hundred thousand people in the dark for up to three weeks. 
The loss of power in this region had a particularly difficult impact on North Country dairy farmers. 
As some of my colleagues know, dairy cows must be milked at least twice a day, every day. Modern farms use electric milking machines to do this task and then transfer the milk to cooling tanks until it is picked up and taken to an area processing plant. 
With no power, farmers did their best to try and milk their cows. For those who had generators and were able to milk their cows, they had to then store the milk. 
Unfortunately, for a number of dairy farmers, the lack of power to cool the storage tanks made their milk unfit for consumption. 
Farmers also faced the possibility that the milk truck could not reach the farm because icy road conditions, downed trees or downed utility poles made it impossible. 
As these circumstances piled up, individual dairy farmers across the entire Northeast region were forced to dump their milk incurring thousands of dollars of losses along the way. 
Farmers also have had to worry about mastitis. Mastitis is an inflammation of a cow's udder which can take hold in a cow when it is not milked regularly. 
This inflammation can reduce milk production and cause a cow to become sick, requiring treatment with antibiotics. When a cow is being treated with antibiotics, that cow's milk cannot be used. 
When a cow gets out of its milking cycle, there is nothing that can be done to make up for that lost production. That milk, and that income, is lost forever. 
Overall, dairy production losses may likely add up to millions of dollars for dairy farmers in the North Country and northern New England. 
Dairy farmers already run their operations on very tight margins--even a slight decrease in production can cost thousands of dollars and be the deciding factor in determining whether a farmer stays in business or not. 
That is why I am offering this amendment--to help provide a measure of relief for New York and New England dairy farmers. 
With the passage of this amendment, I believe we will help meet the needs of our dairy farmers as they continue to recover from the effects of this storm. 
I am pleased to join with my colleagues in offering this amendment and I urge its adoption.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-sponsor of this concurrent resolution on the Kosovo crisis introduced by my distinguished colleague, Senator Nickles. I want to thank Senator Nickles for taking the lead in introducing this resolution on the critical issue of Kosovo. 
Many of us in the Senate already know something about Kosovo. If the international community doesn't stop Slobodan Milosevic's police and paramilitary from using force and violence to terrorize and drive out members of the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, the American people will come to know Kosovo all too well. 
The bottom line regarding Kosovo, reflected in this resolution, is that the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade continues to deal with the ethnic Albanian majority with guns, knives, and clubs instead of political dialogue. Not having had his fill in Bosnia, Milosevic's regime seems prepared not only to repress the Albanian majority of Kosovo, to harass them, or to discriminate against them because they are not Serbs. 
Now, he has begun to slaughter them. In recent weeks, Serbian security forces have taken the offensive in Kosovo, allegedly going after those Albanians responsible for terrorist acts. In so doing, at least 70 people have been killed--men, women and children--in some villages of central Kosovo. 
Last week, soon after U.S. envoy Bob Gelbard left the region, the bodies of 50 people were removed from the local morgue and bulldozed into a mass grave, without consulting families and in violation of basic human decency. This could well have been an effort to literally bury the evidence of war crimes, because the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague has expressed interest and the families have called for investigation by an international team of forensic experts. 
These killings threaten far worse crimes, including ethnic cleansing on a scale similar to that in Bosnia. This would pose not only a threat to regional peace, but would be a slap in the face for every state and every person who has worked for peace in the Balkans and justice for victims of past ethnic cleansing. 
What is the purpose of this recent violence? Is it to defend Serbian interests from Albanian separatists? No. The purpose is to build hatred, nationalism and tensions in order to maintain and enhance the power of the Milosevic regime. 
Milosevic will crack down on his fellow Serbs, whom he claims to defend, if they threaten his rule. While Kosovar Albanians may want to be independent from Serbia, that fact cannot justify massive, criminal repression. While some Kosovar Albanians may be willing to engage in violence to achieve independence, that fact cannot justfy brutal attacks on innocent people. And while Serbia may want to keep Kosovo, Serbia can only lose Kosovo through these bloody, indiscriminate attacks on the Albanian population. 
The international community must respond to the violence in Kosovo, and this resolution makes some solid suggestions. Nothing is more important than getting an international presence on the ground in Kosovo now, to help deter further human rights violations and to report those that are taking place. While the resolution calls for the International Red Cross to come into Kosovo, as Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I also want the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the OSCE, to be allowed to send in a mission. The OSCE had a presence in Kosovo in 1992 and 1993, and it must be allowed to return. 
Milosevic must face consequences for his policies. Freezing funds belonging to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia is only a first step, if the Contact Group's terms are not met. Resolve is the only thing Milosevic understands, and resolve is what we must show. 
For the violence to stop, Milosevic must be made to believe the so-called Christmas warning issued by President Bush and repeated by President Clinton. Milosevic was warned that we will not let him turn Kosovo into a new battle zone. United States leadership is called for to bring all of the members of the Contact Group into agreement with this strong position. Then, we must stand together and drive the message home. 
Finally, and critically important, is the resolution's call for unconditional talks to achieve a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Kosovo and to provide for the exercise of the legitimate civil and political rights of all persons in Kosovo. Clearly, the current situation is untenable. Once violence is halted, the situation is still not stable. The Serbian oppression of the Kosovar Albanian majority is intolerable, and events have gone too far to expect that the people will accept it. 
This means that progress must be made toward a genuine political solution to the crisis. This cannot be done in a one-sided fashion. The recent Serbian offer of talks was not serious, and was rejected by the Kosovar Albanian leadership. Milosevic must come to the table seriously, without preconditions. That is the path to peace and stability in Kosovo, and the United States must do all it can to push the parties down that path. 
If Kosovo explodes, and it must not be allowed to, it could easily set off a chain reaction leading to wider conflict in the Balkans. For moral and strategic reasons, we cannot let that happen. The stakes are too high, and they involve real, vital United States national interests. The Nickles resolution and its provisions is the right place to start, and I call upon all of my colleagues to support it. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the pending transit amendment to S. 1173, the highway bill. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to make considerable progress on the numerous amendments that have been offered and filed in regard to the highway legislation throughout today's session. 
As earlier announced, the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, will announce when the previously filed cloture vote on a modified substitute amendment to S. 1173 will occur. By unanimous consent, the Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. Members should anticipate a busy voting day with votes continuing into the evening as the Senate attempts to make progress on this important legislation. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I believe we have reached a point where I am not aware of any other outstanding amendments. I think there may be two Senators who, for whatever reason, would object, apparently, to us calling for a vote. But it would be the intention, otherwise, of the leadership to dispose of this amendment by at least 5:45, is what I've been given to understand. 
I don't know what my colleagues might object to or what part of the bill they might want to debate. It would seem reasonable to me that if they do have objection, they should come to the floor and state it. Let's have a vote on it or an attempt to deal with whatever they feel is an inequity. We might lose, we might win, or they may get their way, or they may not. But the business of the people, I believe, would best be served by resolving this. 
I just have no idea at this time as to what their objections might be. So even if I were in a position to remedy the deficiencies--and I am not saying this is a perfect bill; it is far from perfect, and it could be second-guessed by many. But I am not in a position, nor is the ranking member or Senator Reed, who is standing in for Senator Sarbanes, at this point to even offer any type of solution or compromise if we are kept in the dark. 
Now, I don't see any useful purpose in that. So I ask that our respective sides reach out to our colleagues through their staffs to ascertain from them whether they can inform us as to what procedure they would recommend we undertake. If it is to stop the entire bill, then it would seem to me that the leadership should be advised so that they can proceed accordingly. Any Member has the right to lodge his or her objection and to take to the floor and, indeed, make their views known, offer their amendments, or prolong debate. I guess that is a nice way for saying `enter into a filibuster.' I respect that. I have, on occasion, resorted to that myself. 
Now, having said that, I came down to the floor and took the floor and raised my objection. So when we have reduced a bill to a point where all of the Senators, except one or two, have agreed that we should go forward, it seems to me that in fairness to the body we should have some kind of an explanation and set about a course of action to determine how we can deal with it. That would not be my prerogative; that would be the prerogative of the majority and minority leaders. They might decide to file for cloture, or they might decide to undertake another activity, or they might even be able, as I would think, to mediate successfully a cessation of the objections from our colleagues. But I want the Record to note that we have done as much as we can. We are here. We are ready. This bill is ready, 
and, as far as I am concerned and to the best I can determine, this amendment is ready to be acted on. Forty-one plus billion dollars would be spent over the next 5 years on a combination of activities--rural, urban, suburban, new starts, new buses, improvement of existing facilities, extension of some --a whole combination. 
Even at this eleventh-and-a-half hour, there are some very worthy amendments that we have taken dealing with the disabled and giving communities the ability to buy vehicles and put them in a capital program that they might not qualify for, giving additional flexibility to States to use some of these funds. 
So I think it is a well-balanced approach to transportation. I hope my colleagues will give us an opportunity to conduct the business of the people as it should. 
With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and maybe we can get our two colleagues to come down and resolve their differences.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, one of the great problems that we have today is that as more communities grasp the realities of the access to move people, particularly in our urban centers with great densities of traffic, and come to the Federal Transit Administration with their proposals to construct people movers to areas that are alternatively utilizing mass transit, there are some programs that are started that shouldn't be started, for a variety of reasons. 
In some cases, the technical know-how and capabilities that should be there, in terms of studying and getting them ready, just are not. So the Senator says one of the criteria is the technical capabilities to construct the project. You can come in with a wonderful project, but it is `pie in the sky;' it is not possible. And what is taking place is that new starts are being considered, undertaken, lots of money is being laid out by the Federal Government, and engineering studies and what-not are taking place, engineering costs are being racked up, and there is very little likelihood of people ever being able to move. In other words, no transportation project is really going to get underway. 
So I commend the Senator for saying let us take a look and see if this really is real; is it going to work? Obviously, the needs should be tied to the numbers of people that can and should be moved in these new start projects. Again, it is nice to have one in every community. But what is the logic and sense of spending x hundreds of millions of dollars if the numbers of people who would be moved on a daily basis are negligible--if there is no demand? So the Senator sets this as a criterion. 
And the third and probably most important is the degree of local financial commitment to the project; i.e, overmatch. There are those who are attempting to build these projects and think they can do it simply with Federal funds. That is not the case. We look for matching funds. And those communities that recognize the need as such, so they are willing to not only contribute what the minimum contribution from the local community is but overmatch it, put in more, certainly they should have, where funding is available, the ability to draw down those funds faster so those projects can be built. 
Right now I think it would be fair to say that we probably have too many projects that have been given a green light but there is no hope of them moving forward because some of these criteria the Senator has put forth are not met. So this is prudence, in saying, let's do that which can be done. 
I commend the Senator, and I support his amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, there is an outstanding issue between the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Banking Committee involving university transportation centers. Apparently, there are conflicting provisions in our bills. 
I thank my friend and colleague, who has done such an outstanding job, the senior Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his patience. I am committed to working with the chairman to resolve this situation together. I thank him for allowing us to proceed. I believe we will be able to work this out, and I pledge to work with him. He has always demonstrated a willingness to accommodate the needs of his colleagues, and I am looking forward to being able to do it in this case as well. 
Mr. President, let me say that I am deeply grateful for the tremendous leadership and contribution that the senior Senator from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, has contributed, both himself personally and with a great and talented staff, to bring us to this point. I do not know how many people really thought that within this day we would be able to come to a point where we are in a position of passing this part of the Surface Transportation Act overwhelmingly. Without his patience, without his leadership, without his constant support, both during the negotiations for attempting to achieve the additional funding, $9.8 billion over and above the previous ISTEA allocations, we could never have been in a position to accommodate the legitimate interest and needs of so many of our colleagues. 
Again, while we might have differences because we do represent different regions, different configurations of the population where different needs may exist, while not everyone is happy, I am certain that there are those in the mass transit industry who think we need more. Understand, this is not a pie that continues to expand. There are constraints and we have to draw from that which we are allocated. 
On the basis of both working to achieve a greater allocation and working to achieve a fair distribution, no one has done more than my good friend, the Senator from Maryland. For that I am deeply, deeply appreciative. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I thank the Committee on Banking--all of the members. They have been particularly helpful and have made, I think, tremendous contributions to allow us to arrive at this point. 
The Budget Committee, especially Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg--without their help we could not have come to this point. And I thank the leadership of the Senate that has given us the opportunity to work in a collaborative manner and has been supportive. 
I also note, for the Record, and to the chagrin of some, there were some who said, `Oh, the Senate and its leadership don't care about mass transportation, that if you look at the numbers of States that use it or are dependent on those as opposed to those who are not, then those needs will be neglected.' I think that maybe even some colleagues, for whatever reason--some colleagues in the Congress--may have hoped that to be the case. But, once again, I think the common good, and recognizing how we have to deal and must deal with each other, overrode the parochialism that sometimes rears its head. 
I could not be more grateful and thankful for the leadership that has been provided on both sides of the aisle by Senator Daschle, and the minority side, and by Senator Lott on the majority side. 
I say that my staff, particularly Peggy Kuhn, Joe Mondello, Jr., Loretta Garrison, under the able leadership of Howard Menell, staff director, have been Herculean and have been totally dedicated to bringing us to this point. Again, I am deeply appreciative of them. 
I am also appreciative of the professionalism of the minority staff. They have been absolutely outstanding. No one could have asked for better cooperation from the minority staff. Sometimes I think they felt that they worked for me or sometimes I felt that I worked for them. More often Senators, I think, are accountable--people do not realize--to our staff to a great degree. But I thank them. I thank them for their patience and for their persistence and for their working long and enduring hours. They have made, hopefully, the amendment that will be considered a reality. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the pending amendment, the mass transit portion of the highway bill, is one that has been carefully crafted, one that has increased transit in proportion to the needs of our country. I can say quite candidly that there are not sufficient funds to meet all of those needs. Indeed, that is one of the problems that we have attempted to deal with, recognizing the budget constraints that we have. 
Now, let me say we have pending before the Senate from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle well over $15 billion in requests for new transit starts. They come from all over the country. They come from California, they come from Colorado, they come from Utah, they come from Texas, they come from the Carolinas, and they come from the traditional large transit States such as New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois. It will be impossible for us to do justice to all of these. We will have to be selective and mindful of getting the greatest dollar value invested in moving people. That is what we are attempting to do. 
So it was that we have increased substantially the allocations in this area. We have provided some $2.5 billion more for new starts over the life of the bill. 
Now, having said that, notwithstanding this increase, we are talking about providing, in terms of budget authority for these programs, approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, and we have well in excess of $15 billion worth of requests. That does not take into consideration requests that will be coming for desperately needed projects to help unclog the various urban-suburban areas, to move people in the best methodology, getting them off the road where it is possible into a light rail system or into a bus transit system. That does not take into consideration the requests that will be flowing from the House of Representatives. I imagine that they, too, will be numerous. 
Now, in terms of where the greatest increases have been as they relate to resources, I want to point out we have increased, by way of percentage over and above the 1991 figures, 38 percent more for rural America, recognizing their needs. Is that enough? No, absolutely not. But can we accommodate all of the needs of mass transit, given the budget constraints? No, we can't. So we have to attempt to prioritize. That is what we have done. They have received the largest increase as it relates to any particular section of America--38 percent--recognizing that traditionally they have not used mass transit and that it is now becoming something that rural America, suburban America, is turning to more and more. 
Now, whenever my colleagues have suggested there be some departures and radical formula changes that would provide $1.5 billion more for rural America, would this Senator like to do that? Certainly, but where do we get the money? Now, let's be honest with this; if we are going to get into a game of taking from those who have a demonstrated need to increase disproportionately the dollars allocated under this bill, we are going to have trouble having a bill. I suggest that is not why we are here. Ours should not be a game of saying how do I enrich or how do I get extra for my State. 
I suggest, when it comes to the highway transportation bill, this Senator said, `Look, we recognize that there have been a number of States that have had incrementally faster growth, have greater needs, have not gotten back a percentage which can be defended in terms of the revenues they send to Washington from the gasoline tax, and they should get a higher benefit from the additional funds that are provided for transportation.' That is why the formula as it relates to distribution is one that I will support, notwithstanding the percentage that my State gets goes down, goes down because we are talking about fairness. 
If we are going to operate in terms of meeting all of the needs, then we can't simply say, `Oh, no, I can't have any less a percentage, I have to have more or the same,' I think we have to look at basic fairness. So I am really putting forth an appeal here to suggest that we not attempt to come up with a formula that is going to give a few dollars more to a majority of the States, to build a coalition on that basis as opposed to what is fair. 
Now, if this bill did not provide 38 percent more for rural America, then I could see the Senators from the rural districts coming in and saying, `Where is our fair share?' But 38 percent more has been provided. That is more than any other--if you want to say particularly large State, small State, rural State--has received. It is in total proportion because as it relates to the new starts, our smaller urban areas will be getting them. That is open to all of America based on a competitive form there, and it fits within the budget caps because those moneys spend out slower. 
So I say to my friends here, in all due honesty, this Senator wants to be accommodating, and will be. We didn't get to this position now where we have, I believe, a well-crafted bill--I am willing to entertain any suggestion for improvement, but I have to start out saying, to come to this Senator with a $1.5 billion request, which has come from staff to staff, for more in one area, simply because you can line up the votes on the basis of pure numbers, is not what we should be about. It is wrong. It is counterproductive. While I respect meeting legitimate requests and needs of the Members and of communities and to demonstrate one's concern for his or her constituency, certainly that is to be applauded. But let's look at the constraints of the budget and what we are operating under. I would like to give to rural America $5 billion of the $5 billion that we have allocated, but then how do we meet the needs of the rest of the country? 
I hope we will not get into pity for the so-called rural States because some ingenious staff members have developed a program whereby they can count and figure that we can put 30 some odd States together and we are going to get each State a few dollars more, and then don't they come down here and say `We will vote for our State because, after all, I have to vote for my State.' That is not what this bill should be about. That is not what this body should be about. I really dislike having to call that to the attention of our Members. 
And this is a Senator who has supported those programs and policies that are important to the regional interests of my colleagues and their States. I have never come down here and said, `Well, what do we get?' I am asking now for a little bit of equity here. If my colleagues are going to attempt to go forth on this--and I must say to you that I have held out until my staff could meet with some coalition. But when we met, we were told they want $300 million a year more. Where does it come from? 
I say to my friends, my colleagues, you are not going to get it under the budget authority. Even if I went along with that, the Budget Committee is not going to be able to find that money because it spends out faster. 
Secondly, there is the question of fairness. To say we are going to increase an allocation and say that we want an 85-plus percent increase--that is what people are saying. My gosh, if you want to say let's look and see if we can do somewhat better, that is one thing. But to come in and say you want an 85 percent increase, that is horrendous. It is not reasonable. 
If we want a bill--and this Senator wants a bill--then I say to those colleagues who have every right to lobby for the interests and to work for the interests of the people of their State, let's do so with some reasonableness so we can have an accommodation. I don't want to be opposing friends and colleagues simply because I say that we have the best way. We have a limited amount of resources. I think we have been fortunate enough to get to the point that we have, where we have stretched the resources of both our committee and the Budget Committee. 
This isn't a situation where we can just open it up. By the way, we can use money for buses as fast as anybody else. But that spends out quicker. The Budget Committee isn't going to be able to find the money if we do that. I say to my colleagues, if you are on the floor, let's have a little balance. When I have staffers sitting down with our staff, when we say let's look and see, and they say we need $1.5 billion more or $300 million more, that is not being reasonable. That is going beyond. To say we want $1.5 billion, and to jigger the formulas around so we are not doing it on a per capita basis--but we are changing that also--that is not going to work. 
Mr. President, I say let's go forward in the spirit of attempting to ascertain whether there are methodologies available to provide additional resources. That is fine. But to come forward in this manner and say, well, we have a coalition of X number of States--I have done that before. We have had to defend against formula changes. I don't like it. It's not conducive to working together for the best interests of our States, our region and, more importantly, the people of our country as a whole. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. I want the Senator to know that I absolutely understand the equity and the justice which the Senator seeks. There is no denying it, under the old formula as it related to rail modernization, fixed rail modernization, that those communities that heretofore did not have a system would not have moneys allocated to them. That is why we attempted to structure--and this gets a little complex, but I think the Senator knows this, and probably even to a far greater degree than the Senator from New York. I commend the Senator from Colorado for a thoughtful approach to dealing with this inequity. What the Senator is saying to these 11 cities is: Look, you have been drawing down, traditionally, X dollars. Let the program operate that way and let those additional funds over and above be allocated to the other areas of the country which have not been drawing those funds. That is the essence of the Senator's amendment. Is that a fair characterization?  
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Certainly. So now I have to say to my colleague that that would appear unfair, and I think there is something to be said for recognizing a basic situation that should not continue as we have new growth throughout the regions of our country. I think the Senator's State is one that goes right to that. There is tremendous growth in the Denver area and other areas where heretofore mass transit was never looked upon as a necessity, or something that was on the minds of people. Now, moving college students or senior citizens or others from the suburban region into the business districts, back and forth, becomes important, whether it be by way of bus, light rail, et cetera. That is why the committee attempted to deal with this, and I commend the Senator for a balanced presentation of his amendment, because he took time out to recognize that the committee attempted to deal with this by making available those funds over and above the previously allocated level, $760 million annually, available to the communities that heretofore have not shared in that. 
It may be that in that distribution of funds the Senator from Colorado could differ with us, because what we have done is recognize that these systems that are in existence need continual refurbishment, and there are billions of dollars being poured in from the State and local governments. Indeed, my State allocates at least 50 cents for every 50 cents that comes from Washington. It matches it. Indeed, in many projects it overmatches, it puts much more than that in because they have allocated, by way of the transit box and local revenues, these funds. It becomes so critical. 
I might say, and I am giving an approximation, 30 percent of all mass transit riders nationwide are in New York. We draw down considerably less in the way of all of the transit dollars. We do not overdraw in terms of the numbers of people moved, nor do we put in the application of local tax dollars that go into these systems. In a minute I am going to give you the exact number. 
We have the lowest subsidy in the Nation per rider; that is 34 cents. If we are going to take a nationwide average, it is 64 cents per rider. 
I just say this so we get a balance. Why do we need a balance? Because if we are going to get into the situation of saying 11 cities draw 80-plus percent, or 90 percent of the funds, we have to look at what are the numbers of people being moved and what is the percentage in terms of people being moved and their contribution and moneys coming back from the Federal Government. I do not have the number yet but I think it will be an interesting one, and I should have it. We are looking to get it--in terms of how many people are being moved. 
And I would venture to say that we are probably moving more than two-thirds of the Nation's mass transit riders in those 11 communities. Now, having said that, those are more than communities, they are regions--regions--because when we talk about New York, it is servicing Connecticut, it is servicing New Jersey, as well as all New Yorkers. 
When you talk about the transit system of Chicago, for example, it takes in a huge expanse. It is not just the 3-and-a half-plus million people in Chicago, but all of the outlying areas--that is, regions. So I think we have to think about this. And if you take the Philadelphia transit system, again, people from Delaware, people from New Jersey, as well as the Pennsylvania region come in. 
In no way am I attempting to diminish the Senator's argument--or not even argument but presentation--to say, look, as it relates to the newer funds, we want those over and above what have been traditionally put forth, and an opportunity to have a more significant sharing of the revenues. The Senator did point out that in this bill, for the first time, we have provided that--maybe not to the Senator's standards or to that which you would think would be fair, but we have provided that new-starts funds over $1 billion, above what we have provided, will be shared on a 50-50 basis, recognizing that these 11 areas that now serve--I will get that number; but let us use a number--at least 70 percent of the Nation's transit riders. And I think that is a number that is fairly accurate. They will continue to have a need to modernize. They will continue to have a need to make the kinds of improvements that are so desperately necessary. 
Some of these transit systems are 100 years old. So, consequently, if we do not provide additional revenues to these starts, we are going to have great difficulties in the maintaining of these older systems. 
So while my colleague makes a good point--and I notice the Senator from Minnesota is here, Senator Grams; and I know he is working with you on this--while there is every reason to logically say, you have to provide for our needs, we started to do this. I take great pride in that. And our bill prior to your coming to the floor and prior to our markup last year, we did provide for a fairer, better allocation. It may be that it is not enough. 
But let me simply say this to my colleague, that it would be, in this Senator's opinion, unacceptable--and this is important because it goes to the heart of where I am coming from--it would be absolutely unacceptable to say to 70 percent of the mass transit riders, to the communities that carry 70 percent of the mass transit riders, that as it relates to additional funds, you cannot have any more. Now, just as it would be unreasonable for us to cling to the old formula, it would be unreasonable to say, as it relates to additional funds, you cannot have any. 
What I am saying to my friends and colleagues, to both of you, is, please, let us sit down, and make your presentations, because I do not argue against the thrust of what you are going to say, that you want some of these resources, and see if we cannot work on a system that will do fairness to your position and yet recognize the necessity of having an increasing dollar allocation to these old systems that are moving tens and tens of millions of people and do need these additional funds. 
That is where this Senator is coming from, not coming from, `It has got to be my way or this way.' But let us look at it in that way. If we can, I believe we would have the ability to serve the needs of our own communities. I recognize that. There is no one who fights harder and sometimes has been accused of parochialism for the people of his State than I, so I recognize when my colleagues have that interest and good intent for their States. But let us see if we cannot do it in that manner, where we really do the best we can with the limited resources. And I am very willing to sit down and talk to them.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the ranking member, Senator Sarbanes, for recognizing what we as a committee and our staffs have attempted to do in coming up with a bill that does not nearly meet the needs of all of our constituents because there are spending limitations. We are going to have a tough time. I can tell the Chair that we have a minimum of $15 billion-plus worth of requests for new starts. And I think if you were to look at them, you could probably--and I am not attempting to rank them; that is not my job. There is a procedure which does that, and I think they should be ranked, but as it relates to cost-benefit, numbers of people moved--I know when you look at the city of Denver, where my colleague comes from, there is no doubt that the program being advanced by the city and metropolitan region will be probably one of the highest ranked. But they are going to have to earn that ranking. But you can't have that kind of development and not believe that it's not going to be there. 
Demonstrated need is the key. In fairness to my colleague, I don't want to imply that he is arguing for any change on that. I am simply saying that when we look at the numbers of applications that will be coming in, I have to tell you that there will not be nearly enough resources to do them all. I hope that, in the fullness of time, we will be able to get a better allocation for mass transit generally. I think we are being very, very myopic as it relates to the manner in which we are allocating resources nationwide. It is easy to put money in and justify for highways. It has a very strong base of support. That is undeniable. But something that is even more important, or equally as important, is when we look at our major urban centers throughout this country, we are going to begin to find in those fast-developing areas in the South and far West, as people migrate, you are going to have incredible problems, whether it be in Atlanta, Denver, Memphis, et cetera. As these areas build and develop, we are going to want to be able to move these people. Unless we provide the resources, it's not going to happen. So we have had a rather unbalanced--I think the last time we provided any moneys was in the legislation that I authored, and I had a tremendous battle, back in 1982. It authorized 1 penny out of the nickel to be set aside from gasoline for mass transit. 
Let me say this to you. If it sounds like I am self-aggrandizing, I don't mean to. But, thank God, we were able to get those moneys set aside. I have heard more people complaining about that. What a myopic view. Where would some of the systems in their States be? They have come on rather recently, and they have applications for more, and I am talking about large States that have to move large numbers of people. Their representatives are complaining about that 1 penny set-aside. Well, what would you have then in terms of any type of new start or mass transportation? We would not be having this debate and we would not be having a mass transit bill. 
Some people say, oh, we don't care, we don't need it, we don't want it. That is a rather narrow-minded point of view. So I have to say, thank God, we are at this point where at least we have limited resources that have been provided as a result of the 1 penny set-aside as opposed to no resources that we would have. We would not have any. So maybe we are lucky that the Senator, at this point in time, can come to the floor and say, `Listen, we want a better allocation on that.' I don't fault him for that. I think he has real merit in his position of saying, `There is this need, so can't we do better?' I say to the Senator that I want to try to do better under these. I hope we can come to the floor some day, sooner rather than later, because the expressed, absolute need--by the way, we save lives. When you get people out of the automobiles in congested areas where sometimes they are stuck 30 minutes when coming through a bridge or tunnel, whatever, and put them on a modern system that moves them back and forth, you take out tons and tons of pollution. 
We have one project that we are looking at in terms of removing 1 million trucks a year off of the roads between New York and New Jersey. It is a tunnel project. It is not part of this bill. They estimate that we will be able, as a result of this one tunnel, to save in the New York City region 3,000 lives annually--3,000 people who otherwise would be dying. That is not to talk about the incredible hospital costs that go into it, the hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of asthmatics, et cetera. That is just one little project. 
We are talking about another one for moving 100,000 people a day who now have to make a cross-town transfer. They come into New York City on one side of the city and then have to transfer and go all the way over to the other side to get to their job, and then come all the way over again. They are talking about eliminating 12,000 taxicab rides a day. They are talking about saving $900 a year for 100,000 people who have to pay then to go back and forth. In terms of hours, it's about an hour a day for each one of these 100,000 people. So the man-hours can be saved. 
The pollution that would result will be cut down, and the quality of life will be enhanced. These are the kinds of things that can and should be available to us. There is an underlying problem in this bill--a big one: we don't provide sufficient resources. We can't, unfortunately. There are the budget constraints. So, I think we all have to recognize that there has to be a little give and take on this thing. This is not going to be good for us if we have to make changes in terms of a parochial sense to take less. I think the Senator from Maryland stated it well. We get back a smaller percentage as it relates to the highway that we received previously. But we had to recognize that there are expanding areas and they need some money. I am willing to recognize that here. But I need some help in arriving at that, because there is an underlying deficiency. I might say to those colleagues who are going to say we need more, then help us and support us when it comes to providing additional resources for all of mass transit, so that we can see that rural America and urban America are not in conflict and we can make those needs. 
Right now, our job becomes impossible to meet all of the needs, due to the lack of resources. That is a fact. And were it not for the incredible work of the Budget Committee, and particularly Senator Domenici, in finding available resources, we would not even be at this point, and the inequity and problems would be even greater. 
So I thank my colleague, Senator Sarbanes. Again, I want to commend the Senator from Colorado for coming forth in a way, hopefully, that will provide additional resources to the people not only in this region but in like regions throughout the country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I believe that we have made substantial progress and, hopefully, we will be able to come to an accommodation that will meet the needs a number of my colleagues have expressed relating to the fixed rail modernization system. We are working on that at the present time. I hope we are going to be able to further deal with the question of New Starts in a way that will be satisfactory to my colleagues. 
Last, but not least, it is my hope that we can resolve even the most contentious of points if those who are advocating changes will either meet with our staffs or come to the floor for the purposes of introducing their amendments so we can dispose of this significant portion of the bill, hopefully today. I believe we can, or certainly we can make very significant progress. 
If we are not going to have agreement, then I can tell you it is my intent, after negotiations and after deliberations and debate, to move to table those amendments on which we cannot come to an agreement. But I hope we will work to the best of our ability. I think by putting this off we are not going to add to the likelihood of finishing this chapter of the bill today, and that is my hope. 
This is an important piece of legislation which I believe the Senate, and I know Senator Lott, our majority leader, is anxious to dispose of. That means the difference between States doing nothing and States beginning their highway projects in an orderly fashion, undertaking the necessary work to get their transit systems going and improving them. There are contracts that have to be let out. It takes time. 
So, the sooner we get this done the more likely that some of the programs that otherwise will not continue, or start, this spring, will get started. We have to give the States assurance that there is going to be an orderly flow of funds. So I urge my colleagues if they have provisions or have statements they want to make, between now and 12:15 they can certainly come down. That would be a good time to make those statements. If there is legislation that they seek, now is the time to make it known to the committee, to the staff, and seek either an accommodation or action on their legislation. Certainly between now and 12:15, if anyone wants to come down to speak to these issues, or 12:30 when we go out--or thereafter, when we reconvene at 2:15--we are ready, willing and able to deal with whatever ramifications my colleagues might have or whatever legislative solution they might look for. We are willing to discuss and entertain their legislative proposals, again, by way of staff work directly, or the Senator meeting with his colleagues and/or Senators offering legislation. We can attempt to dispose of their legislative proposals one way or the other. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me first say I tremendously appreciate the work and the contribution and the support the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, has given to the committee in bringing this amendment to this point. He has been constructive. He has been helpful. I particularly appreciate his efforts as they relate to that part of the program that concentrates primarily on attempting to meet the needs of those people who are trying to get off welfare. We are talking about the people who want to help themselves. He has been a leader in this area. Indeed, we have provided more funds and specifically targeted them to getting transportation for people who otherwise cannot get to work. 
Later, I believe a number of our colleagues will be coming to the floor. I am going to ask those who might be listening and/or their staffs, to please, if they have amendments, come on down. Let's deal with them. I believe the Senators from Pennsylvania have an amendment that maybe a great number of colleagues would be willing to support. I know Senator Reed would probably be one of the prime sponsors, in terms of enhancing that program, and that is programs to help people to get to work to get off the welfare rolls. So that is a plea I make to them. 
At this point, I would like to recognize the outstanding work of Senators Allard and Grams in relationship to making, I think, an important contribution to this bill in seeking great balance. I believe the distinguished Senator from Colorado has an amendment he would like to offer.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me say I am deeply appreciative of the work of my colleagues, Senator Allard and Senator Grams, and for their patience, for their diligence in working on behalf of their constituents and, more importantly, recognizing the need for balance, the need to meet the needs of the high-growth cities in the United States, which they represent, but also recognizing the needs of the older cities, the older transportation hubs, that also need to continue to get adequate funding. 
In addition, I am looking forward to working with my colleagues towards addressing the growing needs for mass transit in growing cities such as Minneapolis/St. Paul and Denver. They have unique problems. The problems of attaining the clean air standards certainly are not those just found in the cities of Boston or New York or Philadelphia. Indeed, in areas that we may not have ever considered, these are problems. They are. Cities like these must receive an equitable portion of the New Start funds so they may begin to implement mass transit as a solution of their problems of traffic congestion and air quality. Again, I commend them, and I am committed to working with my colleagues on this issue and on the issues of eligibility for funds under the fixed guideway formula. 
Might I also say, I thank again, in all of this, my colleague and friend, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for working to achieve this balance. 
Mr. President, I ask acceptance of the amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I urge those Members who have amendments to come to the floor so that we can work on their amendments. This could have been one of the most contentious amendments and, indeed, started out on the very basis that almost no one saw a resolve of it. We can work through these amendments because we are willing to meet and speak to those who want to be heard. But they cannot be heard if they do not come to the floor. 
I have asked that my colleagues from Pennsylvania, who have a unique amendment, one that attempts to help accelerate people from welfare into productive jobs, and helps them get to work, come on down and offer their amendment, because at some point in time we are going to move to close this. If they want to object, I am going to ask that they be here to object personally. 
So I do not think that this bill is completed, by any stretch of the imagination, but I think we would like to move on it rather than put us in a quorum call and wait. So again, I can only suggest, come on down, offer your amendments, or at least have your staffs meet with our staffs so we can discuss a resolve of this so we can get this important legislation passed. 
Mr. President, having nothing further in the way of any kind of productive suggestions at this point in time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, may I suggest to the Senator, if he could offer it, it would be appropriate to offer the amendment that I believe the Senator intends to offer as it relates to providing for transportation needs of those who are seeking jobs outside of the inner cities. I think it is a well-crafted amendment and one that the Senator has worked on and has spoken to, and one that Senator Santorum has worked on and spoken to, and one that Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has worked on and spoken to. We are willing to entertain that and support it. It would be added as an amendment to the existing amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, we have maintained in this, as it relates to the construction of a ferry, the same worker protection language that heretofore has existed in mass transportation. I would like to call that to the attention of the Chair. 
I thank the Senator for his initiative in this most important opportunity to get people off of the welfare rolls and see to it that they do have access to the jobs that are increasingly growing in number in the suburbs. 
I ask I be added as a cosponsor.

Mr. DAMATO. If I might suggest to the Senator, I believe that we are very close to resolving the minimum allocation amendment as initially proposed and that we are very close to coming to a settlement in which additional resources will be provided to the rural States and rural communities without a disfigurement, so to speak, of the basis of mass transit funding, the formulas which provide for most, or the highest number of people being moved on the basis of need. So I recommend at this time, knowing the Senator is a great, great supporter of mass transit but has sought balance, that we proceed to dispose of this legislation. And I think within a matter of minutes we will be able to go forward with a compromise.

Mr. DAMATO. Let me, if I might, say I think we are very close to arriving at a compromise. I want to pay particular tribute to a new colleague of ours, although he is not new to the legislative process. I think he has demonstrated the kind of leadership that makes it a great pleasure for me to chair the Banking Committee. I am talking about Senator Johnson, who initially came forward and said our rural States are not getting sufficient funding to meet our needs. And, indeed, the compromise we are forging is one in which there can and still will be room for them, in the future, to come forward and ask for more. 
We are addressing an imbalance that has existed over a number of years. He has been joined in that effort by Senator Thomas of Wyoming. And, again, the two have carried this in a manner that makes doing the business of the people something that we can be proud of. We did not, nor did it ever reach the business of trying to see who had more votes, who had more muscle; but, rather, how, with limited resources, could we do the business of the people to the best of our ability. 
We need more money for this bill to be able to meet all the transit needs of this country. We do not have it. So I applaud both of my colleagues for bringing us to a point where I believe we can enact legislation that begins to address their concerns. It does not fully address them, but it begins to move the process in the right direction, and yet recognizes the tremendous needs that those in the urban States still have.

Mr. DAMATO. We are prepared to accept this amendment. It strikes a balance. It provides $250 million more for those rural communities that are at populations of under 50,000. It can be accomplished within the framework of the budget. We believe, as a result of the reconfiguration of the distribution of the $5 billion, that it will be done in such a way as to maximize the dollars that have been provided by the Budget Committee, the budget authority and the outlays, and that it will not do violence to the agreement. 
It reduces the new starts by $150 million from $2.5 billion to $2.35 billion. It reduces those dollars that would go to the discretionary bus program from $500 million to $400 million and then adds $250 million to the rural formula program, so that my colleagues who represent rural America will be producing, under this bill, $500 million--a half a billion dollars--over and above what the committee had initially reported out. 
Mr. President, I believe it is a good compromise, and I can be totally supportive of it. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I congratulate again both Senators who worked and built a broad-based coalition and yet recognized that this really is an equity that we seek throughout this country. It is not always easy and not always easy to obtain. But I thank them for their cooperation. 
Mr. President, I know of no other Senator who seeks the floor, but let me say this before I suggest the absence a quorum. We have now, as far as I can see, disposed of all of the outstanding amendments that I have been made aware of up until this point. 
If Senators do have amendments that they wish to offer, I hope they will do so. I believe the leader is going to seek a unanimous consent to put out over the hotline to get a time certain to vote. We have made great progress. Again, I urge my colleagues to have their staffs meet with our staffs or come to the floor to take up any question they might have so that we can resolve these issues and continue the progress that we have made on this bill. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment which will reauthorize the mass transit program under ISTEA. 
First of all, I thank my colleagues for the many months of negotiations and hard work necessary to produce this breakthrough agreement which has resulted in the amendment that we have offered. 
What I intend to do is just briefly give an outline and, hopefully, with the concurrence of the majority leader and other Members, we will take this matter up for fuller discussion and consideration tomorrow morning. But let me first thank the ranking member on the Banking Committee for his support during this very difficult time. Senator Sarbanes has been steadfast in his support and in his approach to working out a balanced transit package. 
Let me also thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for without him and his ability to see that the levels of increase can be accommodated in the budget, we would have no opportunity of going forward. 
Then, of course, there is my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and his steadfastness in helping to achieve this balance. 
In total, our amendment will authorize $41.3 billion for mass transit over the next 3 years. That represents a 30-percent increase from the $31.5 billion authorized in the 1991 ISTEA bill. Our amendment provides for funding levels that are $12.6 billion over the administration's NEXTEA proposal. 
The amendment will also provide $5 billion more than the Banking Committee bill reported out by a 17-to-1 margin last September. We have been able to achieve this increase thanks to a bipartisan coalition of 24 Senators, including our present Presiding Officer. I thank the Senator from Texas for her graciousness and for her support, because I think it is a recognition of the growing needs of mass transit.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, these additional funds will benefit transit operators of all sizes in both urban and rural areas, and in order to meet the new demands for bus and rail systems across the Nation, half the increase--$2.5 billion--will be spent only on new starts. The rural transit program will enjoy a $354 million increase over the amount authorized in the 1991 ISTEA bill. 
Over the last 15 years, transit funding has remained relatively flat while highway funding has soared. In 1982, the Federal Government spent $4 billion on mass transit and $9 billion on highways. In 1998, the Government will spend $4.8 billion on transit while spending has grown to $23 billion. 
Meanwhile, the demands for transit funding have grown exponentially. Communities in high-growth cities are facing problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality while older transit cities, such as New York and Chicago, need additional funds to maintain and improve transit service. With this increase in mass transit funding, we can now address many of these needs. 
More than 80 million Americans, almost one-third of the U.S. population, cannot drive or do not have access to a car. For these people, mass transit is usually the only means of transportation available. The Nation's 32 million senior citizens and 24 million people with disabilities require reliable, safe public transportation service to maintain their independence. 
According to the Federal Transit Administration's annual report, U.S. businesses would lose $15 billion a year because of highway traffic congestion if all U.S. transit commuters drove to work instead. More than half of all transit trips are work trips, and people who use transit come from every income level and demographic background. 
Federal transit programs benefit communities of all sizes across the Nation. Today, rural transit carries riders more than a billion miles every year. Rural areas have a higher percentage of elderly and disabled populations who are increasingly dependent on mass transit for basic transportation needs. 
Madam President, in closing, I thank the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee. 
Mr. Sarbanes has been a steadfast ally in these negotiations. 
And, once again, without the cooperation of my Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, and the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, we never would have come to this point.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness Act and I encourage the support of my colleagues in order to address the serious threat facing our nations' financial industry. While the new millennium brings with it the hopes and dreams of a new era, it is also accompanied by a significant threat to all Americans who use our technology dependent banking industry. The Congress must insure that our regulators are provided with the power and authority to protect the savings of all Americans. 
Mr. President, nearly every hard working American citizen uses a bank, savings and loan or credit union. Banks in particular represent a symbol of safety and trust where Americans feel confident about placing their savings and conducting financial transactions. The widely reported Year 2000 problem places that safety and trust at risk. For a variety of reasons, computer software systems and devices have traditionally used two characters to represent the year in date calculations. A typical scenario involves a system that arranges a date to perform a comparison or calculation. For example, comparing the year 2000 to the year 1998, could result in 1998 being identified greater than 2000. The potential fallout could range from a simple miscalculation of interest on savings accounts, to the complete loss of customer records, and possibly even jeopardizing the viability of an institution. These systems must be validated to insure that they will function properly after December 31, 1999. 
The Examination Parity and Year 2000 Readiness Act requires Federal financial regulatory agencies to conduct seminars on the implication of the Year 2000 problem and extends the same examination authority bank regulators already posses to thrift and credit union regulators. This legislation enjoys bipartisan Congressional support and has the endorsement of the executive branch. With the proper attention and focus of our federal regulators, the savings of American citizens can be protected and the safety and soundness of the American banking industry can be assured. 
Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Bennett, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, for his tireless effort to help solve the problems our financial intermediaries will face because of the year 2000 problem. With his usual perseverance, he has demonstrated the important role Congress has in understanding the impact of technology on the financial system. I also commend Senator Dodd for cosponsoring the Senate bill. Of course, quick action on this measure by the House was made possible by Chairman Leach's recognition of the need for this legislation.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, investors place their trust as well as their funds in our capital and financial markets. It is clear that one of the reasons for this trust is the knowledge that financial statements are reliable, relevant, consistent, comparable and prepared according to well-understood and carefully considered standards, known as generally accepted accounting standards. These financial reporting standards are an essential component of the attraction of our capital markets--to borrowers who are looking for the most capital at the lowest cost and to suppliers of capital who want to invest with confidence and earn a high return. 
This openness and transparency is the result of the useful and highly successful mechanism used in the United States for over 60 years to develop financial reporting and accounting standards. Although Congress empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set accounting standards in 1934, for over sixty years the Commission has delegated this responsibility to the private sector. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has exercised the delegated authority to develop accounting standards, subject to SEC review, since 1972. In that year, a blue ribbon commission, created by the SEC, recommended the creation of the FASB in order to insulate its deliberative process from the influence of special interests and politics. The FASB's task is to establish and improve financial standards in an inclusive, public and deliberative manner. 
Mr. President, while I have not always agreed with the FASB's pronouncements and activities over the years, I believe strongly in an independent standard setting body and I believe the FASB has worked well. It has earned praise for its evenhanded, principled and well-reasoned decisions from professionals in the accounting profession, from the SEC and the financial media, and investors. 
Mr. President, at times, the FASB's activities have generated controversy and opposition from those affected by and opposed to its pronouncements. At this particular moment, the FASB is encountering stiff criticism as a result of its attempt to require institutions who hold derivatives to provide some type of fair market value financial reporting. 
As my colleagues are aware, derivatives are highly complex financial instruments that can and do perform an important role in effective risk management by enabling commercial corporations, governments and financial firms and others, in the U.S. and worldwide, to reduce their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, currency exchange rates, and the prices of equities and commodities. Derivatives also enable users to reduce funding costs and speculate on changes in market rates and prices. But Congress is also well aware that the use and misuse of derivatives can cause severe financial shocks. Hearings held by the Banking Committee in recent years demonstrated that derivatives improperly used, and inadequately regulated, can expose an institution or company to potential ruin with serious consequences for depositors, investors, taxpayers and, potentially, the stability of the financial system. 
Mr. President, regulatory agencies and Congress have studied the numerous regulatory, policy and disclosure issues raised by derivatives. Among the more serious findings is that derivatives generally do not need to be accounted for in financial statements. In other words, there are billions of dollars worth of derivatives outstanding that are not reflected adequately in the financial statements of major industrial companies, banks and other large derivative users. 
In 1994 a GAO study, (Financial Derivatives: Actions Needed to Protect the Financial System), recommended that the FASB: 
Proceed expeditiously to issue its existing exposure draft on disclosures of derivatives and fair value of financial instruments. 
Proceed expeditiously to develop and issue an exposure draft that provides comprehensive, consistent accounting rules for derivative products, including expanded disclosure requirements that provide additional needed information about derivatives activities. 
Consider adopting a market value accounting model for all financial instruments, including derivative products. 
Mr. President, the FASB is earnestly pursuing this complicated objective with the support of the SEC, the accounting profession and most investment professionals. The critics and opponents of the proposed derivative accounting standards are now taking the extraordinary step of asking Congress to intervene in the FASB's standard setting procedures. This not only threatens the FASB's ability to determine appropriate standards for disclosure of derivatives-related information, it seriously jeopardizes its independence. This course of action is extremely unwise and provides continuing justification for having an independent, professional entity to set accounting and financial reporting requirements, like the FASB, rather than the Congress or a government agency. 
Mr. President, it is obvious that Congress lacks the technical expertise and resources to develop accounting standards, as does the SEC. In addition, federal bank regulators lack the impartiality to administer disclosure standards dedicated to investor protection and public disclosure since the banking laws are geared to maintaining public confidence in financial institutions rather than requiring the full and complete disclosure of a financial institution's real financial condition. 
Mr. President, Congress should resist the suggestion of removing standard setting from the public sector and transferring it to a government agency. If history is any guide, this step would create more problems than it would solve. Every recent effort by a government agency, including the Congress, to set accounting standards has been a total failure. For example, during the early days of the savings and loan crisis, the FSLIC (Federal Savings and Loan Corporation--the former S&L regulator) created `supervisory goodwill' as a mechanism by which healthy thrifts could acquire or invest in fledgling ones. Regulators permitted supervisory goodwill to qualify as regulatory capital. Then, in 1989, Congress enacted stricter capital standards under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) and mandated that all supervisory goodwill was to be charged-off over an accelerated period ending in 1994, causing severe capital constraints, even pushing some S&Ls to liquidate assets at a severe discount. Between the actions of the regulators and the Congress, the S&L crisis lasted longer than necessary, the recovery took longer than necessary and eventually ended in a $130 billion dollar taxpayer-financed bailout. In fact, the final costs to the federal government of the S&L bailout may increase as a result of the ongoing `supervisory goodwill litigation.' 
Mr. President, the FASB started working on derivatives and hedging in 1991. It has had an extensive and open process that has involved ample opportunity for public comment, debate and participation by all constituents. This open and deliberative process is still ongoing and will, in the end, produce thoughtful and comprehensive accounting standards that will better inform investors and the financial markets as a whole and contribute to their effective functioning. 
Mr. President, I do not want to dwell on the S&L crisis or on the benefits and risks of derivatives. Instead, I simply want to underscore that Congress should not disrupt the FASB's independence and professionalism in setting accounting standards, for derivatives or for any other project. The SEC has jurisdiction over the FASB and the Congress already conducts oversight of the SEC and the FASB. In fact, the Subcommittee on Securities has held two hearings on the derivatives issue. I would oppose authorizing the SEC, or any other federal agency, to set accounting standards. We should leave to the private sector the responsibility to develop accounting and financial reporting standards that are at the heart of the success of our process of capital formation.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly comment on the program of German reparations being paid to Holocaust survivors. Over the past two years, we have looked extensively at the role Swiss banks played during the Holocaust. What we found was shocking. Clearly we discovered that in addition to carrying out the mass murder of millions of people, Jews and non-Jews, the Nazis carried off the greatest robbery in history. 
After the war, the new government of Germany began a program of restitution for the survivors of the Holocaust. Over the past half-century, Germany has paid billions of dollars to survivors, but can we really say that this is enough? Can we say that it is fair that someone who survived, for example, five months in a concentration camp, but not the six required to obtain compensation, is fair? Can we say that it is fair that someone who survived a Gestapo prison should be denied compensation for their suffering? The answer to these questions is an emphatic NO! 
It is time that Germany drop their reservations to paying compensation to all those who deserve it, regardless of income levels, regardless of the time spent enduring Nazi torture. All limitations should be dropped and each and every survivor, everywhere, regardless of their situation, should be provided with compensation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my good friends and distinguished colleagues, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Abraham. Our bill is rightfully entitled the `Innocent Spouse Tax Relief Act of 1998.' 
Mr. President, this bill will bring relief to innocent spouses, predominantly women, women who have been held responsible now for the tax liabilities incurred by their husbands. Merely because they happen to file a joint return, they then become held hostage and are liable in some cases. The Finance Committee, these past several weeks, has been holding hearings. 
On February 11, we held hearings on how the IRS administers the tax law after a divorce or separation. We had a number of women who came forward, women who related the most shocking tales of how they have been harassed, how they have been pursued for overdue tax debts, not that they incurred but that were incurred by their husbands. 
Under the current law, when a spouse signs a joint tax return, they become 100 percent responsible and liable for the other spouse's tax errors. This law exposes the innocent spouse to incredible financial obligations and emotional harm that follows thereafter. 
Let me give you the case in point that one person brought to our attention--Elizabeth Cockrell. Elizabeth came to this country from Canada at the age of 28, married a commodities broker. The marriage lasted 3 years. Now, 9 years after her divorce--9 years after her divorce--the Internal Revenue Service came to her and said her husband owed initially $100,000 because he had taken deductions with tax shelters that they disallowed. 
They came after her and they said, `You owe $500,000.' Now, here is this single person--no fault of her own--she was not involved in the business, had no knowledge that these tax shelters would be declared illegal, and 9 years after her marriage they come to her and say, `You owe $500,000.' Today, as a result of the interest and penalties that have accrued, she is now in debt to the tune, according to the IRS, of $650,000. 
Her only mistake was signing a joint return with her husband. Because she signed that return, she became individually responsible for 100 percent of that tax. Thus far, the IRS has only pursued her and not her husband and refuses to let her lawyer know that, if anything, they are going to pursue her husband. They have not been able to collect from him, so they go after her. She has a child, a job; she has community roots, so she is an easy target and they go after her. 
She has done nothing wrong. She has attempted to settle with the IRS, but they refuse. This is just one case. But, Mr. President, let me say that the General Accounting Office has estimated that there are 50,000 cases a year--every year 50,000 new cases come up. 
Every year we have innocent spouses who are being pursued, not because they have incurred a tax liability which they are responsible for but because of the arcane law they are held to, what we call joint and several liability. So they may have had no knowledge of the misdeeds or of the mistake, and they are held responsible. 
So Elizabeth Cockrell represents what is taking place repeatedly. Now we have literally hundreds of thousands of women who are being pursued by the Internal Revenue Service whose husbands or spouses may have left owing the IRS moneys. And now they have multiplied, in the case of Elizabeth Cockrell where her husband, former husband, initially owed $100,000, and he is now being pursued, and it is up to $650,000. Next year it will rise. 
So these are not nameless and faceless people; these are people, and 90 percent of them are women. Tremendous hardship. Our bill will say clearly that a person can only be held liable for the income that he or she has earned, and the failure to report properly, yes, they will be held liable, but not an innocent spouse. 
Mr. President, the American Bar Association has recommended this legislation and, indeed, has worked with myself and Senator Graham--I see my colleague from Florida who has cosponsored this along with Senator Moynihan--and they have recommended this change. They do not recommend changes in the tax laws easily. They recognize that this is absolutely discriminatory. 
In addition, the National Taxpayers Union--300,000 members--they have recommended this legislation. It is long overdue. 
Last, but not least, we have hundreds of thousands of people today, mostly women--90 percent of them are women--who are being pursued improperly. The Internal Revenue Service has no choice, given the way the legislation now exists. Our bill would free these people from this unfair obligation which is now being thrust upon them. The hundreds of thousands of working women who are now being pursued unfairly, not because they have incurred any tax liability on their own, but simply because they were married and they were the innocent spouse of someone who filed incorrectly, improperly, or withheld information that they were not aware of.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important, bipartisan proposal to improve fairness. 
We talk about fairness. I do not know when we are going to change the overall IRS Code, et cetera, but this certainly will restore confidence among taxpayers and give desperately needed relief to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of working moms out there who are now being pursued improperly.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague, Senator Robert Torricelli from New Jersey, to submit a resolution which calls upon the President to support the inclusion of Italy as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council in any future expansion of that body. Anyone who is aware of the indispensable aide Italy has offered in the past and promises to continue providing in the future would share this view. I would like to now note just a few of Italy's numerous accomplishments with the United Nations and the Security Council in order to highlight the reasons why I believe Italy should be invited to join the United Nations Security Council. 
Italy's peace-keeping efforts in the past have been invaluable in aiding the United Nations on numerous fronts. It organized and led a multi-national peace enforcement operation in Albania last spring under United Nations authority to restore order and organize democratic elections. It provided the second largest United Nations troop contingent in Somalia. In 1983 Italy joined the United States in a multilateral force to bring peace and stability to Lebanon, and is still participating in the ongoing United Nations peacekeeping force there. Italy was also essential in brokering the peace settlement in Mozambique, as well as leading the peacekeeping forces that implemented it. Finally, Italy plays a key role in hosting the sole United Nations logistical base supporting peacekeeping operations worldwide at Brindisi on the Adriatic. 
Moreover, Italy's strategic location in the Mediterranean has made it an indispensable partner in security operations in a multitude of international regions. As such, Italy's assistance has been crucial in hosting air bases from which the United States and its NATO partners have conducted air operations over the former Yugoslavia. Italy has the world's fifth largest economy, and will this year increase its monetary contributions to 5.4% of that sum, becoming the United Nation's fifth largest assessed contributor. It's contribution has surpassed that of Britain, Russia, and China, three permanent members of the Security Council. In addition, with an estimated contribution of $72 million in peace-keeping operations for the upcoming year, Italy's efforts in financial aid to the United Nations have also been tremendous. 
As one of our closest allies and strategic partners in the world community, Italy continues to be an asset to the United Nation's peace keeping efforts, and is thus not only worthy, but essential in continued progress toward the Security Council's goals. I thus urge the President to oppose any reorganization plan for the expansion of the Security Council which does not include Italy, and strongly encourage Italy's inclusion as a permanent member if such an expansion is to take place.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to leave the door to NATO open. Others, whose wisdom I respect, have come before the Senate to urge that we legislatively adopt a policy that would close the door to NATO membership to candidate countries, regardless of their qualifications. While the reasons advanced in support of that view carry weight, I do not believe that they outweigh the reasons for leaving the door open. 
Last year, as Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I chaired a series of hearings at which ambassadors of candidate countries appeared and testified concerning their respective countries' reasons and qualifications for joining NATO. At the end of that series of hearings, we issued a report urging that Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, and Slovenia be included in the first round of NATO expansion. Since that time, ten months ago, I believe that subsequent developments have supported strongly the conclusion that we drew in favor of NATO expansion. 
Now, the Senate is close to voting on the admission of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I intend to vote for expansion. These countries have each proven that they share our democratic and free enterprise values, that they want to be members of NATO, and that they are willing to join us in bearing the burdens that Alliance membership imposes. 
Mr. President, I want to take particular note that each of these countries, contrary to the positions taken by some of our allies of longer standing, have not hesitated to publicly state their support for our effort to persuade, and if necessary, compel Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions adopted after Iraq's unprovoked military aggression against Kuwait. One of the tests of alliance is the political will to take risks for the common good of the group. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary have met this test. 
As I stated earlier, our recommendation ten months ago was that Slovenia and Romania be included in the first group of countries considered for NATO membership. That did not happen. But neither Slovenia nor Romania recoiled from their rejection by NATO. In fact, both have persisted in policies readying their countries and their militaries for NATO membership, and have been vocally enthusiastic about the prospect. 
On July 8th, 1997, the `Madrid Declaration on Euro-Atlantic Security and Cooperation' was issued by the Heads of State and Government of NATO. Paragraph 8 of the Madrid Declaration stated that, and I quote:  
We reaffirm that NATO remains open to new members under Article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Alliance will continue to welcome new members in a position to further principles of the Treaty and contribute to security in the Euro-Atlantic area. The Alliance expects to extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership, and as NATO determines that the inclusion of these nations would serve the overall political and strategic interests of the Alliance and that the inclusion would enhance overall European security and stability. To give substance to this commitment, NATO will maintain an active relationship with those nations that have expressed an interest in NATO membership as well as those who may wish to seek membership in the future. Those nations that have previously expressed an interest in becoming NATO members but that were not invited to begin accession talks today will remain under consideration for future membership. The considerations set forth in our 1995 Study on NATO Enlargement will continue to apply with regard to future aspirants, regardless of their geographic location. No European democratic country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the Treaty will be excluded from consideration. Furthermore, in order to enhance overall security and stability in Europe, further steps in the ongoing enlargement process of the Alliance should balance the security concerns of all Allies. 
Mr. President, those words sound like a promise to me. Perhaps more importantly, they recognized a central fact. That fact is that by setting an artificial limit to NATO enlargement, we are drawing a new dividing line across Europe. Whether that line is geographic or temporal does not matter. When such a line is drawn, in the present environment it creates a gray area. History teaches us that gray areas are not solutions, they are problems waiting to happen. 
Other candidate NATO members do not want to be consigned to gray areas. They know that bad things happen to small countries left alone in gray areas. We know that we do not want to create situations that invite anti-democratic forces to grow and plan and act. 
At the Commission, we pay very close attention to human rights concerns in Europe. Our experience with NATO enlargement has been that the requirements countries must meet for consideration for NATO membership have very strongly influenced their domestic politics. While all human rights problems are not resolved, most of them are. Also, disputes between ethnic majority and minority groups are given prominence and progress is made toward solutions. Some of these problems have existed for centuries and, in my view, would have continued unaddressed but for the 
necessity each country has seen to `put its house in order' before applying for NATO membership. 
Moreover, international cross-border disputes that in the past have triggered at least hostility if not military conflict have been formally resolved, with the support of democratic majorities in the countries involved. This is not a trivial development in a part of the world where such disputes have given repeated rise to brutal conflicts that are incomprehensible to most Americans. 
For these reasons, it is vitally important that the door to NATO membership not be closed, especially not by the United States. Proponents argue that a `delay' is necessary as a period of consolidation of the Alliance, and for the Russians to accommodate themselves to the changed European landscape. 
I believe that `delay' in this case could become denial, with very grave consequences to those nations shut out by such a decision. Moreover, Russia is one of the nations I have in mind when I make this statement. Regardless of rhetoric by Russian Communists like Zhirinovsky, and others of the so-called `red-brown' extreme nationalist fringe, Russia itself has a very real interest in NATO expansion. And that interest is not in blocking, delaying, or limiting it. 
In fact, to the extent that NATO expansion is delayed or limited, the radical forces in Russia's political equation will be strengthened. For the United States to provide them with a victory they could not have secured by any other means would be a terrible mistake. Radical forces in Russia cannot be appeased by throwing them a bone. All it does is embolden them and add to their power, allowing them to say to Russian voters, `See what we can do, and we are not yet in charge of the government.' Our policy should be to do what is best for us, and that means to give hope, support and security to small states trying to become democratic capitalist members of the Western community, and treat anti-democratic forces with implacable opposition. 
Mr. President, the citizens of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia were given hope when we refused for the duration of the Cold War to recognize their forcible and illegal incorporation into the Soviet Union. Ukraine is now a NATO `Partner for Peace.' The President of Bulgaria, Petar Stoyanov, was here recently, seeing President Clinton to make the case that Bulgaria is a credible candidate for NATO membership. The people of these countries do not deserve to have the door to NATO slammed shut on their fingers. 
While some states with serious human rights and democratization problems do not look like possible NATO members at any time in the near future, as states around them make major efforts to put their domestic and international affairs in order to quality for membership, this has an influence and an impact. If we do as we have pledged, and allow candidate countries to join when they demonstrate that they meet the 
qualifications, those who choose not to make the effort will be more and more isolated. This process will undermine and weaken anti-democratic forces that have stirred back to life in some former Warsaw Pact states after the fall of Communism. 
I want to make one other point. When the Commission issued its report, I reminded the Senate that NATO is a military alliance. A look at the map will refresh my colleagues' understanding of the need to include Romania and Slovenia in the next round of expansion. After Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic are admitted, we will have an Alliance with a member, Hungary, which lacks a land corridor connecting it with other Alliance members. This is a weakness of major importance, one whose significance can only be magnified if we artificially `delay' accession of other qualified candidates. This point also focuses attention on Bulgaria's desire to become, when it is qualified, an Alliance member. 
The Washington Post's Wednesday, February 11, 1998 edition contains an editorial and a separate article that support my perspective on this issue. The editorial entitled `Opening NATO's Door,' states that, and I quote: 
There is a moral heart to the case for enlargement, and it is to bind the democracies, refreshing the old, strengthening the new. The first three candidates have demonstrated they are committed to assuming alliance responsibilities. Their accession would, as Secretary of State Albright put it Monday, `make us all safer by expanding the area of Europe where wars do not happen.' The resulting increments of stability would benefit not only NATO members but the Russians, who remain opposed to the development but are unable to stop it. 
The serious American objection to enlargement comes from strategists who fear the political and military dilution of an alliance once focused laser-like on territorial defense against a single dangerous foe. These strategists would have the European Union do the main work of easing the path of the new democracies, leaving NATO to deal with a still-problematic Russia and its huge residual nuclear resource. But the would leave the now-free pieces of the old Soviet empire marooned in strategic ambiguity. The new democracies need better and deserve it. 
The article, entitled `NATO Candidates Urge Senators to Back Expansion,' by Edward Walsh, is also important. It quotes the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary as supporting the continued expansion of NATO when other candidate states are ready to join. Here is the description of what they said, and I quote:  
Geremek said other Central and Eastern European countries that hope to join NATO were disappointed to be left out of the first proposed expansion round but `they are happy that the expansion will take place and feel it will increase their security.' 
Enacting legislation requiring a three- to five-year wait before others could join NATO, as some have suggested, would send a discouraging message to these countries, the officials argued. `The purpose of the enlargement is to diminish the dividing lines [in Europe], not to create new lines of division between the new members of NATO and those who stay outside,' Kovacs said.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan to introduce the `Women's Rights National Historic Trail Act' which authorizes that the Secretary of the Interior study alternatives for establishing a national historic trail to commemorate and interpret the history of women's rights. New York has that history. 
In 1848, despite social, legal and economic constraints, the action of several women from New York led to a movement that would eventually provide freedom to women across this country and for generations to come. 
In Seneca Falls, 1848, the first Women's Rights Convention was held leading the way for the 19th Amendment which granted women the right to vote. On July 19th, the first day of the two day convention, the Declaration of Sentiments was read at the convention promoting the right to vote, the right for a woman to attain a higher education, the right to own property and the right to retain one's own wages--some of the most fundamental principles of our democracy. As stated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the leaders of the convention, `We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.' 
The other leaders of the Convention including Lucretia Mott, Jane Hunt, Ann M'Clintock and Martha Wright began the movement to fulfill the freedom of Americans by changing the treatment of women in American society. 
I support the designation of a corridor commemorating the triumphs of these and other women, and believe that the Buffalo-Boston trail deserves serious consideration. Areas like Seneca Falls, where we can find the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House, and her church, the Old Trinity Church, I believe, should be part of the historical trail for women's history. Other areas in New York have a tremendous historical significance for women's rights including: the Susan B. Anthony House, voting site and gravesite in Rochester and the M'Clintock House where the idea of a convention was conceived and the Declaration of Sentiments was written. 
This bill only requires the Secretary to study the alternatives available to him and does not dictate where that commemoration occurs. But the events that occurred the summer of 1848 should be remembered and treated as part of a historical connection. The importance of Seneca Falls is key in the advancement of the rights of women in our nation and that is why I have also joined with Senator Moynihan in June 1997 to introduce a S. Con. Res. 35, urging the U.S. Postal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the first Women's Right Convention. 
I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan in this effort to preserve the historical significance of women's rights in New York and I urge my colleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this legislation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to repeal a provision of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that is particularly onerous and unfair to New York's and our nation's hospitals. The provision is one that expands the definition of a Medicare transfer and it is inherently counterintuitive to assuring the delivery of appropriate health care services to patients. 
As many of my colleagues might recall, I was actively involved during the Senate's debate of the BBA in fighting for the elimination of the transfer provision. I thought then, and I still believe now that it is bad health care policy that runs counter to the mission that we should be advocating when we make policy: to encourage the providers of health care in our communities to provide the most appropriate care for the good of their patients. Along with my colleague Senator Dodd, last year, we were able to mitigate the impact of the original transfer provision in the final BBA that was enacted. Unfortunately, we were not able to eliminate it from the BBA and that is why I am here today, offering legislation to finish the job we started last summer. 
Included in the BBA was a provision that would expand the definition of a Medicare acute care transfer to include discharges to any rehabilitation or psychiatric hospital, nursing home or home health agency. This policy is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, 1998, for 10 Medicare hospital procedures that will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. What this means for hospitals that transfer patients is that the hospital would no longer get paid the appropriate payment (a DRG payment)--they would instead get paid a lesser amount--just because the patient was discharged to receive a more appropriate level of care. This policy would only apply for patients that are transferred in under the average length of stay. 
Let me give you an example: a patient goes into the hospital for one of the 10 designated procedures, for example, a hip operation, which has an average length of stay of 10 days. At 7 days, the patient's doctor wants to transfer him to a rehabilitation hospital to continue his recovery. This is where the transfer policy would have an effect: the hospital that discharged him would no longer receive the payment that is due to them--the DRG payment. Instead, they would receive a lesser per diem payment, merely because the patient was discharged to receive a more appropriate, cost effective level of care. 
Let me spend a moment here talking about the hospital payment system. The DRG system was put into place by Congress to create the proper incentives for providing an appropriate level of care for patients. It is a system that is built on average: patient cases that have higher lengths of stay are `underpaid' and cases that have lower than average lengths of stay are `overpaid' because, regardless of the length of stay, hospitals get the same payment. The new transfer policy would begin a serious erosion of the DRG system and, as a result, create the wrong incentives for hospitals. Hospitals that are faced with receiving a lesser payment for providing the appropriate care for a patient, will undoubtedly change their behavior: they will end up keeping a patient in the hospital longer--until the average length of stay is reached, and then transfer the patient to a post-acute care facility. As a result, the transfer policy creates a disincentive for hospitals to efficiently provide the most appropriate level of care for their patients. 
The transfer policy is not necessary. Patients that use post-acute care services tend to have more complicated health care needs and longer hospital stays than those patients that don't use post-acute care. For this reason, the transfer policy does not address a problem in the Medicare system that needs fixing. Even the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission rejected this policy change because they believed it was bad health care policy and that it provided the wrong incentives for a hospital prospective payment system. 
It also creates billing documents for our hospitals who would be held responsible for the future actions of former patients. This sets up our hospitals for future allegations of fraud. For example, a hospital discharges a patient, who goes home from the hospital, expecting to be cared for by a family member. Suddenly, the family member becomes ill and unexpectedly cannot care for a patient. The patient's doctor calls the local home health care agency, who now sends a nurse out to the patient's home for 3 weeks of home care. The hospital has no knowledge of this and will bill Medicare for the full DRG because it believed that the patient was discharged and at home recovering. The hospital is unaware of actions of the patient and therefore would have no reason to bill the Medicare program differently. The government later could cite the hospital for fraud because they billed the Medicare program improperly. Hospitals are faced with the impossible and untenable task of tracking the future actions of patients that left their care. 
Repeal of the transfer policy is the only way to right a very misguided policy that was adopted last year. I urge my colleagues to support legislation that will eliminate a provision of the BBA that is bad health policy and disruptive to a system that aims to assure that patients receive the right care in the most appropriate setting.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, in 1996, one violent crime was committed every nineteen seconds in the United States. According to the Uniform Crime Reports, firearms were the weapons used in 29% of all murders, robberies and aggravated assaults, collectively, that year. When a crime occurs, no matter what the crime or the weapons used, the first action taken is to call the police. Law enforcement rushes to the rescue, risking their own lives in the process. 
It is imperative that we do all we can to assist the police in handling these volatile situations. That is why I join with Senators Campbell and Leahy in introducing the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act--a bill that will provide funding for equipment that is critical to preserve the lives of our law enforcement. The `equipment' of which I speak is a bullet proof vest. Under this bill, the federal government will pay half the cost for the purchase of armor vests for a State and local law enforcement. 
This bill promotes the purchases of these life-saving vests. The need for them is proven over and over again. Nationwide, the FBI estimates that nearly one third of the 1,182 law enforcement officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 would be alive if they had worn a bullet proof vest. 
Just this past December, Rochester, New York was rocked by the shooting of three police officers. Rochester Police Officers Mark G. Dibelka and Thomas DiFante were both shot in the chest and Sgt. Michael Kozak was shot in the arm. All three men lived --thanks to the bulletproof vests. These heroes will live to see the judicial process at work against the criminal charged with three counts of first degree attempted murder. Due to the bullet proof vests, we are able to wish these men a speedy recovery. 
In New York City, the lives of two officers were saved with a bulletproof vest. A convicted drug dealer is accused of shooting two officers, firing three shots at Detective Wafkey Salem in the chest and shot at Detective Lourdes Gonzalez' shoulder. These officers lived to tell their stories. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Protection Act of 1998 authorizes $25 million of federal funds to be matched with State and localities funds for the purchase of armor vests. Any agent or officer that prevents, detects or investigates crimes, or supervises sentenced offenders, will be able to receive a bulletproof vest with the assistance of this grant--that includes law enforcement and correction officers. 
Special attention is paid to rural areas, with at least 50% of the funds available to jurisdictions with populations of 100,000 or less. Each state would receive a minimum of .75% of the total federal funds, including Puerto Rico. The bill also includes a maximum of 5% that can be drawn to each state, including the grantees of that state. The only restriction is that the armor vests are not made by prison labor, a very reasonable requirement, especially in light of the nature of the life-saving equipment. This legislation also recognizes that the equipment purchased with federal assistance should be made in the United States. 
Law enforcement officers risk their lives for people, and we owe it to them to make sure the risks are at a minimum. We owe it to the men and women who go to work everyday and have no idea what dangerous situation awaits them--and we owe it to their families. This bill should be passed, swiftly and, I hope, with the full support of the Senate.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, consistent with the greatest traditions of athletic competition, the 1997 Dover High School football team became the first in Dutchess County history to earn the high honor of New York State Champion. Rolling to victory after victory, their perfect season culminated in a spectacular double-overtime triumph over Christian Brothers Academy of Syracuse. 
While the victories they gained were as a team of 31 dedicated scholar-athletes, they did not travel that road to victory alone. Behind them all the way were their parents, their classmates and the entire community. Guiding them and offering encouragement in difficult times while challenging them to be the best were their coaches: Bill Broggy, Chris Lounsbury, John Thorpe, Bill Peel, Paul Kenny and Israel Lorimer. 
Their skill on the field, their refusal to give up and their commitment to excellence have brought honor and distinction not only to the Dover Dragons, but to all of Section 1. In addition to their undefeated season and many memories, they have developed skills that will be with them long after their playing days are over. The dedication they displayed through countless hours of practice, their sense of teamwork, and the ability to rise to a challenge will serve them well as they continue to grow not only as athletes, but as human beings. 
Leading up to the championship game on November 28, 1997, the players, coaches, parents, and so many fans traveled with hope and pride to play and watch the ultimate game. Win or lose, the Dover Dragons had made it all the way to the New York State Championship at the Carrier Dome. Facing a tough hometown team, the Dover Dragons never backed down and never forgot what brought them to the contest. Although facing defeat in the fourth quarter, the Dragons tapped their collective strength and battled back through two overtimes to earn the title of New York State Champion. This championship win represented an entire season of tenacity, commitment, and dedication to excellence. 
For so many of our young men and women, the athletic fields are a place to be challenged, a place to succeed, a place to learn the value of teamwork and loyalty. The Dover Dragons have learned these lessons well, and as they continue to celebrate their New York State Championship, I salute them: 
The 1997 Dover High School Football Dragons: Tim Jones, Kurt Abrams, John Greiner, Eric Bosley, George Morfea, Chris Maglin, Willie Peel, Spencer Harby, Jeff Aubry, Christian Harby, Chris Barto, Rob Schaus, Chris Zabowski, Shane Barto, Justin Agrella, Luis Jusino, Frank Cawley, Steve Meilleur, Ed Pisano, Matt Judson, Nick Savarese, John Hammond, Rick Rappazzo, Jeff Acken, Pat Hearn, John Locke, Justin Cole, Justin Brown, Matt Light, Nate Davis, Garett Yeno.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his leadership on this most important issue. I believe that education is the most important issue facing our country. 
We have focused a majority of our attention on the need to give assistance to those of our students who are college bound, and that is important. We have done, I think, a good job in expanding, for example, the Pell grants to take in nearly 300,000 students, and I voted for that. We have increased the amounts of those grants substantially, from about $2,400 to $3,000 and I support that. And we worked to create educational savings accounts, and I think that is important, Madam President. 
But I think it is time that we look at our elementary schools and our high schools, because one in five third-graders across New York State could not read with comprehension even the easiest connected sentences and paragraphs, according to the New York State Department of Education. We have heard that 40 percent of the children in some of our school districts are reading below grade level and are below grade level in math. 50 percent-plus of the students in some of our school districts are dropping out of school, including here in the Nation's Capital. What is going to happen to those children who are dropping out? How can they compete? What jobs are they going to hold? What will happen to society if this continues? 
Let me say that last night the President talked about a number of issues. One of those issues he talked about was the need to hire more teachers. Let me tell you that I believe we need more teachers in the classrooms. We should empower, by way of making moneys available, the local districts to do exactly that. I am going to work with whoever it is--the President, this administration, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--to do exactly that. 
The President also called for greater accountability in education, and I believe that's important. He said students must be more accountable for their performance, that we should not have social promotion. That is true. Unfortunately, we didn't hear one word about making teachers accountable also. One of the things that this bill, the B.O.O.K.S. Act, does is make available funds for accountability. You can't have our kids learning if the people teaching them do not meet performance standards. We must have competency testing so that we know math teachers do understand basic math and that they can teach it. We have to have some system of evaluating, and we should give the school districts that ability. It is not that we should say what test they should give, but we should empower the local districts and the parents to have a choice.

Mr. DAMATO. Most of our teachers, I believe, Mr. President, do a great job and are dedicated and hard-working. Unfortunately, there is no financial reward for those great teachers. I think we need merit pay. That is one of the things that we encourage in this legislation, which offers better opportunities for our kids. 
We need major reform, not just tinkering at the edges of the problem. 
Let me touch on that which, in many cases, brings about a hue and cry not from the parents, but from those who want to protect the status quo, the teachers' union. 
By perpetuating the status quo, too many of our children are falling by the wayside--they are not making it. I am talking about a system that many of my colleagues quake when we bring the issue up, and that is called accountability and seeing to it that teachers don't have lifetime tenure. I think our kids are entitled 
to have teachers who make a difference just like the teachers I had in grade school who created magic in the classroom. 
Those teachers exist today. Let's understand that. I think the vast majority of our public school teachers are dedicated, work hard, do a good job, and they should be rewarded with merit pay. 
But, by gosh, let's not be afraid to say there should be accountability as well with teacher competency tests and ending a system where teachers, in essence, in too many of our schools and too many of our States, have what is likened to lifetime tenure. After 3 years, it becomes virtually impossible to remove those who are not doing the job. I will give you an example from New York State. Last year, only seven out of 200,000 teachers were removed. Seven. It has become virtually impossible. And it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring this type of action. 
Now, Mr. President, I am not suggesting that we jeopardize those good teachers who are doing the job or that we create some arbitrary standards. I am suggesting that we have some review, some system to evaluate performance so that nobody has what is, in essence, lifetime tenure regardless of the job the person is doing. 
The education of our children is too important. Those who teach our children must be competent in these subjects, that is why we need competency testing for all teachers. Our children deserve nothing less. 
Let me point to just one other area before I conclude my remarks, and that is school safety. My gosh, if we have children in our public schools that say it is dangerous and they feel safer in their neighborhoods than going from one class to another, what more do we need? If we don't have schools as a safe haven, creating the environment where our children can learn in that safe haven, that oasis of learning, then how can the best teacher do the job? So we have to be able to fast-track violent, disruptive students out of the school. You cannot suggest that public education has ever said that even violent, disruptive juveniles have a right to stay in school no matter what their conduct. That is unfortunately the case in too many areas. I will tell you that the 1,116 schools in New York City reported 22,000 incidents in 1996-97, including nearly 5,000 person-related incidents. It becomes impossible to have serious learning in the classroom. 
Last but not least, let me just touch on one aspect that I think is so important. Why should we have a plethora of Federal programs that serve cross-purposes, when we can take that money and establish education block grants. Somehow bureaucrats have planted in the minds of many of our parents and local officials that they are going to lose money. 
What we call for in this bill is saying that we are going to give you the same amount of money, and, in fact, we will actually give you more money. In title II of the BOOKS Act, States would receive funds through block grants, which can be used for educational needs that the local communities and school boards think are important--not that Washington mandates. So they are going to get more money. In addition, they are going to get a lot more money because 95 percent of those funds must reach the local schools in the classrooms and cannot be used for administrative expenses. We cannot have 15 to as high as 25 and 30 percent of the money being used for administrative overhead. The money is not reaching the kids. 
I might give one example. Senator Gorton's amendment along these lines last year would have sent an additional $670 million to local school districts. But we have the bureaucrats in Washington who are opposed to that. They want to keep these ties. That is an employment center as opposed to becoming an educational opportunity. So $670 million more could go to the school districts. And by the way, that hires 26,000 teachers. So when our President says, `we want to hire 100,000,' here is a way. If we were to adopt the block grant proposal, and some amendments to it, we could hire as many as 26,000 teachers at the local districts without raising one additional penny. My gosh, that's over a quarter of the number that the President talked about, with no 
increase in taxes. It just means using the resources we have and empowering our parents and the local school districts to make these choices. 
Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott, and the occupant of the Chair, Senator Coats, for being leaders in this area. We have to do better for our children, not just tinkering at the edges. 
By the way, why should we be afraid of the teachers' unions? We should encourage them to work with us. It should not be a battle against them. Notwithstanding that I have been critical of their status quo position and their opposition to basic, good, fundamental reform, this should be a fight for our children, to give our kids a better education. I would hope that the Members and all of the teachers would join and be in favor of this and work together. We can do better and we must do better because our children are entitled to that. 
So, Mr. President, I thank you for your leadership. I thank Senator Coverdell and my colleagues. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the House of Representatives on passage of S.1564, `The Holocaust Victims Redress Act.' 
The bill was passed by the Senate on November 13, 1997 and was referred back to the House where it was originally introduced by my colleagues, the Chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Jim Leach, and Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Rep. Ben Gilman. I am very pleased that we have been able to work together to pass this important legislation enabling the correction of a horrible injustice after the war. Now, needy survivors can obtain some measure of justice and dignity. 
Mr. President, this important bill contains two main provisions. First, the bill authorizes $25 million for a U.S. donation to the fund established by the United States and the United Kingdom at the London Conference on Nazi Gold in December. Second, the bill authorizes $5 million for research into the issue and translation of foreign language documents coming from this effort. The Administration has been fully supportive of this effort. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, particularly, has played a vital role in this effort and without him we would not be where we are today on the issue. 
Regarding the $5 million authorized in the bill for research, it is my strong belief that the management of these funds should be granted to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. This museum is the one organization uniquely capable of conducting research like this, research that is a core function of its mission. The Museum, I might add, has been an invaluable aid to the Banking Committee during our on-going inquiry into the disposition of Holocaust-era assets by Swiss banks from before, during and after the Holocaust. Accordingly, I can think of no better group to manage the research funding from this bill than the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
Mr. President, I again want to thank my colleagues for their help in obtaining passage for this important bill. If we are going to try to obtain justice for victims of the Holocaust. While much more needs to be done on this issue, this is an important measure in this long overdue effort.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation along with my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, that will help guarantee that one of our Nation's most important estuaries is no longer used as a dumping ground for polluted dredged material. Long Island Sound is a spectacular body of water located between Long Island, New York and the State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, past dumping of dredged material of questionable environmental impact has occurred in the sound. It is high time that Congress put an end to any future, willful pollution of the sound. 
The legislation that we are introducing today will prevent any individual of any government agency from randomly dumping sediments into the ecologically sensitive sound. Specifically, the legislation prevents all sediments that contain any constituents prohibited as other than trace contaminants, as defined by federal regulations, from being dumped into either Long Island Sound or Block Island Sound. Exceptions to the act can be made only in circumstances where the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the material will not cause undesirable effects to the environment of marine life. 
In the fall of 1995, the U.S. Navy dumped over 1 million cubic yards of dredged material from the Thames River into the New London dump site located in the sound. Independent tests of 
that sediment indicated that contaminants were present in that dredged material that now lies at the bottom of the sound's New London dump site--contaminants such as dioxin, cadmium, pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PCB's, and mercury. Right now, there is a question as to the long-term impact this material will have on the aquatic life and the environment in that area of the ocean. Such concerns should not have to occur. It has taken years to come as far as we have in cleaning up Long Island Sound--we should not jeopardize those gains by routinely allowing the dumping of polluted sediments in these waters. 
Vast amounts of federal, state, and local funds have been spent in the State of New York in the last quarter century combating pollution in the sound. However, at times over the last 25 years, we have looked the other way when it comes to dumping in the sound. Such actions are counter-productive in our efforts to restore the sound for recreational activities such as swimming and boating as well as the economic benefits of sportfishing and the shellfish industry--all of which bring more than $5.5 billion to the region each year. 
New Yorkers realize the importance of the sound and are stepping up their efforts to make sure it is cleaned up. New York voters approved an environmental bond initiative that, among other things, commits $200 million for sewage treatment plant upgrades, habitat restoration, and nonpoint source pollution controls on Long Island Sound. New York is doing its part; it is time now to get the support of the federal government. With the actions taken by New York, and with the passage of the legislation Senator Moynihan and I are introducing, I am confident that Long Island Sound will move steadily forward on the road to recovery. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bill, and I encourage its swift passage in the Senate.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States with respect to shadow mask steel. Shadow mask steel, a vital component of color television picture tubes and computer video monitors, is used to produce `shadow masks' which prevent image distortion on the viewing screens of televisions and computer video monitors. Unfortunately, neither shadow mask steel, nor any viable substitute, is produced within the United States. Therefore, United States shadow mask producers must import this product from steel producers in Japan and Germany. 
Domestic shadow mask production faces a difficult challenge to stay competitive in today's shadow mask market. Competition from foreign shadow masks is increasing as foreign manufacturers aggressively pursue the U.S. market. In addition, color picture tube and computer video monitor manufacturers are increasing their efforts to reduce production costs due to increased competition in the television and computer markets. 
These factors reinforce the vital need for competitively-priced component materials, such as shadow masks. Eliminating the duty on shadow mask steel, a product that is already subject to a gradual tariff elimination schedule, would be an important step toward enabling domestic manufacturers to remain competitive in the global market. 
Major U.S. television picture tube and computer video monitor manufacturers that employ thousands of workers throughout the United States rely on a consistent supply of domestically-produced shadow masks. If such companies were unable to count on such a supply, we run the risk of supplanting domestic production of this product with imported shadow masks from foreign competitors, resulting in higher costs and delivery uncertainties associated with purchasing shadow mask imports. 
Such increased costs and uncertainty would certainly result in reduced competitiveness of U.S. television picture tube and computer video monitor manufacturers vis--vis foreign manufacturers. Reduced competitiveness could lead to the transfer of existing U.S. manufacturing operations abroad, and/or the closing of U.S. facilities, resulting in the loss of thousands of actual and potential U.S. jobs in the television and computer manufacturing industries.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I note that the Italian Hospital Society is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a dinner and awards presentation on Sunday, November 16th. It is a most notable organization guided by compassion and philanthropy to assist the hospital and health services of Italian communities in New York. 
This year's ceremonies will salute four eminent Italian-Americans who have brought the hopes of the Italian Hospital Society closer to reality. I am especially gratified that the committee honors a doctor, a businessman, a union leader, and the principle inspiration of my life, my mamma. 
I can speak with particular knowledge and delight about Mamma, known to the public as Antoinette Cioffari D'Amato. She was born and grew up in Brooklyn, the daughter of Italian-American parents. In growing up as her child, I was able to see the qualities, character and enthusiasm for life and for family which the society salutes in her public life. It was she who inspired confidence, exercised discipline and demanded the pursuit of education. It was she who was the foundation for responsibility to the community and for civic involvement. 
In her marriage of 61 years to my father, Armand, a teacher and son of Italian-American parents, she was a prototypical `mamma'--cooking, cleaning, exhorting, reprimanding and loving her three children, Alfonse, Armand, and Joanne. During World War II, while my father was in the Army, she worked in a defense plant. As part of the emigration from Brooklyn to Long Island, the D'Amato family moved to Island Park where she and Dad continue to reside. Both still work in the insurance brokerage which has been the family business for over 60 years. 
It was my political campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1980 that brought Mamma and her many talents to a wider audience. The advertisements she made for my campaign made me a winner. Ever since she has been unstinting as an active and enthusiastic citizen of New York. She has had a special interest in affordable housing services for older citizens through her membership on the board of the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens Inc. She is a television celebrity and the author of her own cookbook--`Cooking and Canning with Mamma D'Amato.' 
I commend the Italian Hospital Society for the honor they give my mother for her public participation; but, for all the lessons and love of the private Antoinette Cioffari D'Amato, only a hug and a kiss are the proper awards.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss one important health care initiative in New York State. This worthy project is the Montefiore Medical Center and it is located in the Bronx section of New York City. 
The Montefiore Medical Center system, established over 100 years ago, is an integrated health delivery system with two acute care hospitals providing access to over 1,000 beds, 30 community-based primary care centers, and a range of other outreach services operating in the Bronx and the surrounding communities. Through its extensive network, including comprehensive-care sites in some of the Nation's most economically deprived areas, Montefiore provides care to medically underserved residents. The Montefiore system provides nearly 20 percent of all inpatient acute care, and nearly 40 percent of all tertiary care required by Bronx residents, including over $50 million in uncompensated charity care annually. In addition, in partnership with the Children's Health Fund, Montefiore administers the Nation's largest medical program for homeless children. 
The Bronx is home to 400,000 children under age 21. In 1995, Montefiore conducted an extensive review of the health status of Bronx children and concluded that the overwhelming majority are at serious health risk, for reasons such as abuse, pediatric AIDS, lead poisoning, and asthma. In particular, asthma is the most serious health risk to Bronx children. Nearly one-third of births in the borough are to teenage mothers who receive no pre-natal care. As a result, the child hospitalization rate is 50 percent above the national average. 
Montefiore's study also demonstrated that a fundamental restructuring of its pediatric health care delivery system should be necessary to meet the growing challenge of providing services to these extremely at-risk children. Managed care is rapidly transforming how health care services are delivered in underserved communities. To remain viable in the evolving health care marketplace, Montefiore's child health treatment, prevention, and education services must be organized and efficiently coordinated. 
Montefiore has long been recognized as one of the Nation's premier pediatric research and training institutions, having trained a significant percentage of the country's pediatricians. In recent years, Montefiore has lost substantial numbers of pediatric specialists to more traditional children's hospitals which could have a dramatic impact on the numbers of physicians who practice in inner-city communities. To ease the competitive disadvantage and ensure its capacity to retain critically needed pediatric resources for the Bronx, Montefiore must consolidate pediatric specialists and specialty care in one location, a children's hospital. 
To meet the enormous challenge of providing high-quality, comprehensive services for Bronx children, Montefiore will develop the Montefiore Medical Center Child Health Network [CHN], an integrated system of family-centered care for families of all socio-economic levels. The CHN, organized around the core principal of providing enhanced access to high quality primary care, will offer a full complement of child health services. 
As the central institution of the CHN, the Montefiore Children's Hospital will feature 106 beds in age-appropriate units, state-of-the-art pediatric emergency and intensive care units, a full spectrum of tertiary subspecialties, including environmental sciences and behavioral pediatrics, a short-stay day hospital, support facilities and services for children and their families, including playrooms, school facilities, and a family resource center, and lastly, innovative communications technologies including a telemedicine consultation service and on-line teaching and tele-conferencing capabilities. 
Montefiore Medical Center has provided community services and community-based health care programs for over a century. It is uniquely qualified to implement an initiative as innovative and far reaching as the child health network. This initiative will strengthen and extend Montefiore's commitment to the Bronx community as a whole, and the children of the Bronx in particular. Through the centralization of its diverse services in this borough of New York City, the new Children's Hospital and its satellites will elevate the quality, scope, and accessibility of primary and specialty health care services available to children and their families.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider, and I trust pass, S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1997. The Homeowners Protection Act, which I introduced earlier this year, and the Banking Committee passed by a 16-to-1 vote, is truly important legislation. This bill will protect homebuyers from excessive mortgage insurance premiums for homebuyers. It is a great product of great deal of hard work by a number of the Banking Committee's members. As a result, the legislation contains the consumer protections of the original bill; at the same time, the bill will be less of a compliance burden for the businesses that are subject to the legislation. 
Mr. President, the substitute amendment that Senator Sarbanes and I will offer for Senate consideration is the result of a great deal of hard work by Members on both sides of the aisle. First, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague and friend from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, for his hard work on this issue. Senator Faircloth and his staff have worked tirelessly to help craft compromise language that encompasses real consumer protection without undue regulatory burden. I would also like to offer my thanks to ranking minority member Paul Sarbanes and the bill's cosponsors, Senator Dodd and Senator Bryan, for their continuous support. I truly appreciate their valuable input in preparing the floor amendment that we are considering today. Likewise, I would like to commend Senators Grams and Moseley-Braun for their successful handling of the lender paid mortgage insurance issue, and my friend from Utah, Senator Bennett, for helping to craft compromise language regarding class action liability. 
Once again, I would particularly like to thank Representative James Hansen (R-UT), who has been the leader in the House in the fight to address PMI abuses. 
Mr. President, by passing this bill we can remedy a market dysfunction--unnecessary private mortgage insurance premiums. These premiums are being paid by tens of thousands of American homeowners. Private mortgage insurance is typically required when a homebuyer cannot make the standard 
20-percent downpayment. For many creditworthy, cash-poor potential homebuyers, private mortgage insurance has been a blessing. Unfortunately, it can also become a curse. 
I will present just one example of this unfair practice. A homebuyer purchases a $100,000 home with a 30-year, fixed rate mortgage and a 10-percent downpayment. After 10 years and $3,500 in mortgage insurance premiums, it is likely that the homeowners would have a 20-percent equity stake in his or her home. At this time, private mortgage insurance is no longer necessary. However, if that homeowner is unaware of the right to cancel--as many are--and continues to pay for unnecessary insurance, he or she could spend an additional $7,000 in premiums over the life of the loan. And this is less costly than many of the horror stories we hear. In fact, private mortgage insurance rates average between $20 and $100 per month, meaning that some consumers are unknowingly paying from $240 to $1,200 a year for absolutely no reason. Situations like these are nothing less than a fleecing of the American homeowner. 
The private mortgage insurance industry extended coverage on nearly 900,000 of the approximately 4.4 million mortgages made for the purchase of single-family homes in 1995. At a Banking Committee hearing earlier this year, the spokesman for the private mortgage insurance industry stated that of the approximately 5 million homeowners repaying mortgages covered by PMI, 5 percent could be eligible for cancellation. That amounts to 250,000 hardworking families. And some estimates go much higher. 
In fact, according to a recent Washington Post article by Ken Harney: 
An eye-opening new estimate of the extent of the problem came last week when a Dallas-based loan portfolio analyst said he believes that as much as one-fifth of some lenders' mortgage portfolios consist of PMI-insured loans with equities that are greater than 20 percent of current market resale value. 
Mr. President, clearly, American homeowners, particularly middleclass and firsttime homeowners need our help--and I can say today that that help is on the way. The committee print enables homeowners to initiate cancellation when they have accumulated 20-percent equity. Otherwise, the general rule is that PMI must be automatically canceled at 22 percent. 
The bill also requires that all existing mortgagors who currently maintain PMI will receive an annual notice informing them that under certain circumstances their insurance may be canceled. The notice must include information to allow the homeowner to contact his or her servicer regarding cancellation requirements. New homebuyers will be informed of their cancellation rights at closing, and will be informed of their right under this law at closing and annually. 
Mr. President, let me state for the record: I am opposed to unnecessary and excessive government regulation. This bill accomplishes the goals of S. 318 without imposing excess regulation. Clearly, the Congress should allow the free market to resolve most problems. This bill is only needed because, due to the peculiar nature of the PMI market, the market has not remedied this problem. I am grateful for the cooperation of all the industries and consumer groups that have helped bring us to this point. 
Mr. President, the Homeowner's Protection Act is evidence of what this body can accomplish with hard work on a bipartisan basis. Currently, unnecessary PMI premiums are wrong--when this bill becomes law, they will be illegal. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill and to vote for its passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support immediate passage of the `Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act' (S. 562). This legislation contains essential provisions which are urgently required to protect our senior citizens from further exploitation by fraudulent operators who are manipulating the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) home equity conversion mortgage program. The bill also contains a number of housing and flood insurance program reauthorizations and technical corrections which are needed to ensure the effective and efficient continuation of existing programs. 
The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act, which I introduced on April 10, 1997, was originally passed by the Senate on April 25, 1997. It seeks to prevent unscrupulous middlemen, posing as `estate planners', from taking advantage of seniors by charging unnecessary and excessive fees to assist them in obtaining a home equity conversion mortgage. These predators have charged elderly homeowners fees ranging from 6 to 12 percent of the loan amount. Hundreds of very low-income seniors have been manipulated into paying several thousand dollars in return for ministerial and often meaningless services. HUD provides information on reverse mortgages at no charge. 
These abuses must be halted at once. This bill provides two important safeguards to stop such exploitation. First, it provides a requirement that the mortgagor has received a full disclosure of all costs of obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate planning, financial advice or other related services. Second, it clarifies that the HUD Secretary has authority to impose restrictions to ensure that the mortgagor is not charged any unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining a reverse mortgage. 
This legislation also provides temporary extensions of certain public and assisted housing policy reforms which have been previously extended in VA-HUD appropriations legislation since Fiscal Year 1996. An owner's right to prepay a Federal Housing Administration-insured multifamily mortgage, subject to certain conditions, is clarified. 
The bill reauthorizes several federally assisted multifamily rental housing programs under the jurisdiction of HUD and the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. Such extensions will assure that much needed rental programs for low-income families continue in an uninterrupted fashion. The National Flood Insurance Program, which is vital for our homeowners residing in floodplain and coastal areas, is also reauthorized. 
Last fall, Congress passed the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. The legislation presented before you today makes technical and conforming changes to ensure the effective implementation of that Act. 
I would like to commend Senator Connie Mack, Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, for his leadership in the development of this legislation. I applaud Senator Mack, Ranking Minority Member Paul Sarbanes and Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member John Kerry for their fine stewardship of housing and community development programs under the Banking Committee's jurisdiction. 
Mr. President, S. 562 should be law by now. By delaying action on the bill for 5 months, the House of Representatives has left our senior citizens unprotected and vulnerable to predatory practices--and for no reason other than to engage in parliamentary gamesmanship. Mr. President, I cannot condone this delay. I urge the House of Representatives to pass this bill, which now contains additional provisions the House has insisted upon. There is no opposition to this bill to my knowledge. 
I respectfully urge the Senate and the House of Representatives to grant passage of this bill before adjournment. It is imperative that we ensure that our nation's most vulnerable homeowners are no longer victimized. Without final passage of this bill, our very low-income elderly homeowners may continue to be preyed upon. I ask for immediate support of this vital legislation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Northern Ireland/Border Counties Free Trade, Development and Security Act. This legislation is a carbon copy of S. 1976, legislation that I introduced in the 104th Congress. Joining me as original cosponsors are my friends and colleagues, the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun and the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran. 
The Northern Ireland Free Trade, Development and Security Act reintroduced today will--by University of Ulster estimates, create 12,000 jobs within the twelve counties of Northern Ireland and the Border Counties. It will produce an additional $1.5 billion into that economy annually. The new jobs it will create will be targeted to those areas that need the most, areas where the current unemployment rate ranges between 30 percent and 50 percent, areas that have never felt the effects of real economic expansion or growth. Further, this legislation will provide those jobs and hope without any discernable impact upon our nations trade or budget deficit, as was the case with Gaza/West Bank legislation. This bill will operate in harmony with stated goals of the European Union, United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. It will additionally comport with the requirements of the World Trade Organization. 
Mr. President, the paradox of Northern Ireland is that she has given so much to other cultures and lands but has been incapable of fully reaping the rewards of her own peoples skills and strengths at home. The unfortunate reality is that as in the Republic of Ireland, a large majority of the North's highly educated and skilled younger generation has been forced to emigrate due to high unemployment levels which are as high as 70 percent in some areas. These disadvantaged areas are the ones which this legislation has been especially designed to target. Joint cooperation and joint economic development between the United States, Northern Ireland and the European Union will integrate the most distressed parts of Northern Ireland and the Border Counties into a dynamic economy that--while firmly rooted in the European Union--continues to expand and cement new trading relationships beneficial to all trading partners. 
Northern Ireland's peace process must move forward and the aspirations and goodwill of the vast majority of its citizens must be accompanied by hard work and endeavor. A more prosperous economy with more evenly spread and meaningful job opportunities can only serve to bridge the social and economic disparities that exist in this region. In conclusion this opportunity cannot be overlooked, after 25 years since the outbreak of the `troubles,' the people of Northern Ireland have suffered enough violence and depravity. Now it is time to embark on a rebuilding process that will give no chance to the terrorist but every chance to peace and reconciliation. 
Mr. President, it is time to roll up our sleeves and do something real and substantive for all the people of Northern Ireland. This legislation goes far beyond symbolic gestures and grand statements of concern. It will provide a real and solid foundation that the people of Northern Ireland can use to build that new and brighter future. This legislation represents the Senate's down payment on that future.

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation necessary to correct a problem faced by an important segment of the American exporting community, catalogue merchants. Catalogue merchants are multi-billion dollar export businesses in New York State and across the nation. Due to an anomaly in our customs law, some products sold by these merchants face double duties when the goods are returned to them by customers abroad. The bill I am introducing today seeks to correct this problem by making sure that duties are only assessed once--as the law intended--the first time a product comes into this country from abroad. 
If I may Mr. President, let me explain the problem by first telling you how the system is supposed to work. When a catalogue merchant imports a product directly from abroad, as the importer of record, he pays a duty on the product. Let's say the product is a pair of trousers from Taiwan. A merchant in the United States takes direct delivery of a pair of pants from a company in Taipei, and pays duties to the U.S. Treasury on the trousers when they enter the United States. The merchant then sells the pants to a customer in Montreal, Canada. But, the pants are the wrong size, and the customer returns the same pair of trousers directly to the catalogue merchant in the U.S. In that case, properly, is no duty paid on the returned trousers. After all, a duty was properly paid on the trousers when they were first imported into the U.S. That is how the law works when the catalogue merchant is also the official importer of record. 
Now, take the same situation, but add a broker here in the United States, (the way most catalogue merchants import merchandise into the United States) who is officially the importer of record. The trousers come into the United States from Taipei, but this time, instead of going directly to the merchant, they are imported by a U.S. distributer. The distributer, who is the importer of record, properly pays the duty on the pants, and then transfers the trousers to the catalogue merchant in the U.S. The catalogue merchant then sells the trousers to the customer in Montreal, who subsequently returns the trousers to the U.S. merchant (via a return clearinghouse in Canada, that is set up to ship returned products back to the U.S. in bulk). That is where the problem comes in. When the trousers come back to the United States (as part of a bulk shipment), duty has to be paid on the trousers a second time. Officially, that is because the catalogue merchant is not the original importer of record, and thus a second duty is assessed on the trousers. 
Clearly, this makes no sense. A second duty should not have to be paid on the same pair of trousers, just because the U.S. catalogue seller is not the original U.S. importer of record. What this amendment says, essentially, is that it doesn't matter who the original importer of record is; as long as the proper duty is paid when an article first enters the U.S., a duty is not assessed the second time the article enters the U.S., when it re-enters the U.S. as a sales return. 
The President may know that I have sought this change in law for more than a year, and it is my hope that when the Senate next turns to miscellaneous trade matters, this very minor provision can be included. The U.S. Customs Service has told importers that legislation is the only remedy to correct this anomaly. Furthermore, the measure should be deemed `revenue neutral' because importers can already avoid the double duty by simply shipping the returns back by (inefficiently) shipping the returns back to the U.S. individually rather than (efficiently) consolidating the shipments. 
This measure is a common-sense, good government measure which promotes U.S. exports, and correspondingly keeps companies from moving good jobs in distribution and logistics offshore.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today briefly to discuss the publication of the latest list of dormant accounts in Swiss banks. 
On October 29, 1997, the Swiss Bankers Association published its second list of dormant accounts. The list contains some 3,700 names of account holders that have not been heard from since May 9, 1945, the conclusion of the Second World War. This is the second time the Swiss Bankers Association has published such a list, the first time being on July 23, 1997. On that occasion, a great number of names appeared on that list that had proven to be either Nazis or those that were unable to obtain their accounts despite repeated attempts to do so. 
The latest list, contains the names of Johann Rohani and Anna Rohanny, of Amsterdam. Yesterday afternoon, I heard from the Rohany's daughter, Susan Unger, who informed my staff that these people were her parents. She went on to say that her mother had tried and been turned down in 1968 trying to claim the funds which were hers. Moreover, as late as October 1, of this year, she tried to claim the account and was turned down. Yet, when one looks at the latest list, it is inescapable that these are the same names. Apparently, the accounting firm looking for the accounts failed to check her parents' names on the then-pending lists. This is terribly unfortunate. Mrs. Unger has tried and tried to obtain funds that were legitimately hers and yet, she and her mother have been denied. 
What is even more bothersome is the fact that while the accounting firm turned her down 1 month ago, and that her parents' names appear on the new list, how many others I wonder, are in the same situation. How many have been turned down, with looking for names appearing on the first list, when they might well have appeared on this new list? We would have a better idea if the second list had been published in full like the first list. This one was not, it was only available on the Internet, through a search mechanism, not a full printout of the names, making it immensely more difficult, if not impossible to find names, if you do not see all of them. 
Mr. President, the Swiss banks have a long way to go before they can regain the respectability they once had. Continued indifference to cases such as this are very unfortunate. I wish for the sake of the claimants they would come to their senses and do what is right. One can only hope.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, to introduce legislation that will declare the Lower East Side Tenement Museum a national historic site. Most of us have heard the stories of how the great wave of immigrants of generations ago entered our Nation, but few really know what happened to them after they landed at Ellis Island. At the Lower East Side Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in New York City, one is able to follow the lives of the immigrants beyond the first hours on our shores. The museum tells their history, displays their courage and showcases their values in an interpretive setting that brings the visitor back to an era from which many of us came. The museum presents to many of us an awareness of our ancestral roots that we may never have known existed. Through the legislation being introduced by Senator Moynihan and me, the museum will be able to affiliate itself with the National Park Service, bestowing national recognition on the humble beginnings of millions of our ancestors. 
The Tenement Museum is unique in that it not only traces the quality of life inside the tenement, but presents a picture of the immigrant's outside world as well. Due to the cramped and dingy nature of the tenement, as much time as possible was spent outside. Thus, in order to fully explore their lives, it is essential to look toward their work, their houses of worship, their organizations, and their entertainment. The museum incorporates the experiences of yesteryear's immigrants and interprets them for today's generations. It gives the visitor a powerful glimpse into the life and living arrangements that our ancestors faced on a daily basis. Besides onsite programs, the museum utilizes the surrounding neighborhood; an area which continues to this day in its role as a receiver of immigrants. 
Throughout our Nation we have preserved, remembered and cherished places of national significance and beauty. We have put enormous energy toward maintaining homes of noted Americans and protecting vast areas of wilderness. What we do not have, though, is a monument to the so-called ordinary citizen. The Tenement Museum can fill that role and will do so at no cost to the Federal Government under this legislation. 
It is unlikely that many of those who lived in buildings like the one at 97 Orchard Street felt that they were special. Rather, they were probably grateful for the chance to come to America to try to make a better life for themselves and their families. Given the living and working conditions that we now take for granted, the language and cultural obstacles they had to overcome, we should applaud their ability to take hold of an opportunity and not only survive, but thrive. It is their contributions to society in the face of overwhelming obstacles that defined an era and established an ethic that survives to this day. It is their spirit that we admire, and that, in retrospect, makes these otherwise ordinary individuals special. The Tenement Museum is their monument, and as their descendants, it is ours as well. 
Congress has an opportunity to recognize the pioneer spirit of our ancestors and deliver it to future generations of Americans. The museum reminds us all of an important and often forgotten chapter in our immigrant heritage, mainly, that millions of families made their first stand in our Nation not in a log cabin or farmhouse or mansion, but in a city tenement. Granting the Lower East Side Tenement Museum affiliated status within the National Park Service will shed light on that chapter while linking it to the chain of the Status of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Castle Clinton in the story of our urban immigrant heritage. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Moynihan and me in cosponsoring this bill, and I urge its speedy consideration by the Senate.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Holocaust Victims Redress Act. 
We all know that the Second World War was one of the darkest periods in the history of mankind. Nazi Germany used its vast resources, technology, and extensive transportation system for the sole purpose of the persecution and annihilation of a single people, simply because of their religion. This inhumanity was unheard of in history. 
Starvation, disease, slavery, random executions, children separated from their parents, husbands separated from their wives, the murder of infants, the rate of women; these were the everyday tortures inflicted on the Jews of Europe by their Nazi aggressors. By the end of the war, the bulk of the Jewish population, 6 million men, women and children had been killed. And those displaced and demoralized few who survived this ordeal were left to pick up the pieces of their lives and start anew. 
Today, we all know what the Swiss bankers did with the Jewish assets entrusted to them. Yet, during that period, the United States Government seized $198 million in German assets and froze an estimated $1.2 billion more in Swiss assets located in the United States, later returned to Switzerland in 1946, after the signing of the Washington accords. The unfortunate fact is that among the capital confiscated by our Government were funds belonging to Holocaust victims, frozen to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Third Reich. 
Realizing that there were victims of the Holocaust who may not have had any legal heirs, Congress, after the war, authorized the transfer of $3 million from those assets to organizations providing relief and rehabilitation to Holocaust survivors. However, only one-sixth of that amount was ever paid to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, dedicated to the task of caring for the survivors. In June of this year, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, in testimony before the House Banking Committee, urged Congress to reconsider the $500,000 settlement made with survivors of the Holocaust, who had assets in U.S. banks, saying they have a compelling moral claim to the unpaid portion of the estimated $3 million that was originally authorized for compensation. 
The Holocaust Victims Redress Act seeks to right these wrongs, providing some amount of justice to survivors of the Holocaust while they are still alive, doing so in the following ways: 
As I stated earlier, only one-sixth of the amount authorized by Congress was actually paid to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization of New York. This bill would authorize the appropriation of funds equal to the present value of the unpaid difference. 
It would seek to strike an agreement among the signatories of the Paris Agreement on Reparations whereby all, or a substantial portion, of the gold held by the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold would be contributed to charitable organizations to assist elderly survivors of the Holocaust. 
Furthermore, it expresses the sense of Congress that all governments should act in good faith and facilitate efforts to return private and public properties, looted by the Nazis, to their rightful owners in accordance with the Hague Convention of 1907. 
I would like to congratulate my colleagues, Representatives Jim Leach of Iowa and Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairmen of the House Banking and House International Affairs Committees respectively, for their work to introduce this bill in the House. It is a good bill. It is the right and just thing to do. It offers at least a modicum of justice to a rapidly diminishing population which has long suffered the wounds of hatred and bigotry inflicted by the Nazis. This legislation has the support of the administration, as demonstrated by Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat. I strongly urge the bill's speedy adoption.

Mr. DAMATO. I want to congratulate the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Senator Abraham, for focusing on this issue and am pleased to join him and my other colleagues in putting forth this legislation which is aimed at correcting deficiencies that exist in the current law. 
Let me say I don't intend to repeat all of the arguments put forth by my colleagues. But I do want to point out, very clearly, there are a number of my colleagues who are concerned about the impact of implementation of this legislation. 
We were given such assurances as it related to its enforcement--that there was no intent to impose various requirements that would actually stop people from Canada who were coming in on a daily basis--millions of people, millions. In New York, 2.7 million Canadians visit for at least 1 night. One bridge, the Peace Bridge, carries 80 million dollars' worth of goods and services between Canada and New York, my State. Mr. President, 80 million dollars' worth of merchandise a day. 
It is estimated that if we impose this law that we will impose more time on inspections, which is now about 30 seconds per person, and make that at least 2 minutes a person. We will have traffic jams of 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours. We will cost American consumers hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. We will disrupt trade. We will create an absolute catastrophe at our borders. 
Now, is that what we intend to do? If we really want to go after drug dealers, and that is what this intends to do, then let's go after them. We know who the cartel leaders are. 
You are going to stop millions of people on a daily basis who are traveling back and forth between Canada and the United States? That is not going to affect the drug trade. Who are we kidding? 
The implementation of this would be costly because we are talking about $1 billion a day in trade. That is what we are talking about, $1 billion a day. 
Senator Simpson, who was chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration last year, along with Congressman Lamar Smith, chairman of the House committee, in a letter that they wrote to the Canadian Ambassador, said that `We did not intend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards * * * on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.' 
Mr. President, this legislation authored by Senator Abraham, and which I am very pleased to support, would exclude Canadians who are currently exempted, just like we told the Canadian Ambassador. So this legislation really keeps a commitment that was made to our friends, to our partners in Canada, and one in which I must say is absolutely vital to the interests of many, many communities. 
Let me mention a number of communities who have said if this legislation is not amended, it would be disastrous: Buffalo, NY; Syracuse, NY; Onondaga County; Oswego County and Plattsburgh. I have to tell you, they have been absolutely aghast. These are just some of the communities who have written to me and expressed, by either way of their elected officials or by the various trade groups and representatives, that this would be catastrophic. I believe they are right. 
This bill will stop problems before they are created--traffic jams never envisioned before, the flow of goods and services absolutely brought to a stop. I don't think we should wait for the problem to take place, nor do I think we can continue to abdicate our responsibility. As Senator Abraham has pointed out quite eloquently, we have not gotten the kind of clarification necessary that would allow the normal intercourse of business between our two great countries. You can't jeopardize people's lives, the well-being of our communities and, indeed, our national prosperity. I am pleased to support this bill. I hope we can get Senator Abraham speedy action on this. I intend to support Senator Abraham in every way possible and I want to commend you for having brought this to the attention of the U.S. Congress and putting forth legislation in such a thoughtful way. 
Last but not least, this legislation does something that is pretty important. It calls for increasing the number of Customs and INS inspectors and says at least half of them have to be placed on northern borders. While I understand that we have some tremendous problems on our southern borders dealing with the flow of drugs, we cannot underestimate the importance of continuing the process of commerce--in a manner which will continue to expand upon it and not impinge upon it. 
I thank my colleague from Michigan for being so forthright on this. I hope we can get this legislation passed sooner rather than later. 
To reiterate, 
I am pleased to join with the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Senator Abraham and the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Kennedy, to introduce the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997--a bill that will preserve the smooth and efficient trade and travel experienced between the United States and Canada. 
A provision of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act has caused enormous trepidation among businesses and families living along the northern border of the United States and Canada. Several organizations have contacted me with their concern about section 110 of the 1996 act--a provision that requires `every alien' to display documents upon entry to or exit from the United States. 
To put this problem into perspective, let me explain what implementation of section 110 would mean for New York State. Over 2.7 million Canadians visit New York each year for at least 1 night, spending over $400 million. Last year, my State's exports to Canada exceeded $9.5 billion and the first 6 months of 1997 has seen a rise in exports. The ties between the communities are strong and must not be disrupted. 
The common council of the city of Plattsburgh has submitted a resolution indicating the threat to the strong relationship enjoyed by Canada and the United States--its economic, cultural, and social impact. The Greater Buffalo Partnership states that there are about 5,000 trucks moving goods through the port of Buffalo every day that will be subject to a time intensive document production under this provision. They conclude that `this provision will cause 5-hour delays and jeopardize every business relying on just in time deliveries.' 
This new requirement will cause unprecedented traffic jams at the border and chaos in the business and travel industry in northern New York. 
Implementation of this border restriction would be costly for both American and Canadian business and tourism throughout both nations. Nationally, trade with Canada hovers near $1 billion a day and there has been up to 116 million people entered the United States from Canada in 1996. As bilateral trade grows every year, traffic congestion and back ups could be expected to last hours, translating into frustration and lost opportunities. 
When Congress passed this law, there was no intent to impose this requirement on Canadians. As expressed by Senator Alan Simpson, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration last year, and Congressman Lamar Smith, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Immigration, in a letter to the Canadian Ambassador, `we did not intend to impose a new requirement for border crossing cards * * * on Canadians who are not presently required to possess such documents.' 
This new legislation will exclude Canadians, who are currently exempted from documentary requirements, from having to register every arrival and departure at the United States border. Because of the tremendous burden of enforcement on our borders, the bill also authorizes an increase of at least 300 INS inspectors and 150 Customs inspectors each year. 
There is a major problem brewing on our border with Canada. It's a problem that threatens vital trade and travel between our two countries. This bill will halt the problem, and allow our normal trade and tourism to continue successfully. I am proud to lead the effort to pass this important legislation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the A plus Education Savings Accounts Act which will provide families--an estimated 14.3 million families by 2002--with the opportunity to save for their children's education, an investment by parents for their children's future. 
Education savings accounts allow parents, grandparents and scholarship sponsors to contribute up to $2,500 a year per child for an account that will be used for a child's education. The interest accrued will be tax-free as long as the funds are used to further the best possible education for their children. 
The funds saved by parents must be used for educational purposes--and can include expenses for home computers, tutoring for children with special needs or tuition for a private school. The money will be used in the most efficient manner because it will be the parents who make the decision on how to use the money. 
These education savings accounts leave public resources in public schools and let parents use their own money to augment education for their most precious investment--their children. 
This is a common sense approach--an education reform that gives control back to parents, improving education for their children. 
We must encourage parental involvement in their child's education, and this is an excellent way to allow that involvement, making the education system more responsive to parents.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution on the human rights situation in Turkey. This resolution is prompted by that country's desire to host the next summit meeting of the heads of state or government of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. This summit meeting is scheduled to take place in 1998. The issue is which country will host this most important OSCE gathering. 
Last November, the Republic of Turkey--an original OSCE participating state--first proposed Istanbul as the site for the next OSCE summit. At that time, I wrote to then-Secretary of State Christopher, together with Commission Co-Chairman Christopher Smith, urging that the United States reject this proposal based on Turkey's dismal human rights record. I also wrote to Secretary Albright in July to reiterate my concerns regarding the state of human rights in Turkey and Ankara's failure to improve its implementation of OSCE commitments. 
Ankara has squandered the past year, failing to meaningfully address a series of longstanding human rights concerns. Regrettably, there has been no meaningful improvement in Turkey's implementation of its OSCE human rights commitments in the 11 months since our original letter to the State Department. Despite a number of changes in Turkish law, the fact of the matter is that even these modest proposals have not translated into improved human rights in Turkey. 
Mr. President, my resolution does not call for outright rejection of the Turkish proposal. Rather, the resolution calls for the United States to refuse consensus to such a plan until the Government of Turkey had demonstrably improved implementation of its freely undertaken OSCE commitments, including action to address those human rights concerns I will describe in more detail later in my remarks. Under OSCE rules, decisions require that all participating states, including the United States, give their consensus before a proposal can be adopted. The resolution we introduce today calls upon the President to report to the Congress by April 15, 1998, on any improvement to Turkey's actual human rights performance. 
Expert witnesses at a Commission briefing earlier this year underscored the continued, well-documented, and widespread use of torture by Turkish security forces and the failure of the Government of Turkey to take determined action to correct such gross violations of OSCE provisions and international humanitarian law. Even the much heralded reduction of periods for the detention of those accused of certain crimes has failed to deter the use of torture. The fact is that this change on paper is commonly circumvented by the authorities. As one United States official in Turkey observed in discussion with Commission staff, a person will be held in incommunicado 
for days, then the prisoner's name will be postdated for purposes of official police logs giving the appearance that the person had been held within the period provided for under the revised law. Turkish authorities also continue to persecute those who attempt to assist the victims of torture, as in the case of Dr. Tufan KoAE4se. 
Despite revisions in the Anti-Terror Law, its provisions continue to be broadly used against writers, journalists, publishers, politicians, musicians, and students. Increasingly, prosecutors have applied article 312 of the Criminal Code, which forbids `incitement to racial or ethnic enmity.' Government agents continue to harass human rights monitors. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 47 Turkish journalists are in jail in Turkey today--more than in any other country in the world. 
Many human rights abuses have been committed against Kurds who assert their Kurdish identity. The Kurdish Cultural and Research Foundation offices in Istanbul were closed by police in June to prevent the teaching of Kurdish language classes. In addition, four former parliamentarians from the now banned Kurdish-based Democracy Party [DEP]: Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan DogAE0an, and Selim Sadak, who have completed three years of their 15-year sentences, remain imprisoned at Ankara's Ulucanlar Prison. Among the actions cited in Leyla Zana's indictment was her 1993 appearance before the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe here in Washington, DC. The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights has expressed concern over the case of human rights lawyer Hasan DogAE0an, a member of the People's Democracy Party [HADEP], who, like many members of the party, has been subject to detention and prosecution. 
The Government of Turkey has similarly pursued an aggressive campaign of harassment of nongovernmental organizations, including the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey and the Human Rights Association. An Association forum on capital punishment was banned in early May as was a peace conference sponsored by international and Turkish NGO's. Human Rights Association branch offices in Diyarbakir, Malatya, Izmir, Konya, and Urfa have been raided and closed. 
Mr. President, last week the Congress honored His All Holiness Bartholomew, the leader of Orthodox believers worldwide. The Ecumenical Patriarchate, located in Istanbul--the city proposed by Turkey as the venue for the next OSCE summit--has experienced many difficulties. The Patriarchate has repeatedly requested permission to reopen the Orthodox seminary on the island of Halki closed by the Turkish authorities since the 1970's despite Turkey's OSCE commitment to `allow the training of religious personnel in appropriate institutions.' 
As the State Department's own Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 concluded, Turkey `was unable to sustain improvements made in 1995 and, as a result, its record 
was uneven in 1996 and deteriorated in some respects.' While Turkish civilian authorities remain publicly committed to the establishment of rule of law state and respect for human rights, torture, excessive use of force, and other serious human rights abuses by the security forces continue. As our resolution points out, the United States should encourage the development of genuine democracy in the Republic of Turkey based on protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
Mr. President, it is most unfortunate that Turkey's leaders, including President Demirel--who originally signed the 1975 Helsinki Final Act on behalf of Turkey--have not been able to effectively address these and other longstanding human rights concerns. 
The privilege and prestige of hosting such an OSCE event should be reserved for participating states that have demonstrated their support for Helsinki principles and standards--particularly respect for human rights--in both word and in deed. Turkey should not be allowed to serve as host of such a meeting until and unless that country's dismal human rights record has improved. 
While some may argue that allowing Turkey to host an OSCE summit meeting might provided political impetus for positive change, we are not convinced, particularly in light of the failure of the Turkish Government to meaningfully improve the human rights situation in the months since it offered to host the next OSCE summit. We note that several high-level conferences have been held in Turkey without any appreciable impact on that country's human rights policies or practices. 
Mr. President, promises of improved human rights alone should not suffice. Turkey's desire to host an OSCE summit must be matched by concrete steps to improve its dismal human rights record.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to speak again on an issue of, I think, paramount importance, and that is the education of our children. Mr. President, unless we bring about fundamental reform in education, we are just going to continue to nibble at the margins. We are going to have great intellectual discussions and not be able to help our children. 
The needs in our schools are great. We need better textbooks. We need to update computer facilities. We need to insist on teachers teaching the basics. And we need merit pay for good teachers. 
Our children deserve an oasis of calm in order to learn. We have to be able to get violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classroom, and `fast track' them out of the classroom. We hear about fast track for trade; what about fast tracking violent, disruptive students out of the classroom? 
Most importantly, we need to listen to parents in the local communities. This afternoon, I am going to touch on a few examples, horrendous examples, that all too often are being repeated in the educational systems throughout this country. Time after time, we see the education system supporting administrators, school principals and teachers at the expense of our children. We have to encourage parental involvement in education. When parents speak out, they have a right to be heard. They have a right to be listened to. 
One of the things that parents are clearly calling for is an end of a system of lifetime tenure, lifetime job protection regardless of whether the teacher or the school principals are doing the job. Eliminating tenure and reforming it is a desperately needed measure. The tenure system guarantees a lifetime job to teachers and school principals, regardless of their performance. 
Let me give you examples of how children suffer. These are real cases, these are our children. In junior high school 275 in Brooklyn, reading school scores have plummeted 21.5 points in the past 5 years. Sadly, this is a school that is failing our children, and they are getting hurt. 
So parents in the community, recognizing that problem, came together. The parents and the local school board wanted to deny tenure to the junior high school 275 principal, Priscilla Williams. I think we ought to applaud those parents for coming together and becoming involved and speaking out, as well as the local school board. 
Instead of listening to the parents, instead of listening to the school board, the local superintendent granted permanent tenure to principal Williams. While those scores were plummeting, the school's principal was rewarded with a lifetime guarantee, a lifetime job. So instead of correcting the situation and bringing in a principal who would turn that around, we now have children being held captive. That means these children will continue to suffer, and the school's leaders cannot be held accountable. The scene is repeated throughout the system, unfortunately. 
Let's take a look at another district, Brooklyn's district 23. The school board pleaded--pleaded, and these are the elected representatives--to block tenure for five principals at failing elementary and junior high schools. What is their motivation? Their motivation is to give their kids a better educational opportunity. Mr. President, sadly, all five were granted tenure anyway. So what does that mean? That means thousands of children are going to be trapped in a system that is failing them. 
Parents know that the tenure system rewards failures. Why don't we listen to these parents who are crying out for reform, who are crying out to give their children a better education? They know that the business-as-usual tenure system is hurting their children. Instead of granting tenure to Principal Williams at 
junior high school 275 where the reading scores are dropping like a rock, she should have been fired, replaced, and they should have brought in somebody who had the educational experience and the ability to raise those scores. 
As tragic as the failing levels are at junior high school 275, there is something more devastating that took place more recently at another school. Again, these are real children involved. This was a school in the Bronx, PS 44, where two 9-year-old girls were brutally sexually assaulted by four boys----9-year-old children at school. The girls reported this incredibly horrendous assault to their teacher. The teacher, in turn, reported it to the school principal, Anthony Padilla. Now, what did Mr. Padilla do? Did he call the police when a teacher reports an assault on two 9-year-old children? No. Did he take any steps to assist the victim, to contact the parents? No. But he did send a letter. He sent a letter to the parents which stated, `No inappropriate behavior took place.' Imagine that--doesn't call the authorities but sends a letter to the parents saying, `No inappropriate behavior took place.' 
Well, the police did investigate the case. Juveniles have been arrested and charged with this horrendous act. But what was done with or to the principal as a result of his failure to confront and deal with this situation in an orderly manner, a brutal attack against two 9-year-old girls? I'll tell you what happened--he was reassigned to a different administrative position within the district. 
Now, let me point out something else. Padilla didn't even have tenure. He has previously been denied tenure. Why is he being protected? Why is he being kept in such a position of such responsibility where the lives of hundreds of youngsters are under his control? You have a system that protected him when he should have been fired. It is another example of a system supporting administrators and principals instead of parents and children. 
Now, Mr. President, parents know that a principal who doesn't respond to violence within a school should be fired and not just reassigned. He should have been fired. But he is reassigned. Why? Because we have a system that is more interested in protecting the rights and the perks and the privileges and has become a hiring hall. It is an employment center, as opposed to being a center of learning, of knowledge. Something is seriously wrong when they are more concerned with the perks and privileges of the union members, regardless of how they are performing. 
Mr. President, let's set the record straight. I believe the vast number of our teachers are good, are dedicated, are great professionals. We should reward them and we should pay them for that and we should recognize that. But the incompetent who are receiving lifetime job security are eroding this system both at the administrative level and, yes, in the classrooms. Something is seriously wrong when parents try to get involved in their children's education--in the examples I pointed out to you, where the school boards are begging for changes--and the system refuses to respond to them. 
That is exactly what has happened when school principals are granted lifetime tenure over the objections of parents and in spite of the record of the failing schools. The tenure system has kept some principals in schools for 25 years while the academic performance has continually declined. That is wrong and has to be stopped. 
I want to congratulate the parents for getting involved in their children's education. Nothing is more important. We have an obligation to reform our educational system. We have to get rid of today's system that ignores parents and rewards failing principals with lifetime tenure and replace it with a new system, a system that listens to parents and rewards their involvement and thinks about the education of the children first, not the perks and privileges of those who work in the system. 
I yield the floor, and I thank my colleagues for granting me this additional time.

Mr. DAMATO. I thank the Senator. I first would like to commend my friend and colleague from Alabama for the fine leadership he has shown in crafting the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations bill. He has done a wonderful job in allocating scarce federal resources equitably for New York and the entire nation for highway, transit, rail and other infrastructure needs. 
I ask my colleague if he is familiar with an intermodal transportation simulation and technology project on Long Island called the Center for Advanced Simulation and Technology (CAST)?

Mr. DAMATO. As my friend knows, no specific appropriation was provided in the fiscal year 1998 conference agreement to allow CAST to go forward in this fiscal year. Therefore, I would like to work with the Chairman, the Long Island Congressional delegation and the Department of Transportation in an effort to find a source of funding to continue work on CAST in this fiscal year.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, last night, the Hong Kong stock market lost 10 percent of its value. In the past week it has dropped 25 percent of its value. Panic stock selling has taken over the Hong Kong market. All stock markets around the world are declining very heavily. And as of 2:30 this afternoon the Dow Jones industrial average was down 215 points. 
This is no coincidence. This is not just the normal fluctuation of the stock market. This is a warning sign of what could be yet to come in Hong Kong now that the Communist Chinese have taken over. 
I have spoken out before on this floor about the dangers of the Communist takeover in Hong Kong and, regrettably, my fears appear to be coming true. There is a simple but profound lesson here for Americans and for all freedom-loving people around the world. Until recently, Hong Kong was an oasis of economic vibrance and freedom surrounded by the Communist dictatorship on the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong was economically strong because Hong Kong was free. 
Freedom knows no boundaries. Whether it is in America or Europe or Africa or Latin America or Asia, freedom is what creates the opportunity for people and ideas to prosper, but wherever the Communists have ruled freedom dies. 
Mr. President, the collapse of communism in Russia and Eastern Europe is one of the epic stories of our time, a true triumph of the human spirit against the forces of oppression. Unfortunately, the brave people of Hong Kong are suffering a reversal. It is tragic to see a free people come under the yoke of Communist rule. 
There is still freedom of Hong Kong today, but the warning signs are ominous. We Americans, as the world's foremost champions of freedom, must remain vigilant in our efforts to prevent the Chinese Communists from imposing the full force of their dictatorship on the people of Hong Kong. I pledge to do that, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in this noble effort to be vigilant and not to permit the compromise of freedom on the altar of greed and profits. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, on September 30, Total, a French company, and Petronas, a Malaysian company, and Gazprom, a Russian company, signed a $2 billion agreement to develop the South Pars oilfields in Iran. This contravenes the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act which passed the Senate unanimously, and passed the House of Representatives with I think all but four votes, and which was signed into law August 5, 1996, by President Clinton. 
Mr. President, the history of the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act is one that, unfortunately, it seems to me, too many are ready to forget. Too many are ready to forget the 300-plus American citizens who were killed in PanAm 103, or that two Libyan agents have been indicted in connection with that terrorist attack and provided a safe harbor by the Libyan Government. Too many of us are fickle, it seems to me, and are ready to forget past acts of terrorism committed by these two countries because of political expedience, on the altar of corporate profits and greed. 
Let us bring their arguments right out here: `Oh, if we don't participate in this, others will. If we don't provide the bullets for the killers, others will, so why don't we sell them. Oh, forget the fact that this legislation was passed unanimously because, when this bill passed it was in close proximity to another tragedy that took place, the TWA flight that inexplicably exploded off the shores of Long Island.' When the legislation passed, people were concerned whether or not it might have been a terrorist bomb or missile. I am not suggesting that it was terrorism, but there was that concern, and so the Congress was quick to respond. 
I think we responded correctly. We said to those who are going to do business with countries that export terrorism, that are in the business of financing the fanatical kinds of acts that result in a terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York where 6 people are killed, that result in the bombing of the barracks in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia where our troops are killed, that engage in the kind of terrorist attack sponsored by the Libyans where 300-plus Americans are killed; we are not going to help promote trade with those countries that played a role in these attacks. And if companies and countries want to enter into agreements that will promote the financial resources and development of Iran and Libya, then they cannot have free access to the marketplace in America. 
Is that a sacrifice? Yes, it is. Is it a sacrifice that we have a right to expect? I believe it is. Should it be greeted by the French Prime Minister standing up and cheering on the day that Total enters into this agreement, an agreement that our State Department was aware of and attempted to intercede and to get the French to work with us? I don't believe so. 
What does that sanction bill provide? It has a litany of opportunities for the Libyans and the Iranians to escape punitive measures; if they act in conformity with the world community and stop sponsoring terrorist attacks, if they begin to show actions that they will live and let live, then the President does have the ability to relax and alter those sanctions. 
But, Mr. President, to date there has not been one showing, not one, that any of those countries, the Libyans or the Iranians, are willing to cease and desist from promoting terrorist attacks against the United States, against our interests and against those who seek peace and want to live in peace. Indeed, if anything, they have become more violent. 
By the way, I say to those who argue that this agreement or this arrangement or this law has not worked, it has worked. We know that there have been billions of dollars of investments that would have gone into promoting the economy of Iran so that they would have more resources to export terrorism that has been precluded. 
For the leader of France to stand up and cheer, I believe, is horrendous. For him to say that this is extraterritorial legislation flies in the face of common sense. Are you really saying that the United States cannot take a position; `that we are not going to support terrorist nations, that there will be sanctions, and that you cannot do business with us as if everything is fine and well and that you are comporting yourself as a good world citizen?' 
Let me suggest to you that many of those who decry the U.S. position were the same who were so quick to come in and say a recent corporate merger that was about to take place should not take place. Oh, yes, the European Community, led by, once again, our friends the French, were ready to step in and say that the agreement between two American companies, McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, be invalidated. What about extraterritoriality in that situation? And in that case we are talking about two companies that are not exporting terrorism right here within the United States. Yet today we have the European Common Market talking about sanctioning the United States if we were to proceed in allowing those two aircraft manufacturers to merge and not ask for waivers and not work out a situation, because this would be competition that would be difficult for a European company, Airbus. 
So let us not have a situation where there are those who are willing to condemn us for fighting terrorism--and by the way, how do we take on those who promote terrorism? We cannot bomb them. I am not suggesting that we do. But should we not deny them the financial resources with which to fuel the engine for exporting terrorism? Of course, we should. 
It takes a little courage. I think that our administration has not done the kind of things that it should do behind the scenes, working with our allies to make this policy one that is easier to enforce. We have not told the Europeans to stand up to the Iranians, and say `if you want to be able to have commerce and trade like others, then you have to behave. There is a code of conduct that we expect of you, or otherwise, there will be sanctions.' We have simply not told them to tell the Iranians that. 
There was once a time not too long ago when we imposed sanctions of all kinds on our current allies, the Russians, before the wall of communism came down. Sanctions that related to human rights, related to their anti-democratic activities. We didn't have pure free trade and commerce under the sanctions of yesterday, so the sanctions of today aren't anything new. For those who say somehow this is terrible, I'll tell you what is terrible: I think it is terrible that we have not laid our cards on the table with our allies and told them we expect them to join with us in the battle against terrorism. 
I received a letter from our colleagues Senator Brownback and Senator Kyl, asking that the Banking Committee hold a hearing on the question of offering $1 billion of convertible bonds on the U.S. markets. And what were these bonds to be used for? They were to be used for helping to finance a company by the name of Gazprom; Gazprom, the very Russian company that helped bring about this deal promoting the exploration and development of the oil fields in Iran. Owing to the fact that Gazprom is clearly one of those companies that is in violation of the Iran-Libyan Sanction Act, and it can be sanctioned, I have a difficult time understanding--along with my colleagues Senator Kyl and Senator Brownback who have raised the question whether or not we should permit financing under our law--whether these financing activities wouldn't be in violation of our national security. Do these activities require a waiver from the President? We will be holding a hearing next week, next Thursday, to ascertain this. 
In addition, I have learned from a number of accounts that Gazprom is now negotiating with our Export-Import Bank to get something in the area of $800 to $850 million worth of Export-Import Bank credits. This is incredible. Today I have written a letter to Senator McConnell in which I have asked him to take the appropriate actions to see to it that this is not business as usual, that he puts a hold on this as he is marking up the appropriations bill dealing with the Export-Import Bank.

Mr. DAMATO. I urged upon Senator McConnell in the strongest terms to seek an end to this financing in the fiscal year 1998 foreign operations bill. If, indeed, we are going to have a situation where, on one hand we have a law that says you cannot do business with these countries, and on the other hand we are indirectly financing a corporation which is going to be undertaking these activities, then I think this is wrong. How can the United States provide $800 to $850 million worth of Export-Import Bank credits allowing U.S. companies to do more business with companies whose actions violate U.S. law and damage U.S. security? So we certainly have an obligation to look into this. 
In fact, Gazprom is a company that is closely tied to the Russian Prime Minister, Victor Chernomyrdin. And when the Vice President, Vice President Gore, was in Russia several weeks ago, he reportedly spoke at length, to Mr. Chernomyrdin, about the Russian company's providing missile technology to Iran. It is my understanding Mr. Chernomyrdin said he had no knowledge of this, and that he could not do anything about it. 
What are we talking about? I mean, the fact of the matter is the Russians have been providing this technology to Iran. It seems to me this situation is like the parent who doesn't want to acknowledge that a son or daughter may have some problems with substance abuse, but they look the other way. All the signs are there, but they look the other way. All the facts are there, but we don't want to have an acknowledgment. 
Let me be clear, Iran is the foremost sponsor of international terrorism. They threaten our national security, the interests of our citizens and our allies, and it is unconscionable that we provide aid to them to do so. For the Russian Prime Minister to say we should stop worrying about this threat is incredible. 
I think we should start worrying about the damage that will be done if this kind of contract is carried out by us acting as willing consorts. For Russian companies to be providing missile aid to Iran and then helping finance gas deals which will make it possible for the Iranians to undertake more terrorist activities, I think is simply impermissible. Are we supposed to really be quiet? Sit back? Are we going to really read the editorials that say that now I have somehow created a terrible situation by coming forth and saying `let's look at this, let's examine this--I believe this is wrong.' As far as Total and Petronas are concerned, I hope the administration understands the only correct course to take is to implement the law and to impose the sanctions to their fullest and to sit down with our allies and say to them: Instead of poking us in the eye deliberately and publicly, we should be working together; not for one to advantage oneself and make a quick buck. 
We cannot fail to take this initiative and implement the law the way it was intended--it was intended to bring sanctions upon those who deal with countries that promote terrorist activities unless and until those countries change and mend their ways. Failure to act now will only come back to haunt us in the future. It will only bring more in the way of conduct that can be detrimental to world peace and to our security and to the national interests of the United States. I hope we have the courage to stand and act, instead of listening to those in the corporate and business sector come down and say: `Oh, well, if they take this action today against Total that tomorrow it may impact against us.' 
This is a battle. It is a war. It is a different kind but in many ways it is even more dangerous, more pernicious, more evil than the kinds of wars where nations may declare themselves against another nation. There, you know where the battlefields lie and you understand what is taking place. But this is a savage one, which is waged against innocent civilians, children--people throughout the world. That is why we need to employ all of the economic power and legal and moral authority that we have in bringing our allies together with us. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to speak to an issue which confronts us nationally and which we, as a nation, seem to be ducking. I am talking about terrorism. I am talking about the need for this country to stand up and be counted in its fight against international terrorism whenever and wherever it occurs. 
Today, Americans are threatened by two very distinct but serious kinds of terrorism. The first is international terrorism. 
Mr. President, I am proud of my efforts that helped to pass the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, a law designed to stop two renegade nations from having the means necessary to finance international terrorism--by punishing those companies who do business with them. The French oil company, Total, is trying to test our resolve. Total has struck a lucrative oil deal with Iran. This company is thumbing its nose at the United States. I believe it is incumbent upon us to remain strong in the face of these efforts to undermine our fight against terrorism. I call upon the French Government to join the fight against international terrorism, not to thumb its nose at the United States, not to applaud the efforts of Total. 
I believe that our laws must be enforced and its strict sanctions must be brought to bear on Total. Every Member of this body, Mr. President, voted for the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. 
It is only when we see planes being shot down, it is only when the victims and their families come and say, What are you doing? that we stand up and take action. Every Member of this body should be outraged that Total has thumbed its nose at this ban. They did so deliberately. Its actions are an insult not only to this body but to all of the nations of the world who should be working together in a united front against terrorism. 
Fighting international terrorism requires every nation to unite together, and it requires that we remain resolute. It requires that we put corporate greed and profits on the back burner. Many of our own companies are so worried about international profits. 
But let me tell you, when terrorism strikes here, when you see what takes place, then an aroused American public gets us to do something. Only when we see the bombing at the World Trade Center--that is real; impacting people's lives--and when we see the Iranians and the Libyans give sanctuary to terrorists, only then will we maybe do something. But then some say, Not when corporate profits get in the way. Or our allies may say, Oh, no, don't do this, knowing that these are renegade governments and countries who sponsor terrorist attacks, who are responsible for over 300 U.S. citizens being killed--and the Libyans were and they now give sanctuary to two men who have been indicted. 
No. Sadly, we have to do something. I am very concerned that the administration will shirk its responsibility. 
Sadly, I also rise today to describe another kind of terrorism, Mr. President. It is one that is too often seen but little done. It is one that permeates our Nation's school systems, particularly inner-city schools. It is a terrorism in which violent juveniles prey upon good kids. And it has to stop. 
Just as we must be united and remain resolute in our fight against international terrorism, we must be united and remain resolute in the fight at home. Once again, each and every one of 
us has a responsibility to stand up and fight this terrorism to make a difference. Business as usual is no longer acceptable. There is no more fundamental right in our democracy than the right of our children to have a good education. That requires that they be safe. That requires that a school be an oasis for learning. 
Many people have asked me why I have taken such a public and outspoken position as it relates to education reforms. New Yorkers may have been shocked when they read yesterday's newspapers of gang violence in the public schools. 
I point to those headlines. `Probe Rips Principals for Turning Blind Eye to the Gangs.' The story in the New York Post turns to the issue of the gangs which have taken over schools. 
The Daily News: `Fear Stalks Hallways as Hoods Take Over.' One student says that he feels at times safer--safer--in dangerous neighborhoods at night than he does walking in the hallways. 
We are not talking about violence in streets and alleys. This violence is taking place inside our schools, which should be sanctuaries to our children. That means that the real victims are our children. Just as we must stand up to Total and other companies who give aid and comfort to international regimes, we must stand up to the terrorism that is occurring in our classrooms. We must get violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classrooms so good kids can learn. We need fundamental sweeping reforms throughout our educational system. 
In addition to getting violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classrooms, Mr. President, we need to give merit pay to the outstanding teachers, those who are dedicated, those who want to make a difference and those who do make a difference. We have to see that we have tenure reform in order to get those teachers who are not performing, who are bad teachers out of the classroom. 
We need school choice so that parents can make educational decisions instead of Government bureaucrats. 
Finally, Mr. President, we have to stand up to the teachers unions and tell them to put our children first. Unfortunately, the unions are more interested in their perks and privileges than they are in providing a good education for our children. 
Above all, we must get violent and disruptive juveniles out of schools. I want to see more power given to our school principals to remove violent juveniles from the classrooms. We cannot tolerate the kind of situation that is taking place in more and more of our schools in more and more of our cities to more and more of our children. 
Principals should have fast-track authority. You want to talk about fast-track authority for trade? Give our principals fast-track authority to expel gang members and other violent offenders. That is what we really need to be doing to help this country and to help the educational system. 
Just like in the fight against international terrorism, more pressure has to be brought to bear on terrorism in our schools. The fight against terrorism in our schools must be a united fight. The teachers unions, who opposed every commonsense reform, surely can agree with the notion that violence in schools must be stopped. Instead of pushing for more pay and less work for teachers, the teachers unions should join me and others in a united effort to combat violence in our schools. 
That is why I have been standing up to those who ask the question, `Why do you talk about this?' We have had debates about educational reform and getting more money directly to the District so they can spend it on students, not bureaucrats. We have had debates about giving parents choice so they can give their kids an opportunity to receive a quality education. But let me say something. In every one of those situations we have seen the teachers unions come down and oppose this. They are against merit pay. They are against getting bad teachers out. They want to ensure lifetime contracts. They are interested in perks and privileges. 
By gosh, for one time, join with us and see to it that we have meaningful reforms so that we can fast track violent students out of the schools, so that good and decent kids have an opportunity to have a good education, so that children can learn in safety. 
Mr. President, I do not think there is a more important fight against terrorism that we can and must and should win than that which confronts our children every day, unfortunately, in too many of the schools throughout this country. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for the inclusion of the Senate's `Mark to Market' reform legislation in the Fiscal Year 1998 VA-HUD Appropriations Conference Report. The conference report effectively incorporates The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (S. 513), as passed by the Banking Committee and full Senate with minor modification. 
This legislation averts a serious affordable housing crisis by restructuring the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [HUD] Federal Housing Administration [FHA] insured section 8 project-based assisted portfolio. This legislation will save taxpayer money by reducing above-market rents on section 8 properties, will protect residents, and will help maintain a stock of affordable housing which will remain available for the future. The financial viability of assisted projects will be protected by refinancing and restructuring mortgages which are insured by the FHA. 
I salute my friend and colleague Senator Connie Mack, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community Development, for his outstanding efforts in crafting this legislation and ensuring its swift enactment. Through his extraordinary leadership this legislation has been developed in a bipartisan, measured and thoughtful manner. I thank my friend Senator Kit Bond for the critical role he played in the development of this bill as a member of the Banking Committee in the last Congress and for his leadership as chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in bringing this measure to final passage. 
Mr. President, this legislation is supported by a broad range of interest groups including resident organizations, owners, nonprofit housing associations, the National Governors Association, the National Affordable Housing Management Association, the National Housing Conference, the National Association of Home Builders, and the National Council of State Housing Finance Agencies. The New York Housing Conference and the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition have been instrumental in the development of this bill and I thank them for their valuable input and support. 
This legislation addresses the escalating costs of the HUD section 8 program and achieves fiscal year 1998 savings of $562 million. Importantly, this legislation will save the American taxpayer $4.6 billion over the next 10 years by reducing exorbitant rents in the section 8 program. At the same time, the legislation will protect the FHA multifamily insurance fund from losses due to defaults. The mortgage restructuring provisions contained in this bill will allow projects to continue to operate effectively with reduced rent levels. 
Mr. President, millions of needy Americans depend on section 8 housing to provide them with affordable shelter. The average income of these families, elderly and disabled persons is similar to those in Federal public housing--approximately 17 percent of the local area median income. In addition, over 35 percent of these persons are elderly. Many more are disabled or families with children. It is essential that we protect these residents. 
Mr. President, the legislation protects residents from displacement and provides them with a meaningful voice in the restructuring process. Resident involvement is essential to prevent physical deterioration of buildings, identify criminal activity and threats to health and safety, and contribute to the long-term viability of the affected buildings and communities. The legislation provides for a strong role on the part of residents to participate in activities such as the determination of eligibility for restructuring, decisions to renew project-based contracts, the formation of the rental assistance assessment plan, capital needs and management assessments, and physical inspections. 
In addition, resident involvement in the decisions which affect their communities and lives will be further ensured by the selection of resident-friendly participating administrative entities [PAE]. The legislation mandates that any organization selected as a PAE must have a demonstrated track record of working directly with residents of low-income housing projects and with community-based organizations. It is imperative that these PAE's provide for resident input that is meaningful. This will be achieved by the PAE providing residents timely, adequate and effective written notice of proposed decisions, timely access to relevant information and an adequate time period for analysis and provision of comments to the PAE and HUD. The PAE and HUD will take into account resident comments in a thoughtful and constructive manner. 
Mr. President, the bill seeks to preserve affordable housing throughout our nation for the benefit of current and future residents. Criteria have been developed to assess whether a project should maintain project-based assistance or be converted, in whole or in part, to tenant-based assistance. Projects in disrepair will be rehabilitated, where feasible, and their proper maintenance will be ensured. The legislation contains important new enforcement tools for HUD to employ to crack down on fraud, waste and abuse by unscrupulous landlords. Landlords who break the rules will be banned from the program. New protections against equity skimming, as well as expanded civil money penalties will greatly assist efforts to eliminate owners who have cheated the Federal Government. In addition, the legislation refocuses HUD's efforts on oversight and enforcement. By devolving the primary responsibility for conducting mortgage restructurings to the State and local level, HUD staff will be able to concentrate on rooting out abuses within the system. 
Rents on restructured properties will be set at local market rates based on comparable properties, or where comparables are unavailable, at 90 percent of HUD's Fair Market Rent [FMR]. The legislation provides that up to 20 percent of a given PAE's inventory may receive budget-based rents, capped at 120 percent of FMR, in order to maintain the financial viability of the projects. 
The HUD Secretary may waive the 20 percent limitation upon a demonstration of special need. Report language accompanying The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (S. 947), which passed the Senate on June 25, 1997, states:  
The Committee expects that the Secretary shall utilize this important discretionary tool to address the unique circumstances of various communities and regions throughout the nation. The Secretary should consider relevant local or regional conditions to determine whether good cause exists in granting such a waiver. Such factors should include, but should not be limited to: (1) whether the jurisdiction is classified as a `high cost area' under other federal statutes or programs; (2) prevailing costs of constructing or developing housing; (3) local regulatory barriers which may have contributed to increased development costs; (4) State or local rent control or rent stabilization laws; (5) the costs of providing necessary security or services; high energy costs; the relative age of housing in a jurisdiction; or (6) other factors which may have contributed to high development or operational costs of affordable housing in a given jurisdiction.' 
By providing a priority to State and local housing finance agencies [HFA] to serve as PAE's, we recognize and build upon the increasing financial and housing management expertise of these public entities. HFA's are accountable to State and local governments and the public and are dedicated to increasing the availability of affordable housing. In addition, they have extensive experience with the section 8 portfolio itself and will be able to leverage additional resources for its benefit. 
Mr. President, this legislation protects the interests of the Federal taxpayer, the security of our residents and the future of affordable housing. It is with great pride that I commend my colleagues in the Senate for working together to avoid the social and fiscal crisis which would have occurred had HUD's multifamily inventory not been reformed. This legislation was carefully crafted with the spirit of bipartisanship for over 2 years. I salute all who contributed to this important and essential effort and support immediate passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Kit Bond, for the purposes of clarifying the intent of the VA-HUD Conferees in regard to several aspects of the section 8 reforms included in the conference report. 
First, I would like to clarify the intent of the conferees regarding determination of market rent levels. In my home State of New York, there are some 1.2 million apartments which are covered by State rent control and rent stabilization laws. It is particularly important that the participating administrative entities [PAE] which conduct mortgage restructurings in New York have the flexibility to consider the rents of these apartments, particularly those subject to rent stabilization or rent control regulation, in making determinations of market rents. 
Mr. President, I note with regret that the Fair Market Rent [FMR] System currently used by HUD has numerous flaws, especially when applied to a metropolitan area as large and diverse as New York City and its surrounding suburbs. For instance, HUD utilizes a single Fair Market Rent estimate for the entire municipality which fails to take into account the various differences in true market rents between such disparate markets as Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Rockland County. These markets are vastly different, but HUD's FMR system does not reflect these variations. 
This legislation, which originated in the Banking Committee, takes into account the shortcomings and limitations of the FMR System. Instead of relying on this flawed system, the bill adopts an approach which would allow participating administrative entities to estimate true market rents based on comparable properties. While it is true that rent levels which are subject to State and local rent regulation may not fully reflect true market rents, nevertheless they can often form the basis for estimating such true market rents. Indeed, many rent stabilized apartments in New York City are far closer to true market rent levels than HUD's FMR estimates. 
Mr. President, I thank the conferees for including legislative amendments to the original Senate bill, S. 513, in the final legislation which will allow participating administrative entities to consider rent stabilized units for the purposes of estimating local market rents. I would ask my friend, Senator Bond, if my statements are consistent with the intent of the conferees?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his clarifying remarks. I would ask for one additional point of clarification. 
Mr. President, the section 8 reform provisions include a mandatory renewal of project-based assistance for restructured properties which have a significant number of elderly or disabled persons, or which are located in tight rental markets, such as New York City. In addition, there is a local option to replace project-based assistance contracts with section 8 vouchers, after completion of a rental assistance assessment plan by the PAE with meaningful consultation with the owner of the affected project. 
This plan, as with all aspects of the overall mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plan, shall also be developed with an opportunity for meaningful input by the affected residents as well. It is imperative that residents be kept informed of the process for mortgage restructuring and the possibility of receiving tenant-based assistance, and be offered ample opportunity to voice their preferences as to the type of assistance provided. It would not be outside the authority of the PAE to conduct a survey, on a project-by-project basis, as to resident preferences in this regard. 
Mr. President, I would like to emphasize the role of State and local decisionmaking in making this determination. It is not the intent of the drafters of the legislation that HUD attempt to micromanage or second-guess the determination of the PAE. Neither is it their intent that the HUD implementing regulations include one-sided interpretations of the statutory language which will force a preference for tenant-based assistance upon the local decisionmakers. The criteria are intentionally objective and neutral and the final decision for applying them rests at the local level. 
In addition, in interpreting these criteria, the participating administrative entities should, to the fullest extent possible, consider the local experience of the various forms of housing assistance. For instance, the PAE should consider the actual effectiveness of tenant-based assistance. In many cases, voucher-holders are unable to utilize their vouchers. In many areas too, voucher-holders often find their choices constrained to certain areas, neighborhoods and projects. The lease-up rates and need to utilize section 8 reserves in order to improve these rates by the local public housing authorities would be relevant in determining the local effectiveness of the voucher program. 
Also, in determining the relative affordability of vouchers, the PAE should consider whether a resident's rental contribution could rise above 30 percent of his or her income. Recent data from HUD indicate that a large percentage of voucher-holders pay more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent, and many pay more than half of their incomes in rent. This data is extremely disturbing. The rent burden of voucher-holders is especially relevant in making these determinations. The PAE could consider the impact of reductions in the FMR to the 40th percentile of available units on tenant-choice and rent burden as well. 
Whenever possible, the PAE should use local experience in making this determination rather than relying on national averages, which often are rendered meaningless when applied locally. PAE's should asses the need for a stock of affordable housing which will be available on a long-term basis, when judged in light of the housing needs identified in the local consolidated plan. PAE's should consider the amount of multifamily housing currently being developed in that area which is affordable to low-income families. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that PAE's consider the characteristics of specific projects. For instance, a particular project could contain a number of apartments with three or more bedrooms in a geographic area where there is a dearth of such affordable housing available to large families. In all cases, PAE's should consider the long-term consequences of their decisions. I would ask my friend, Senator Kit Bond, whether my statements are fully consistent with the intent of the conferees?

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, as you may be aware, the 1997 season marks the 100th team to play football for Middletown High School. 
During these 100 years, Middletown football teams have been coached by Messrs. Bright, Massee, Sjellander, Cady, Spaulding, Greason, Southwell, Sundstrom, Downing, Springman, Goes, Sampson, Hughes, Finch, Bateman, Rodiak, Nania, Whitehead, Brunner, Wolslayer, Ryder, and Scali. 
Asylum, Hayes, Wilson, and Faller are the football fields where the Middletown High School teams have played their games during the past century. 
For the past 100 years, Middletown football teams have embraced the spirit of competition and have established a winning tradition. 
Counted among former MHS football players are elected officials, teachers, doctors, coaches, construction workers, lawyers, businessmen, and members of the military who continue to make positive contributions to their community. 
For the past 100 years, the `Middies' have been supported by the board of education, government, civic and fraternal organizations, and the greater Middletown community. 
For these reasons, we ask that you give pause.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux, to introduce long overdue legislation to increase the private activity tax-exempt bond cap to $75 per capita or $250 million, if greater, and index the cap to inflation. The current cap, which has not been adjusted in over a decade--not even to account for inflation--is severely restricting the ability of States and localities to meet pressing housing, economic development, and other needed investments in their citizens and communities. 
This cap, imposed in 1986, is now $50 per capita or $150 million, if greater. It applies to issuers of tax-exempt bonds for affordable single and multifamily housing, redevelopment of blighted areas, student loans, manufacturing, municipal service, and hazardous waste disposal facilities. 
Cap growth is limited to State population increases, but not inflation. As a result, inflation has severely eroded capped bonds' purchasing power. The 1987 bond cap, adjusted for the current limit, would have been $14.3 billion. Ten years later, the 1997 cap is $15 billion a mere 5-percent increase--due to population--over a period of far greater inflation. 
Mr. President, Congress never intended to restrict the growth of this program. In fact, Congress never intended the cap to shrink at all. It allowed the cap to grow with State populations and imposed the cap in the same legislation, the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which terminated by 1989 the two heaviest cap users: mortgage revenue bonds [MRB's] for housing, and industrial revenue bonds [IDB's] for manufacturing. That left plenty of room for the remaining capped bonds. Congress then extended MRB's and IDB's several times past the 1989 expiration dates and finally made them permanent in 1993. 
What Congress did not do at that time was adjust the cap to accommodate these additional uses. Accordingly, demand for capped bonds now exceeds supply in most States. One example is the overwhelming demand in many States for MRB's, issued primarily by State Housing Finance Agencies [HFA's] to finance modestly-priced first-time homes for lower income families. In 1996, State HFA's issued almost $8 billion in MRB's for nearly 100,000 mortgages, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies [HCSHA]. 
Since January 1, 1995, the State of New York Mortgage Agency [SONYMA] has financed more than 1 billion dollars' worth of affordable first-time home mortgage loans with MRB's. SONYMA's Construction Incentive Program has allocated $250 million in MRB funding which will create 2,400 new homes and 6,000 full-time jobs in New York. 
The State of New York also relies heavily on tax-exempt bond authority for multifamily housing. In 1997 alone, the New York State Housing Finance Agency expects to finance $420 million worth of multifamily mortgage loans with multifamily housing bonds. This 
investment will create, 2,150 new, privately owned and managed apartments, 430 of which will be affordable to low-income families. In addition to providing desperately needed housing, this investment will promote economic integration in many neighborhoods. 
Unfortunately, home ownership and a decent apartment remain out of reach for thousands more families whom the MRB and multifamily housing bond programs could serve better than any other. State HFA's could have used an estimated additional $2.4 billion in bond cap authority in 1996, according to NCSHA. SONYMA could have used another $100 million last year. 
The private activity volume cap also includes tax-exempt bond authority to assist small and midsized companies finance the expansion of manufacturing facilities. These companies often do not have reasonable access to the capital markets and cannot easily finance construction of manufacturing facilities. I used these bonds in my capacity as town supervisor of Hempstead to allow existing businesses to grow and to attract new business. Without this financing, these companies, and their employees, would not be in New York State. Nationwide, over $2.612 billion of tax-exempt manufacturing bonds were issued in 1996. In 1996 alone, New York State issues over $96 million of tax-exempt bonds for manufacturing facilities. The Council of Development Finance Agencies reported that bond issuance increased 32 percent in 1996 from the prior year. In New York, demand for this low-cost financing greatly exceeded the almost $100 million of bonds issued. The Empire State Development Corp., a public agency, reported that demand for tax-exempt bonds to support manufacturing was about 30 percent higher than the over $96 million of bonds actually issued in 1996. 
Over the years, these bonds created literally thousands of construction and permanent jobs in my home State, and tens of thousands nationwide. It is critical to raise the bond cap to facilitate job creation by small and midsized manufacturing companies. In many cases, these companies cannot obtain reasonable financing to expand, but for tax-exempt financing. 
Mr. President, nationwide, demand for all bonds under the cap outstripped supply by almost $7 billion last year, according to NCHSA. New York alone faced unmet demand of more than $1 billion for all the investments strangled by the cap. 
The Nation's Governors have adopted a policy calling for a cap increase. The Nation's State treasurers, National Association of Counties, and Association of Local Housing Financing Agencies [ALHFA] also support raising the cap. 
One-third of the House Ways and Means Committee and nearly 100 House Members overall already have cosponsored companion legislation--H.R. 979--to increase the bond cap $75 per capita or $250 million, if greater, and index the cap to inflation. 
The current cap is severely restricting the ability of States and localities from making much-needed investments in their citizens and communities. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Breaux and me in a bipartisan effort to increase the bond cap.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, Senator Graham of Florida, to introduce long overdue legislation to increase the cap on State authority to allocate low-income housing tax credits--housing credits--to $1.75 per capita, and to index the cap to inflation. The current cap of $1.25 per capita has not been adjusted--not even to account for inflation--since the program was created over a decade ago. This cap is strangling a State's capacity to meet pressing low-income housing needs. 
Annual cap growth is limited to the increase in State population, which has only been 5 percent nationwide over the past decade. During the same time period, inflation has eroded the housing credit's purchasing power by approximately 45 percent, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. 
Mr. President, as you may know, housing credits are the primary Federal-State tool for producing affordable rental housing across the country. Since 1987, State agencies have allocated more than $3 billion in housing credits to help finance nearly 900,000 apartments for low-income families, including 75,000 apartments in 1996. In my own State of New York, the credit is responsible for helping finance 44,000 apartments for low-income New Yorkers, including 4,450 apartments in 1996. 
Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office issued a comprehensive report giving the housing credit a clean bill of health. That report documents that the program in fact exceeds a number of important congressional objectives. For example, though the law allows housing credit apartment renters to earn up to 60 percent of the area median income, GAO documented the average tenant's income at just 37 percent, and found that more than three out of four renters have incomes under 50 percent of the area median income. GAO also found that rents in housing credit apartments are well below market rents, up to 23 percent less than the maximum permitted, and 25 percent below HUD's national fair market rent. 
The GAO report also documents that States are giving preference to apartments serving low-income tenants longer than the 15 years the law requires. In fact, two-thirds of the apartments GAO studied were set aside for low-income use for 30 years or more. 
A second major assessment of the credit has been objectively completed by Ernst & Young, reiterating many of the positive findings of the GAO report, demonstrating a tremendous need for additional affordable housing, and documenting the devastating effect of the current cap on States' ability to finance this critically needed housing. 
Despite the success of the housing credit in meeting affordable rental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep pace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, abandoned, or converted to market rate use each year. Increasing the housing credit cap, as Senator Graham and I propose, would allow States to finance approximately 25,000 more critically needed low-income apartments each year. 
Nationwide, demand for housing credits outstrips supply by more than 3 to 1. In 1996, States received applications requesting more than $1.2 billion in housing credits--far surpassing the $365 million in credit authority available to allocate that year. 
In New York, the New York Division of Housing and Community Renewal received applications requesting more than $104 million in housing credits in 1996--nearly four times the $29 million in credit authority it already had available. When I think of the immense need for affordable housing within my State, I can only characterize this decade-old limit on State credit authority as an overwhelmingly lost opportunity. 
Mr. President, in 1993, Congress made the housing credit permanent with unprecedented, overwhelmingly bipartisan cosponsorship. In addition, the Nation's Governors have adopted a policy calling for an increase in the housing credit cap.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support the passage of the National Flood Insurance Reauthorization Act of 1997 (S. 1179). This legislation, which I introduced on September 16, 1997, provides for a simple and straightforward 5-year extension of the National Flood Insurance Program [NFIP] until September 30, 2002. This legislation will place this important program on a steady and secure foundation so that it continues to provide protection to flood insurance policyholders and the Federal taxpayers. I thank my friend and colleague Senator Paul Sarbanes for cosponsoring this measure. 
The National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], enables over 3.7 million American families to insure their homes and possessions. In my home State of New York, 85,000 families participate in the NFIP. The NFIP allows these families, on Long Island and along the Great Lakes and the State's many rivers, to purchase insurance coverage to protect their homes in the event of a catastrophic flood. 
The NFIP employs a comprehensive approach to alleviating the risks posed by catastrophic floods. Floodplain communities participate in FEMA's community rating system and are offered incentives to adopt and enforce measures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood prevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses, the program provides stringent building standards designed to reduce the risk of future damage. These flood protection standards must be met before any structure which suffers substantial damage may be rebuilt. In addition, persons who receive disaster assistance and fail to subsequently purchase flood insurance are barred from receiving future assistance. 
Mr. President, the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs of Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay approximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this premium income, the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs in disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State and community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster prevention and mitigation activities. 
Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming the commitment of the Federal Government to help American families protect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks of catastrophic floods. Clearly, we must do more. Lenders and private insurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. States and local communities must improve their disaster planning, prevention, and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to increase participation in the program to improve the safety and soundness of the NFIP fund. Also, the Federal Government must do more to prevent and mitigate against the losses which will inevitably occur from future floods. 
Mr. President, I note that this bill has the full support of the administration. I wish to thank the members of the Banking Committee for their bipartisan support of this important measure and I urge our colleagues in the House to support its swift enactment.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, 5 years ago, the speaker of the Slovak Parliament, Ivan Gasparovic, described his country's new constitution as `an expression of centuries-old emancipation efforts of the Slovak people to have a sovereign state of their own.' He also spoke of its `supreme binding force.' Since then, the people who present themselves as the guardians of Slovakia's statehood have undermined Slovakia's constitution. 
This is what they have done. 
This May, the Ministry of Interior ignored the Constitutional Court's ruling and altered an important referendum on NATO and on the direct election of the President, effectively denying the people of Slovakia their constitutionally guaranteed right to register their views through a referendum. Defending its actions, members of the Prime Minister's party insisted that they acted in conformity with the constitution--as they interpreted it--and that they were justified in placing their views ahead of the ruling of the highest court in the land. 
The actions of the ruling coalition in the case of Frantisek Gaulieder makes clear that the Meciar government has a profound and fundamental disregard for the constitution of Slovakia. 
Then there is the case of Frantisek Gaulieder. 
Frantisek Gaulieder is a member of the Slovak Parliament who was removed from office because he renounced his membership in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. On July 25, the Constitutional Court confirmed that the ruling coalition's action which deprived Gaulieder of his seat was unconstitutional and violated Gaulieder's rights. But members of the Prime Minister's coalition again claimed that they, and not the Constitutional Court, have the right to determine what the constitution means, and have declined to act to restore Gaulieder to his seat in Parliament. 
In short, the `supreme binding force' that Ivan Gasparovic spoke of 5 years ago no longer flows from the constitution, but from the will of Vladimir Meciar. 
When there are differences of opinion as to what a constitution means, whether those differences arise between branches of government or between the government and its citizens, in a state operating under the rule of law, it is the job of a constitutional court to interpret what the constitution means--not the Prime Minister or Parliament. Although this principle is taken for granted in many parts of Europe, and was established early in American history by the famous Supreme Court case of Marbury versus Madison, it has apparently not yet been accepted in Slovakia. 
Mr. President, the Slovak Democratic Coalition has moved, four times, to convene a special session of the Parliament in order to implement the decision of the Constitutional Court and restore Frantisek Gaulieder to his seat. Four times, however, Prime Minister Meciar's coalition has boycotted their own Parliament rather than face the following dilemma: restore Gaulieder to his seat--consistent with the Constitutional Court's decision--and risk the chance that others will follow Gaulieder's example and defect from the Prime Minister's party, or vote down the Slovak Democratic Coalition's proposal to restore Gaulieder to his seat and confirm that whatever form of government exists in Slovakia, it is not constitutional democracy, at least not as we understand it. 
Sooner or later, the Slovak Parliament will reconvene. When it acts, or fails to act, on the Gaulieder question, we will know whether Slovakia is committed to becoming a functioning constitutional democracy. If it is not, what it will become is an isolated State under constant international pressure and scrutiny, cut off from a promising and prosperous future by the arrogance and greed of its own leaders. 
As Vladimir Meciar is asked in his weekly news show, what next, Mr. Prime Minister?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 (S. 462). With the passage of this important legislation, the Senate today renews its commitment to ensuring that every American family has a decent, safe and affordable home. The bill builds upon and improves those aspects of the Nation's public and assisted housing programs which are working well and takes dramatic and vital steps to eliminate areas of failure in the system. 
This legislation recognizes that the vast majority of public housing is well-managed and provides over 1 million American families, elderly and disabled with decent, safe and affordable housing. However, housing and social policy concerns, as well as Federal budget constraints, dictate the need for reform. The reform measures contained in S. 462 will reduce the costs of public and assisted housing to the Federal Government by streamlining regulations, facilitating the formation of local partnerships and leveraging additional State, local, and private resources to improve the quality of the existing stock. These changes will help ensure that Federal funds can be used more efficiently in order to serve additional families through the creation of mixed income communities. 
This legislation represents the culmination of over 2 years of a bipartisan, consensus-building effort to enhance and revitalize affordable housing throughout the Nation. This fruitful effort has been led by Senator Connie Mack, chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, whom I salute for his determination and commitment to an informed and reasoned approach in confronting issues of enormous complexity. Senator Mack has sought input from the administration, resident groups, public housing authorities, low-income housing advocates, nonprofit organizations and state and local officials who are responsible for implementing the Federal requirements established by Congress. 
Mr. President, this legislation makes several critical improvements to the Nation's public and assisted housing system. It will protect our residents by maintaining the Brooke amendment, which caps rents at 30-percent of a tenant's income, and mandating tenant participation. It will institute reasonable rent requirements to encourage welfare recipients who currently receive housing subsidies to move to work. It will expand homeownership opportunities for low and moderate income families. The bill will speed the demolition of distressed housing projects through the repeal of the one-for-one replacement requirement. Also, the section 8 tenant-based voucher and certificate programs will be combined into a single, streamlined voucher system. The needless confusion which results from the differing rules and regulations of these two separate programs will be eliminated in order to increase the participation of private landlords in a unified, simplified system 
This legislation recognizes that every American deserves to live in a safe and secure community. To achieve that goal, a number of important provisions have been added to the legislation at my request. The legislation will allow HUD to waive rent and income requirements to permit police officers a lower rent as an inducement to living in public and assisted housing. Loopholes in the current law which allow drug dealers and violent criminals to escape eviction if they commit their crimes off the premises of the public housing authority will be eliminated. In addition, public housing authorities will be judged and rated based on the effectiveness of their anticrime policies, and their coordination with local law enforcement and tenant organizations in developing and implementing anticrime strategies. 
I would like to highlight one important anticrime provision which has recently been added to the legislation. This provision would mandate the exclusion of child molesters and sexually violent predators from receiving Federal housing assistance. In addition, local public housing agencies would be granted access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's [FBI] national database on sexually violent offenders. This improved records access provision is critical to ensuring that these offenders are properly screened out. I would like to thank my colleague Senator Gramm for joining with me in ensuring that the families and children who live in public housing are protected from convicted sex offenders. Senator Gramm's leadership as the sponsor of the Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-236), which established the FBI database, and his diligence in bringing this issue to the attention of the committee are to be commended 
Mr. President, the reform provisions contained in this bill will greatly improve the quality of life of the families residing in public and assisted housing and will help to ensure the long-term viability of our Nation's existing stock of affordable housing. I thank my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee for their hard work and spirit of bipartisan compromise which they have shown throughout the process. I respectfully urge this legislation's speedy passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, to introduce a bill which will authorize the 50 States Circulating Commemorative Coin Program. 
This program, which allows for a temporary change to the reverse side of our quarters starting in the year 1999, has my complete and enthusiastic support. 
Mr. President, I feel it is appropriate as we enter the new millennium to embark on a decade-long celebration honoring each of our 50 States in the order in which they ratified the Constitution and joined the Union. All States shall submit, for final selection by the Secretary of the Treasury, a design befitting the motto or symbol of each State. 
The benefits of this program in promoting State pride on a national level and educating our citizens about our States' unique character and history are substantial. 
In the year 1999, our Nation will be 223 years old. Before our next big celebration marking the tricentennial in the year 2076, we should take time to commemorate the attributes of every State in this Union. 
Through this circulating coin program, we will be giving American youth an opportunity to cultivate an interest in the rich history that formed these United States. These coins will provide our teachers with a tangible tool to instill this interest. 
The educational advantage for our children will not only be achieved in classrooms, but on playgrounds and in homes around the Nation. 
In addition, Mr. President, I feel that the excitement and anticipation of the different coins in this program will also capture the interest of adults. Just imagine, receiving a collectible memento when you are handed your change. 
And may I point out, Mr. President, while the entire set of 50 circulating quarters will cost only $12.50, this very affordable collection will generate a minimum of $2.6 billion and conceivably as much as $5 billion in additional earnings for the Treasury. These off-budget earnings will be applied directly to reduce borrowing to fund the national debt. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Congressman Michael Castle, who has worked tirelessly to promote this great program. Identical legislation Mike Castle sponsored passed the House on a record vote of 413 to 6. I am pleased that his efforts to create this commemorative coin are about to be realized. His outstanding leadership and dedication on this matter has been an inspiration to all who have committed their support. 
As chairman of the Banking Committee, I intend to press for prompt passage of this broadly supported bill and I am pleased to be a cosponsor.

Mr. DAMATO. I thank the managers of the bill. Mr. President, let me say this. I strongly, strongly support this amendment. I want to commend Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats for fighting to give the families, the parents, the youngsters in the Washington, DC, public school system a chance. Too many are trapped. We are talking about working families who don't have the ability to move to areas with better schools. They don't have the financial wherewithal to send their children to better schools, including private schools, that are safer and may give a stronger educational opportunity. Al Smith, a great Governor from our State, used to say, `Let's look at the record.' Well, look at the record. How can we be defending the status quo of an education system in the District of Columbia that has been a failure--a failure. Forty percent of these youngsters never graduate from high school; 40% of D.C. public school students leave the school system between ninth grade and graduation. 
In terms of scores, it's incredible: during the 1996-97 school year, 72 percent of the eighth graders score below basic in math--72 percent; 78 percent of the D.C. public school fourth graders rank below basic reading achievement levels in 1994; 80 percent of the D.C. fourth graders in 1996 achieved below the basic math achievement levels. 
Do we want to save these youngsters? Or are we so interested in protecting the status of the unions, because that is what this is about. We are talking about the status quo, where you have a system that cares more about tenure for teachers that can't teach, more about seeing that the perks and privileges of the unions are protected--as opposed to providing students and their parents an opportunity to have a choice for real opportunity and to break out of this mediocrity. 
The fact is, we once had great and vibrant public educational institutions. That was before the days when the union perks and prerequisites came first. 
I support merit pay for good teachers. Let's reward them and get rid of the tenure system that is guaranteed to provide mediocrity and less for students. Let's have renewable tenure. 
Parents should be empowered to make choices, letting them have the opportunity to send their kids to the best schools. 
Who is trapped in the sea of mediocrity? I will tell you. The poorest of the poor; the working families; the families that can't move to another area to give their kids a good educational opportunity. 
I have to tell you something. I look to Congressman Floyd Flake. The Reverend Flake is resigning his position. He is elected with 90-some-odd-plus percent when he runs. He truly is the servant of the people. This is not intended to be a testimonial to him. I will give that before October 15 when he retires. But let me tell you about one of the things that the Congressman is going to do. He is going to go back and fight in New York to empower parents and to give children and their parents choice and an educational opportunity that now is all but put aside. 
We can make a difference. I don't care if it is 1,000 students that it helps, or 1,500 students. That is 1,500 more youngsters who will get a chance to flourish in an oasis of educational opportunity as opposed to a swamp and a sea of mediocrity that are tearing down educational opportunities for kids. 
We have got to try to do something better. And it isn't putting more of this money into a system that is broken down. 
Mr. President, I say this is the least we can do. This is an innovative opportunity to take one of the worst school systems in America and to begin to empower parents on behalf of their children to give them real educational opportunity. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring legislation that will commemorate the physical as well as spiritual triumph over one of our Nation's most tragic legacies. This legislation is designed to help the National Park Service present a dramatic chapter in American history; the perseverance of the quest for liberty that saw hundreds of thousands risk their lives so that they might live free. The National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom Act, S. 887, will give, for the first time, Federal recognition and acknowledgment to this avenue of hope for those who sought freedom from tyranny and oppression. 
The Underground Railroad was a loosely organized system of escape routes for hundreds of thousands of enslaved African-Americans. Average men and women, who shared a love of freedom and a hatred of the institution of slavery, committed themselves to help free a people by offering food, shelter, clothing, money, or whatever would assist passengers along the Underground Railroad. Typically, a stop along the Underground Railroad would be a farmhouse or a church where passengers would be hidden in the attic or the basement, or behind false walls or even under floorboards. A person on the railroad would be concealed until it was determined that it was safe to travel to the next site. This scenario was repeated over and over again until the passenger reached safety in the North or in Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean. 
Although largely clandestine, the Underground Railroad is a tangible example of the extent that resistance to slavery existed during the 18th and 19th centuries. Indeed, some 380 sites--28 of which are in New York--have been documented in a National Park Service study as sites potentially significant to the Underground Railroad movement. It is likely that there are more sites about which we will never know. Of the sites that do exist, it is important to highlight their role in abetting the elimination of the shameful practice of slavery. 
It is important to our national heritage that we recognize and remember the bravery of those who risked their lives to make the journey along the Underground Railroad and those who provided sanctuary to them. This legislation will help raise awareness about these locations along the Underground Railroad, enhancing the chances that the sites will be maintained or restored. We must recognize and preserve these historic sites, which represent the extraordinary efforts, perils, sacrifices, and triumphs of those who risked their lives so that they might taste freedom. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important measure.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support swift passage of H.R. 2248. This bill is identical to the bill that I introduced along with Senator Sarbanes as original cosponsor. Both bills authorize the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to His All Holiness, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Orthodox Christian Church. 
It is fitting that we recognize the tremendous leadership this religious figure provides to nearly 300 million people worldwide during his upcoming visit to our country. 
While many consider countries such as Russia and Greece to be Orthodox Christian strongholds, the fact is that nearly 5 million United States citizens of Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbian descent are Orthodox Christians. The contributions of these Americans to our rich history and culture exemplify the values, ideals, and dreams of this great Nation. 
The Patriarch Bartholomew has followed a calling in his life--to selflessly serve not only people of Greek origin, but millions of believers from all over the world, through his strong faith. 
Patriarch Bartholomew was enthroned as the 270th spiritual leader of the Orthodox Christians in 1991. This new title came with enormous responsibilities and burdens. But, the Patriarch Bartholomew was prepared to meet the task. Not only has he fulfilled the demanding role as preeminent leader of Orthodox Christians, he has dedicated himself and used his station to promote worthy, noble causes. 
Mr. President, in the name of religious unity and cooperation, Patriarch Bartholomew is working to promote interfaith dialog between the Orthodox Church, and the Roman Catholic Church, leading Protestant denominations, Muslim leaders, and various other faiths. 
He has also sought to strengthen the bonds between Judaism and Orthodox Christianity. In 1994, the Patriarch worked side by side with Rabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation to cosponsor the Peace and Tolerance Conference, bringing together Christians, Jews, and Muslims for human and religious freedom. 
And Patriarch Bartholomew's compassion is far-reaching. In the war-torn countries of the Balkans, he has helped to advance reconciliation among Catholic, Muslim, and Orthodox communities. 
As a citizen of Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew is deeply concerned about the need to sustain the cause of peace. He has been a dynamic leader in efforts to ease Greek-Turkish tensions and to promote international cooperation, adherence to international law, and respect for human rights of victims of aggression. 
Mr. President, Patriarch Bartholomew, also referred to as the `Green Patriarch' has a sincere commitment to the environmental legacy we will one day leave to our children. Together with global leaders, he convened an international environmental symposium emphasizing the health and well-being of the world's oceans. The Patriarch is also a cosponsor of an annual conference addressing the protection of our global environment. 
Mr. President, in October of this year, Patriarch Bartholomew will visit the United States to offer his spiritual message of unity, compassion, and brotherhood. It is my belief that Congress should honor the work of this great leader in recognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions to religious freedom, tolerance, world peace, environmental protection, and human rights. 
In closing, Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal upon a visionary for our times, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I would also like to take the opportunity to extend thanks to my 48 colleagues in the Senate who have lent their bipartisan support to this effort.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will protect tens of millions of consumers who carry bank debit cards, as well as millions more who are being targeted by banks to use this relatively new and unfamiliar payment card. This bill extends to the users of debit cards the protections that now already apply to users of credit cards. And I would like to thank my colleagues, Senators Bennett, Dodd, and Bryan, for cosponsoring this important legislation. 
In the past few years, millions of Americans have opened envelopes from their banks to find these new payment cards. These cards look like credit cards. They have `VISA' or `MasterCard' logos on the front of them--I am holding one up now--but they are actually debit cards, or, in the language of the industry, they are `off-line' debit cards. They are called `off-line' cards because they can be used with just a signature, and no PIN No., in order to access the consumer's bank account directly. 
These off-line cards combine the convenience of a credit card with the simplicity of an ATM card. In order to make a purchase, the consumer simply presents the debit card to a merchant and signs a sales slip. The money for the payment is then automatically withdrawn from the consumer's bank account and transferred to the merchant. 
But if an off-line card is lost or stolen, it poses a little known and potentially unlimited danger to the consumer. Because it needs only a signature to authorize a purchase, a criminal who finds the card or who steals the card can easily use it to make purchases. He can go on a wild shopping spree and buy thousands of dollars worth of goods on that stolen card. 
But unlike a stolen credit card, these fraudulent charges are immediately deducted from the victim's bank account. And unlike a stolen credit card, the law provides virtually no limit to the victim's liability. 
And what happens to the consumer whose bank account is cleaned out by fraud? Soon her checks begin bouncing, bills go unpaid, late charges and overdraft fees pile up, suddenly the victim is facing financial disaster. Unraveling this mess can mean weeks of letters and phone calls, and nobody will compensate the victim for the lasting damage to his or her name or reputation. 
Furthermore, the victim will be literally penniless until the bank investigates the theft and, hopefully, restores the account. 
Under current law, the bank could take up to 20 days to complete this investigation. Imagine losing one's entire bank balance and then being unable to write a check for rent, car payment or groceries for 20 days. 
Mr. President, I am concerned that consumers do not understand the off-line debit card. They may think it is just like an ordinary ATM card. But without the protection of a secret PIN number, the card is not secure. In reality, it is a direct line of access to the consumer's bank account. That line of access is open to anyone who possesses the card, including a thief. Just the number on the face of the card is all the thief needs to totally drain the consumer's bank account. 
Financial institutions have sent out tens of millions of these cards unsolicited in the last few years. By 1994, there were 25 million off-line cards in circulation. By 1996, the number had jumped to more than 60 million. Millions more will be mailed out this year, because although banks cannot legally mail out an unsolicited credit card, a loophole in the law allows them to mail out these unsolicited off-line debit cards as replacements for consumer's ATM cards. 
Mr. President, this is a ticking time bomb for millions of unwary consumers. Does the consumer understand how this new card differs from an ordinary ATM card? Does the consumer understand the risk that comes from carrying the new off-line card? Too often the answer is no. A recent survey by Mastercard found that 59 percent of the consumers who carry debit cards do not realize just how important it is to report a lost or stolen card immediately. At a minimum, consumers need to be warned before they start carrying these off-line cards, and they need protection in the event that anything goes wrong. 
Mr. President, we need reform and we need it soon. The bill we have introduced today, the Debit Card Consumer Protection Act of 1997, provides a level of protection that is clearly needed. 
First, it prohibits the banks from mailing out unsolicited debit cards. Only people who want these cards should be getting them in the mail. 
Second, it requires a clear disclosure to the consumer that the card provides a direct line of access to the consumer's bank account. 
Third, it prohibits the bank from sending out live debit cards. Cards must not be valid for use until the recipient identifies himself or herself as the rightful owner. 
Fourth, it limits the consumer's liability to $50 in the event the card is lost or stolen. 
Fifth, it expedites the restoration of funds to the consumer's account within 5 business days. Current law can make the consumer wait 20 business days. 
Mr. President, this bill would bring the consumer protection laws up to date and into line with what the consumer is entitled to and expects. That is why consumer groups strongly support this bill, including the Consumer Federation of America, the Consumers Union, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. These organizations have all gone on record to say that this legislation provides essential protection for users of debit cards. 
Now, Mr. President, some of the provisions of this bill were recently put forth in another bill, S. 1154, by my colleague, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, who I see is on the floor. And some of these measures are now being implemented voluntarily by the industry. I want to commend Senator Reed for his work in this area. I think that a consensus exists that consumer protections are needed to improve a situation that presents a very real risk for millions of consumers. 
In fact, MasterCard and VISA recently announced that they will voluntarily cap the consumer's liability at $50 in the event of an unauthorized use. One bank, Bank of America, has announced it will not hold consumers liable for any unauthorized charges. I commend the industry for responding to these concerns. Because of this responsiveness, I am hopeful the industry will vigorously support legislation to make these essential consumer protection laws permanent and universal. 
Finally, I thank Senators Bennett, Dodd, and Bryan for cosponsoring this bill. Senator Bennett, as chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology, is very aware of the enormous impact financial fraud is having on the industry and consumers. This legislation will help to protect both the industry and consumers from having to pay these high costs.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a truly outstanding, dedicated public servant--David Schmeltzer. Dave is retiring from the Federal Government after 35 years of service, including 25 years at the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, where he is the Director of the Office of Compliance. Over the years I have been fortunate to have gotten to know Dave personally. A native New Yorker, he received a bachelor of arts degree from Long Island University in 1957. He attended Brooklyn Law School with my dear friend Larry Elovich, and became a member of the New York Bar after graduating in 1960. I want to wish Dave, his wife Louise, and their son Daniel and his family the best of luck on this happy occasion. 
David Schmeltzer has had a truly remarkable career in Federal service. I am unaware of anyone with Dave's experience and knowledge when it comes to product safety regulation and enforcement. At the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, in addition to his current position as Director of the Office of Compliance, Dave has served as both Deputy General Counsel and Acting General Counsel. Before joining the Commission in 1973--at its inception, I should note--Dave served as the Assistant Chief Counsel for Enforcement and Administrative Law with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He has also served as the Vice Chairman for the International Consumer Health and Safety Organization Symposium [ICPHSO] and is presently on ICPHSO's executive committee. 
While the list of Government positions Dave has held is quite impressive, it does not begin to measure his contributions in improving product safety for all Americans of all ages, from infants to our seniors. Dave has never been someone who has ducked the tough calls, and he has been willing to take the heat for doing so when many others would have run away. He has always been fair and balanced in exercising his judgment, a real straight shooter. The results speak for themselves. On behalf of those consumers who have been spared the pain of a loss or devastating injury to a child or other loved one, I want to thank Dave Schmeltzer for his years of service and wish him well in his future endeavors.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, first of all, let me say, as well-intentioned as the legislation of the Senator from Arkansas is, I believe it presents a number of obstacles. I think while there are those of us who are concerned with respect to undue Federal intrusion, that is not so in the American Heritage Rivers Program because it is a program that by its very implementation must take place through the initiatives of the local communities. 
This is not a question where the President or Washington or Big Brother designates a river and says, `I want this river to be in the program.' This program comes about as a result of the initiatives of the State and local governments. 
For example, in New York, Governor Pataki has recommended that the Hudson River be one of those rivers that applies for designation. Indeed, they have. Not only has the request come from the State, but it really has come as a result of dozens and dozens of communities and community groups along the Hudson River petitioning to be part of this process, that will help ongoing initiatives including the Hudson River Estuary Management Program, the Hudson River Greenway Program, local waterfront revitalization programs. Again, dozens of communities and cities want to be part of this process. 
The fact is that the State is ready to spend, along with this and local initiatives, some $75 million on the Hudson River. 
What we are talking about is enhanced services to deliver the kind of upgrading that will bring an improvement of services to the people on the river. If this amendment were enacted, we might well see an entire program that is ready for implementation and that involves local initiatives thwarted, only because the initiative is a voluntary program that is locally driven and community based. 
Now, some of the requirements that this legislation would bring about would have the effect of denying access to and tying up the process. To notify property owners in a 10-mile area and take comment--and I see my colleague says that is not necessary; maybe he would like to address that--but the burdens placed upon implementation, and the fact we get into this process of having to designate raises concerns. Would Congress have to designate 10 rivers annually? And should that really be the province of Congress, to say which of these rivers should be part of this program? Now, I believe in the separation of powers. I think it is absolutely essential. But I am wondering how we would go about that. Really, shouldn't it be the State and local governments petitioning the executive branch and having various requirements that they must meet? 
And, of course, we may or may not agree with the selection modality. I am not suggesting that we just sign off. Obviously, we as representatives of our States and communities want to be in a position to see that there is fairness. That is why we are here, to keep some balance in the allocation of resources. I don't know whether or not we should be the people who, on an annual basis, authorize the selection process of 10 rivers. I think that really should lie within the province of the executive branch having to meet some kind of competitive standard. 
We are very excited by this Presidential initiative. Let's be very candid here. The Governor of New York and the President of the United States, in terms of political philosophy, have not always lined up on the same side. Indeed, I say, on many occasions, they take opposite points of view. So I think it is important when the Governor points out that this is an opportunity for a State-Federal partnership on a basis that makes sense without there being undue intrusion--because we reject undue intrusion. There is a process that is underway. Now, I can just imagine, if the Hudson River isn't designated, we will probably launch a hue and cry as to why not. Of course, that is part of the process. If it is not designated and we think it should be, we would be prepared to ask those questions. That is part of democracy; that is part of the process. 
No one has the absolute, and no one's decisions and actions can go without the risk of being challenged in the court of public opinion, and that is what we would be doing. But I have every reason to believe, notwithstanding the political differences and philosophical differences, for the most part, we will get reasonable decisions. I think some of these issues are going to be very easy. There are some bodies of water where the local governments and State officials are anxious and can put forth a good case to be designated. Then they will get down to areas where it gets competitive and where reasonable people might disagree. Are we going to say there won't be some politics entering into it? Of course, there will be. But it will be right here on this floor within this body, I note, to the chagrin of many. The Presiding Officer would not believe that. But I can attest to the fact that I believe that would be the case, in my limited experience in observing these matters in the course of the past 17 years. And so it would be in the House of Representatives. 
Taking the political jockeying that would take place in terms of designating these rivers between the House and the Senate, that would really be a lulu. You know, there is something called the rights of the minority, which this body in particular ensures, and I like that. I think it is important. Even though we may have legislation and the majority supports it, oftentimes, I think it is a necessary and important right. I think if we were to reflect on the history of this body, we would find that sometimes those who are not in the majority have held up legislative initiatives and, in the fullness of time, it has come out that they were correct. So it is not bad. But I want to say that it could be used in the manner which would make it difficult to get designations of the kinds of rivers that should be qualified. 
So I will be, of course, forced to move to table this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Dodd at the appropriate time. I don't intend to do that until my colleagues have an opportunity to express themselves.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from Washington in a colloquy on the importance of the Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Conservation Program to the people of New York, as well as the entire country. 
Mr. President, I would first like to acknowledge the fact that Chairman Gorton has crafted a good bill under difficult circumstances. This bill combines a number of different agencies and functions within a tight budget cap, and I appreciate his effort to balance these different needs. 
Mr. President, the Weatherization Program upgrades the energy efficiency of the homes of the poor, elderly, and disabled in this Nation. This is important in warm and cold climates alike, providing people with long-term solutions to housing affordability. This program is highly effective with low administrative costs. The State Energy Conservation Program permits States to target energy programs in all sectors of the economy, from making schools and hospitals more energy efficient to promoting alternative motor fuels and renewable energy. This program is highly leveraged with large amounts of State, local, and private funding. As the country moves forward to restructure the electric industry, these two programs will be all the more important to meet the needs of low-income families. 
Mr. President, the committee's bill provides $5 million more than the House-passed bill for weatherization and $1.1 million more than the House for the State Energy Conservation Program. I would like to urge Senator Gorton to stand firm in support of the Senate numbers in conference with the House.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Flood Insurance Reauthorization Act of 1997 (NFIRA). This legislation provides for a simple and straightforward 5-year extension of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) which is scheduled to expire on September 30, 1997. This legislation will ensure that this important program is placed on a steady and secure foundation to continue the invaluable protection it provides to flood insurance policyholders and the Federal taxpayers. I am pleased that my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, the distinguished ranking member of the Banking Committee, has cosponsored this measure. 
The National Flood Insurance Program, which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], enables over 3.5 million American families to insure their homes and possessions. In my home State of New York, 85,000 families participate in the NFIP. The NFIP allows these families, on Long Island and along the Great Lakes and the State's many rivers, to purchase adequate insurance coverage to protect their homes in the event of a catastrophic flood. 
The NFIP employs a comprehensive approach to alleviating the risks posed by catastrophic floods. Floodplain communities participate in FEMA's Community Rating System and are offered incentives to adopt and enforce measures to reduce the risk of flood damage and improve flood prevention building criteria. To avoid the danger of repetitive losses, the program provides stringent building standards, including increased elevation, designed to reduce the risk of future damage. These flood protection standards must be met before any structure which suffers substantial damage may be rebuilt. In addition, persons who receive disaster assistance and fail to subsequently purchase flood insurance are barred from receiving future assistance. 
Mr. President, the NFIP plays a critical role in reducing the costs of Federal disaster relief. Current NFIP policyholders pay approximately $1.3 billion annually into the NFIP fund. Without this premium income, the Federal Government would likely pay spiraling costs in disaster relief. The NFIP has the added benefits of improving State and community planning and Federal support for locally driven disaster prevention and mitigation activities. 
Reauthorizing the NFIP is an important step forward in reaffirming the commitment of the Federal Government to help American families protect their homes and to protect the Federal taxpayer from the risks of catastrophic floods. Clearly, we must do more. Lenders and private insurers who participate in the NFIP must do more to ensure compliance. States and local communities must improve their disaster planning, prevention, and response activities. FEMA must redouble its efforts to increase participation in the program to improve the safety and soundness of the NFIP fund. Also, the Federal Government must do more to prevent and mitigate against the losses which will inevitably occur from future floods. 
Mr. President, I note that this bill is supported by the administration. I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of this legislation and I look forward to working with the members of the Banking Committee to ensure a swift and speedy passage.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend the chairman for his continued leadership in providing substantial support for the Ryan White CARE Act, research through the National Institutes of Health, and various prevention and education programs seeking to discover new treatments and a cure for the HIV/AIDS virus. Each of these areas deserves the full attention from congressional leaders if we are to finally win our struggle with this dreaded virus. 
However, I am particularly concerned that the level of funding for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program [ADAP] under title II of the Ryan White CARE Act will fail to meet the needs of those suffering from this terrible disease. With some of the recent advances in HIV/AIDS drug treatments, many seem to believe that the pressure imposed by this disease upon our society has been relieved. However, I believe the Senate must increase the ADAP funding level for fiscal year 1998 to the House level of $132 million in order to protect our citizens from this continued deadly disease. 
As with every State, in my State of New York many working people living with HIV/AIDS must rely on the ADAP Program for their only access to the new effective combination therapy AIDS medications which were discovered and produced through our public and private investment in research at the National Institutes of Health and in private industry. These newly approved drugs offer real hope for continued life to hundreds of thousands of Americans living with HIV/AIDS. With millions of Americans lacking health insurance with adequate prescription benefits, the ability to access these treatments has literally become a matter of life and death for thousands of these Americans. 
Currently, the ADAP Program in New York State provides treatment opportunities to nearly 17,000 people with many, many more projected to seek treatment in the future. Congress has the ability to lead the way to assure access to these therapies and the hope they provide against the inescapable progression to an untimely death. We must seize this opportunity. No one wants to be in the position of telling a constituent that they are out of luck this year and that maybe next year we can do something. Every State will face intolerable choices in deciding who shall have the opportunity to receive these life-saving treatments without an adequate ADAP funding level. I ask the chairman to leave no stone unturned in obtaining the funds so desperately needed for us to offer a chance for life to every American living with HIV/AIDS in the United States. I know my 
colleague from California would like to provide further emphasis to this statement.

Mr. President, we again thank the chairman for his leadership and support of the Ryan White CARE Act in the past. We hope to secure your continued support for Senate appropriations for titles III, IV, and V of the Ryan White CARE Act, and at least the House funding levels for titles I and II in conference committee. In particular, the ADAP funding level affects every State in our great Nation and, therefore, I look forward to working with him and our colleagues to ensure that every American will have access to any HIV/AIDS treatment he or she may require.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in order to offer support for the principles outlined in the legislation submitted by my friend from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton. This amendment begins to bring about some very needed reform to give youngsters in our public education institutions, particularly so many in our large metropolitan areas and our inner core cities, the needed reforms that are long overdue. 
What we are saying is that we want to see to it that the money gets into the classroom, that we empower good teachers to teach, that we give to the local districts the opportunity to direct the resources they need. 
The amendment combines all of the Federal funds devoted to education, with several large exceptions, into block grants. The Secretary of Education is then required to distribute the consolidated funds directly to each school district through a formula outlined in the bill. Now, under this innovative approach, the Federal funds will be distributed directly to school districts, and it will be used in classrooms and no longer will Washington bureaucrats be dictating how schools use scarce resources. We need to empower local educators, and more importantly, parents and teachers, with the ability to bring the kind of education to youngsters that has been lost to many for so long. 
I feel very strongly that we have to maximize resources and to return to citizens the ability to give educational opportunity to their children. It is clear that this country has now begun a long overdue debate on the future of public education, and I strongly believe that we need fundamental reforms that will give to our children what they need and deserve. 
I have proposed five fundamental reforms which I hope we can make part of our educational mission, not necessarily by legislation, but as guiding principles. 
First, you cannot give youngsters an educational opportunity unless we get violent and disruptive juveniles out of the classrooms so that teachers can teach and good students can learn. 
A little over a week ago there was an article in the New York Times about crime in the schools, and according to New York City Chancellor Rudy Crew, last year there was a total of 22,615 reported--I say `reported' because we don't know how many were unreported--incidents including one murder, 221 sexual assaults including rape, and nearly 1,000 other physical assaults. That is outrageous. We are talking about schools that are supposed to be sanctuaries and havens for our children. How can teachers teach good youngsters with that taking place? Yet in district after district, State after State, we find parents unable to secure for their children a safe environment. Disruptive juveniles are permitted to stay in the classroom and create chaos to keep others from getting the education that they deserve. How can good teachers teach in those kinds of circumstances? 
Second, talking about good teachers--and there are many, many--how do we reward good teachers when they are all treated the same? It is about time we rewarded outstanding teachers for their good performance with merit pay. What do we hear in response to that? I hear the president of the teachers' union say, `We are opposed to merit pay.' Imagine, opposed to giving merit pay to good teachers. 
Instead, what the union does is protect its own perks without making determinations about rewarding good teachers. We have outmoded tenure systems in State after State. In my State, the teachers' union protects incompetence, notwithstanding that the school board associations have begged, have pleaded, have said give us renewable tenure, tenure for 5 years so that we can review someone's performance. Now we lock in incompetence. We reward it. You have unions that are more interested in protecting the perks and the privileges of their members, not rewarding outstanding teachers, those teachers who come in early, those teachers who work with our youngsters, those teachers who stay after school, who give additional thought, who are inspirations--and there are so many. No, they are not rewarded with merit pay, but incompetents are protected. 
We need to give parents more control over their children's education, and that means letting parents choose which public 
school in their own school districts their children can attend. Bring about competition. Do not assign, particularly working poor families, to the worst of public education systems without the choice or without the ability or without the financial means to give their children an educational opportunity, but give them choice. 
By the way, in areas where this has been effected, it has worked. It has worked in East Harlem, and it can work elsewhere. In fact, there are at least four other examples of New York districts that are experimenting with similar interdistrict programs, and they work. It will let us empower parents to make educational choices for their children, and particularly those who are not of great affluence. 
Finally, we need to put our children first and stand up to those special interests, which are teachers unions that are more interested in pay and perks than they are in good education for our children, and reward those teachers who are excellent and should deserve that recognition. I am strongly supportive of the principles of this amendment. 
I have to ask my good friend and colleague, though, Senator Gorton, what, if anything, in the bill will see to it that the districts that will be receiving these moneys will not be impaired and that they will get at least as much in terms of funding under this proposal as they received in the past? I think that is a very important element.  
Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. It certainly does. Mr. President, once again, I want to commend Senator Gorton for his willingness to look at a problem that he has worked on for a long time, in terms of solving it, and having that flexibility of recognizing that there are complexities and ways to deal with this. I applaud the modification that the Senator has indicated he is willing to make because we now assure against the argument that, `Oh, this may cost us money.' Indeed, I think what the implementation of his legislative proposals will demonstrate is that not only do you get at least the amount of money that we are talking about now, but absent the red tape, absent the administration--both from Washington and at the local levels, that schools are burdened with, hours and hours, and thousands of people nationwide who are just working on filling out forms and sending them back and forth --those wasted hours and resources can be used and directed much better to meet the educational needs that our youngsters have. We are talking about empowering the local districts, parents, and good teachers to utilize these scarce resources. 
It is literally finding over $1.5 billion. That is what the import of the Senator's message is here, giving that kind of resource; and, more important than just the money, is the tools to direct how these moneys will best be used, the resources to give the best education to youngsters--maybe determine in certain areas they need more computers, maybe in another area they need more books, maybe in another area there are some remedial requirements that are necessary. Whatever it is, those decisions should be made by the parents, by the educators, by the local superintendents, by the local districts, and not on high from Washington and not burdened with all kinds of reporting requirements that do nothing to educate our kids. 
So, if the Senator goes forward with that, I commend him for his initial undertaking and for the fact that he has demonstrated that he has a willingness to meet the needs of the entire educational community and see to it that the resources get there, and that no one can make the argument, `Oh, in my school district our children will not get the resources that they are entitled to, or they will get less.' This modification that he suggests will assure that. I am deeply appreciative of his sensitivity; more important, of his leadership in this important area. 
There is no area more vital. Our public educational institutions, on the elementary level, have been suffering mightily throughout this country, particularly in the large metropolitan areas and our inner core cities, since so many working families are deprived of choice, are deprived of opportunity, are deprived of giving their youngsters a good education that we have had in the past. 
I might make one comment. I am struck by the deterioration in our public schools, again: Because of disruptive students--you can't get them out of class; you should be able to get them out of class--because we have not given and empowered good teachers with the kind of recognition and good pay that they need, because we have protected incompetents with outmoded tenure laws, because we stripped away the ability to make choices. 
When my dad was in elementary school 75 years ago, when he first entered elementary school--and it was even a little more than that, almost 80 years ago--he didn't speak a word of English. His mom and pop had just come to this country. They lived in a ghetto, in a poor community. No one spoke English there. When he went to grammar school he flunked English right throughout. But he had teachers who were dedicated, willing, who persevered. And they were interested in giving those youngsters who came from all kinds of diverse backgrounds the best education. Let me tell you, disruptive kids--and they had disruptive kids--were not tolerated, nor their conduct. 
As a result of that, over a period of time, going to summer school and with help, he graduated, went on to a State teachers college. He majored in English because the people who worked with him were an inspiration to him. That is the story of so many of our grandparents and parents, who had that great educational opportunity in our public schools. That is an opportunity that all too often, in too many of our communities, is lacking. It is one that we have an obligation to fight for and to bring about. We have to empower local educators, local decisions, parents, so the good children can get that opportunity that was available many years ago and unfortunately, in too many cases, is not available now. 
So I commend the Senator for his excellent amendment and his initiatives and look forward to working with him.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from New Mexico, and I agree with him. I also think that the Senator from Arizona does us a great service by saying, look, this may not be the methodology, the best method of paying for the training of our doctors, but, having said that, that is the system that exists. The legislation that the Senator's amendment would affect is designed, maybe imperfectly, to begin to reduce those expenditures, those moneys that come out of the Treasury. 
Let me say this to you: It is not fair to say that we are paying for doctors that are not going to be in training and, indeed, again, the proposal that the administration has put forth and that the committee has expanded that goes beyond New York and now nationwide, those dollars will be used to provide adjustment assistance, because as these hospitals downsize, they are going to have to hire additional staff doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other personnel to replace the residents who now treat Medicare patients. 
So this is a canard to simply say we are giving you money not to train doctors. It is transition and, in the fullness of time, will save the taxpayers, depending upon who is doing the scoring, as much as $350 million. You can't knock a program on one hand and say you are paying all this money and we should reduce it, and when you come up with a methodology to reduce it then say, `Oh, no, that's not the right methodology.' 
Show us a way in which you do that and don't throw the teaching hospitals into chaos. This is the manner that I would suggest, as imperfect as it may be, that the committee came up with. For those reasons, I hope that we will refrain from piling on and supporting the McCain amendment which does not help the situation.

Again, I do hope we can find a better way to fund this, because I don't think people know that the Federal Government put so much money into teacher training. If there is a better way to fund it and finance it, I think we should look for that.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to join with the distinguished ranking member and the senior Senator from New York, the ranking member on Finance and the chairman of Finance, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, in opposing the McCain amendment. 
Let me say that the rhetoric is rather fascinating, the rhetoric that is used in support of this amendment, that we are paying for something that we are not getting. The fact of the matter is that it totally ignores the reality that teaching hospitals that administer to the poorest of the poor, that provide training for our Nation's doctors, that provide medical services to those who would otherwise in many cases find it difficult to get those services, will actually be saving the taxpayer money as a result of the legislation that has been enacted, a legislation which the amendment that we are now discussing would strike down. 
The fact is the Congressional Budget Office as recently as this morning has scored the McCain proposal as one that would cost the Treasury $350 million. So it is rather disingenuous to say that we are paying for something, in the rhetoric which is used, to suggest that `Government rationing of medical training, ultimately the rationing of health care, smacks of socialism, not democracy' does not recognize the problem that exists. 
It costs approximately $100,000 a year. That is what the Government is paying, for every resident who is employed at the various hospitals throughout the country. There is a recognition that there is an oversupply. So the Congress, with the administration, developed a format whereby over a period of time, hospitals would reduce the number of doctors and would actually be then saving the Government $350 million. 
Now, if we want to continue business as usual, want to continue subsidizing the oversupply, then we strike this amendment. That is what the Senator would be doing. What he would be doing is absolutely in contravention of what good planning and what good medical practice and what is in the best interests of the taxpayer--allow this amount to gradually go down in the number of doctors who are being trained. 
Now, I understand the Senator from Arizona has asked for the ability to debate this measure later in a fuller context and would like an hour equally divided. At that point in time I hope the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, would raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act because that point of order, in my opinion, lies, it is proper, and would request a ruling of the Chair. I am not going to do that. I hope we would have the chairman of the Budget Committee review this as to whether or not technologically this would cost the taxpayers $350 million and there is no offset provided. 
Now, do we really want to say we want to knock out a program that will reduce the number of doctors and save the taxpayers of this country close to half a billion dollars? That is what the McCain amendment would do, as well-intentioned as it might be. And believe me, I do not question the Senator's intentions. I think he has a legitimate point. 
Are we paying for something that we are not getting? I think the fact is we are going to be reducing the supply and we will be saving $350 million but we are doing it in an orderly manner. We are allowing those who are on the battlefield, those who are providing services for the neediest of the needy, for those who do not have adequate health insurance, those people who would otherwise not receive the kinds of medical services and high quality, they are in our inner core cities throughout our Nation because those are the hospitals in most cases that will be affected, the great institutions in our metropolitan communities throughout this country. 
It makes no sense, it seems to me, to knock out a program that will deprive us of the opportunity of seeing an orderly downsizing, and, yes, save taxpayers money at the same time. 
I join in opposition to this amendment and I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee from Delaware and my distinguished colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, once again, we have seen the ugly, undeniably brutal, horrific actions of terrorism. We have seen the destructive impact of it in Jerusalem so vividly put forth over the TV screens, but it goes well beyond. We are told that 6 people died, over 150 have been injured, and obviously our sympathy goes out to them and to their families and to the people of that region who are held captive by these kinds of terrorist attacks. This is the work of Hamas, the Hamas who are given sanctuary, who operate out of the territories under the direct control of Yasser Arafat. 
Now, make no mistake about it: The responsibility for this terrorist act and the previous bombings lies with Mr. Arafat. He, Mr. President, has the power to deter these murderers but does nothing. Indeed, he gives them sanctuary. He gives them sustenance. He gives them comfort. 
Let me illustrate by way of this picture. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and in this case I think even more so. The New York Times, Thursday, August 21, and here we see Mr. Arafat greeted by a leader of the Hamas during a meeting in Gaza: `Defying Israel, Arafat embraces Islamic militants.' 
You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say, on the one hand, that we are the instrumentality of peace, that we want peace, we are working for peace, and on the other hand be embracing the leaders of the terrorist organizations that are sworn to destroy Israel, the Jewish people and any prospects for peace. 
That is indefensible. And so while there are those who claim that this is an internal security problem for Israel, I believe it is quite clear, given the responsibilities and given the power and given the economic wherewithal that we have provided, the United States, to Yasser Arafat, whose police force has failed, whose security services have, if anything, given sanctuary and protection to Hamas, it is about time we held him accountable for these acts. Instead of providing the security and loaning himself to the peace process, he embraces these murderers as we see so clearly. He coddles them, he provides them with sanctuary. 
Mr. President, terrorism will not end if this is permitted. 
I believe, and I have said before--and I see my colleague in the Chamber--that it may come time--and the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] has raised this issue--for this country to look very closely at the moneys, the hundreds of millions of dollars annually that we send to Mr. Arafat under the umbrella, the cloak, of peace. 
When those dollars are not being used to provide the kind of security to bring about a peace process but are aiding and abetting, and, indeed, we have him embracing terrorist leaders, I think we have to at the very least look at whether this should continue. I believe that we have an obligation to speak up and say, we hold you, Mr. Arafat, responsible, and it is time to condemn him publicly for the carnage and the destruction of human life that has taken place today and in the past. 
Mr. President, I see my friends and colleagues, the Senators from Connecticut and New Jersey, in the Chamber, and I know that they feel strongly about this issue. 
I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from New Jersey.

Do you think that we should consider very seriously going forward with a cutoff of funding to Yasser Arafat and the Palestinians, unless we see some--I am not saying tomorrow or the next day--but unless we see some concerted action? I think we have to begin to let him know. I am wondering what my colleague thinks about that--my colleagues think about that? Because, it seems to me, we say one thing and we do the other. We are permitting, I think, ourselves to look rather foolish in the continued funding, or permitting funding to continue to flow.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I think that this picture and the caption describes it. Here is Yasser Arafat embracing a leader of terrorism, a killer, the leader of Hamas. The caption reads: `Defying Israel, Arafat embraces Islamic militants.' It is better titled: `Defying peace'--defying peace. It is better titled `Embracing terrorists,' because that is exactly what he is doing. 
My colleague from California, I think, described it quite correctly. It is not good enough to speak about peace and yet to give sanctuary, safe haven and tangible, visible support to those who bring about these horrific acts. That is what Mr. Arafat has done. Generally, he has done it under the cloak of speaking in a language and in places and at times where the world does not hear it, but that selected groups hear his words. Here he has done it in the way that the camera has captured him and his words in giving support and comfort to those who bring terror to the streets and to the homes of innocent civilians.

Mr. DAMATO. Madam President, I thank Chairman Specter and the ranking minority member, Senator Harkin, for their incredible stewardship and leadership in developing the 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education appropriations bill. It is one of the most difficult bills that we have to deal with because the needs are so great; the needs for increased medical research, for research in all of the areas, whether it be for breast cancer, whether it be for kidney programs, whether it be for the programs for AIDS research. 
Encompassed in this is how do we share the resources which are so limited? So it really comes down to, unfortunately, choices, of not giving sufficient funding to some of the most critically important areas affecting our health, affecting infants, and affecting all of our populations. 
But there is another population that continues to grow, a population that has not, unfortunately, had their needs met, too. That is our senior citizens. That is why I rise today, on behalf of America's elderly citizens, to increase the title III of the Older Americans Act. I offer an amendment that would increase it by $40 million, for a total of $893 million. The current Older Americans Act funding includes a 2-percent increase. That is 15 percent. That is a cost-of-living increase over last year's allocation. 
Most people would say, `Well, that's not bad in these times of austerity.' I agree. But I think we have to look at the problem. The primary goal of these community services is to keep millions--millions--of frail elderly people living independent in their own homes, in their own apartments, for as long as possible, allowing them to avoid unnecessary institutionalization and saving billions of dollars, not to mention improving their quality of life. 
So the Older Americans Act provides a whole variety of programs, home and community-based services to the elderly, including congregate and home-delivered meals--Meals on Wheels; we have heard of that--transportation so that seniors do not live as shut-ins so they have an opportunity to come together with friends and neighbors, senior employment, senior centers, adult day care and other services. 
Three of these services account for more than two-thirds of the title III funding: Congregate meals, that is $250 million; home-delivered meals, $134 million; and transportation, $63 million. No one can deny the incredible needs and the fact that, if anything, they grow and grow. 
The face of America's population, Mr. President, is changing. It is growing older. Believe it or not, those elderly people who are 85 years of age or older are growing faster than any others. They are growing at a faster rate--85 and older. So when we talk about the needs of the frail elderly and keeping them from being institutionalized, this is becoming an increasing problem. 
The elderly population over age 85 will increase by 36 percent by the year 2005. Think of that; an incredible 36 percent. That is going to call for increased services, increases well beyond what we can imagine and envision today. And unless we do, we are talking about a vulnerable population. They will have no other alternatives in many cases than to be institutionalized. I suggest not only the quality of life of the seniors then becomes degraded to the extent that we do not even like to think about it, but the cost factors will become incalculable. 
The typical Older Americans Act participant, Mr. President, to get a profile of who is that person, is a woman over 75, living on a very limited fixed income, who needs daily help in preparing meals or weekly transportation to a doctor. 
Thirty-nine percent of the Older Americans Act participants have incomes at or below the poverty level. 
Among States, the poverty rates for participants range from 17.2 to 86.9 percent. Twelve States report at least half of their participants have incomes at or below the poverty threshold. 
Mr. President, why is a $40 million increase so desperately needed? Well, despite the steady funding increases, the effect of inflation and the tremendous population growth have diminished the actual impact of the annual appropriations increases. Over the past 15 years, there has been a 40-percent loss in the program's capacity to meet the needs of older citizens due to a combination of the following factors: increased costs due to inflation, serving increased numbers of frail elderly who need more, and reduced Federal funding. 
If inflation and the increasing age population were accounted for from the OAA's start in 1973, we would have had to double the funding. So while the request for doubling the funding level in 1 year is unrealistic, certainly--certainly--the request that we put forth at 5 percent, or $40 million, is one that I believe is extremely conservative and one that I hope we can meet. 
Where do we find the funds? Let me first say the committee has done an excellent job. It has identified funding, an increased funding of $15 million, by reducing the general administrative costs, which amount to about $1 billion, the bureaucracy, the overhead for administering these programs, for the bureaucrats here in Washington and in other areas. I believe that by a further reduction by 5 percent, we can add $40 million. That is a very modest reduction as it relates to overhead. And that is what we intend to do. 
So what we are talking about is making more resources available for people, the frail elderly, people who need it, a population that averages 75 years of age, a population that continues to increase, as opposed to decreasing resources for bureaucrats. 
I believe in the days of computerization, et cetera, and effective efficiency, we can do that. We can actually increase the services with less people by way of attrition, by way of maximizing the efficiency and the effectiveness that one person today can bring to the work force by use of the computer that can do the work of two or three or four. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will strike a blow against counterfeiters and other criminals who commit cellular telephone fraud and credit card fraud. 
These criminal activities cost their respective industries hundreds of millions of dollars annually, and these costs are passed down to consumers who use credit cards and cellular telephones. The cellular telephone industry alone loses $650 million each year due to counterfeit or cloned telephone. The credit card industry faces a similar problem. 
The criminals who perpetrate these frauds use specialized equipment to clone cell phones and credit cards to create phony copies which can be sold on the street or used to rack up thousands of dollars in unauthorized credit card purchases and telephone calls. There is no legitimate reason for an individual to possess this special equipment used to create these phony copies. This equipment is only useful to create counterfeit credit cards and cell phones. 
Under current law, this equipment is actually returned to the criminal after he serves his sentence. The equipment is frequently used again to commit the same crimes over and over. The Government cannot confiscate the equipment without a separate expensive and time-consuming forfeiture proceeding. 
Mr. President, it is preposterous that the Government must return the tools used to commit these crimes to criminals, even if they are convicted. These criminals are exploiting a loophole in the Federal forfeiture laws. My bill will close this loophole. 
My bill would amend title 49 of the United States Code to make this equipment, as well as the counterfeit credit cards and telephones themselves, contraband. This designation would make it a Federal crime to possess these items. My bill would also require that these items must not be returned to the criminals. 
Mr. President, these crimes take a tremendous toll on consumers whose telephones and credit cards are cloned by this equipment. By the time the consumer discovers that his or her telephone or credit card has been copied, the criminals usually have racked up thousands of dollars in unauthorized charges. This can have a devastating effect on consumers' credit ratings, rendering them unable to purchase a car or home or start a business. These problems can take years to correct. 
Last Congress, I introduced a similar bill, S. 1380. Unfortunately, the session ended before Congress was able to act. However, this bill is not without precedent. A similar measure was passed last year regarding counterfeit videos and music. These items are now considered contraband under the new law. Industry leaders and law enforcement authorities enthusiastically support this legislation. 
Mr. President, the Government must stop unwittingly aiding criminals to swindle hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of consumers and the cellular telephone and credit card industries. My bill would close this outrageous loophole and help law enforcement crack down on these brazen criminals.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, may I suggest the absence of a quorum so I will have an opportunity to concur with my colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from New York? Let me say, No. 1, that I totally support his presentation as it related to the manner in which this veto took place. It is something that none of us were apprised of or aware of; that there had been extended negotiations with his administration during this process. It came as a total surprise. But I would like to take one moment and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise this morning, along with Senator Moynihan, to introduce legislation to `disapprove' President Clinton's line-item veto that cancels a Medicaid provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which provides health care to the poorest of the poor in New York. Let me say that that is the legislation which has just been sent to the desk. That is legislation to disapprove this veto. Let me also say that I must speak out not about the authority of the line-item veto, which I support, but about its use in this particular case. 
Mr. President, I have to tell you--and I listened intently to Senator Moynihan making his presentation with respect to the manner in which the entire budget negotiations and the process was conducted. The fact of the matter is that the administration and the President agreed during the budget negotiations to accept the provisions that were included in this bill. 
The fact of the matter is, I believe it was June 25 when these provisions were adopted by the full Senate. Mr. President, there was no secret. The administration knew. The administration had ample time all during that process to say `no', this is unacceptable. 
I have to tell you, I am shocked and outraged that the administration has singled out New York for this particular provision by stating that this is an `item that would have given preferential treatment to only New York.' 
Mr. President, that is blatantly, patently false. It is a total misstatement. 
I hope that the President will have an opportunity to examine this because I believe that his advisers have given him very poor advice. 
I can't believe, knowing the President's commitment to attempt to deal with the problem of the uninsured, particularly the children--he had full knowledge of the manner and the totality of dealing with the shortcomings because we are attempting to reduce the burdens, we are attempting to get our Medicaid and Medicare costs under control. In this bill, notwithstanding that the administration claimed and advised the President and his people that this was a special provision just for New York, there are instance after instance, in case after case after case, where other States received similar treatment, as they can and should have in order to push the tremendous cuts --15 percent-plus in some cases. There were going to be 25 percent cuts that hospitals dealing with a disproportionate share of this Nation's poor would otherwise have had to make. That is DSH payments. 
Let's understand what we are talking about. The average person--what are you talking about? What is this DSH? How do you take care, in large metropolitan areas in the North, the South, the East, and the West of our country, of those who do not have medical insurance? What do those hospitals do? Close their doors? Go bankrupt? Who is to pay for them? 
So there was a conscious effort by the committee to see to it that States with these disproportionate problems in terms of dealing with the uninsured, with those who had just Medicaid and Medicaid alone, who cannot sustain the operations of our medical centers, to give relief. Indeed, Mr. President, I believe if one were to add up the totality of the money provided, it would be in the area of $700 to $800 million that was given in relief to pushing the cuts that these States and these institutions would otherwise absorb. 
Let me give you just some of the States. Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont. 
Mr. President, to suggest that New York was the only one, indeed, New York could have been included. And if draftsmanship had been used, if we had known that we would have been singled out in this manner, I tell you we could have included the provision within the budget in such a way that all of these States including New York would have had to be vetoed then. 
Are we saying it is the poor of New York who should be disadvantaged? We don't begrudge help to those States that are needing it. This is not an attempt to game the system. And let me talk about that. 
There came a point in time when the Federal Government became aware that some States were gaming the system. In other words, certain States were guilty of scamming. That was wrong, and both Senator Moynihan and I provided the support, and it passed unanimously, that we put a stop to that. But let's understand that is not what New York was doing. 
For example, for those who were gaming the system, a provider would pay a $5,000 provider tax to the State. The State would then draw a matching $5,000 from the Federal Government and then reimburse the provider. It was a scam. It was simply a bookkeeping entry to get the Federal Government to pick up an expense that the State never really incurred and the provider did not incur. 
That is wrong. That is not our system. New York was not then and is not now involved in that scam. This wasn't an attempt to bill poor people for services and build roads or not use those moneys. That has never been the allegation. And, indeed, as a matter of fact, New York has had a long history of requiring insurers to pay assessments on hospital services. Thereby, that assessment over and above that particular service would go to help the poorest of the poor. And, indeed, we now have a program by utilizing these provider taxes that provides insurance for those families who could not purchase it for their youngsters. We provide up to 140,000 youngsters, children up to the age of 19, with insurance. It comes from this provider tax. 
Let me say that these assessments provide $1.1 billion a year in gross provider tax collections and are used for dealing with uninsured children, the poorest of the poor. The Balanced Budget Act contained language which specifically determined that New York provider taxes meet the legitimate requirements. That is what we did. 
Now, Mr. President, we have attempted for more than 2 years to get a resolve of this matter from HCFA. Nothing. Nothing. No response. Delay, delay, delay, delay. You can't do that to a community. You are not doing it just to a State government. That impacts on the lives of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people. Is that fair? 
And so, Mr. President, I find it incomprehensible and absolutely a tragedy that the President would have received this kind of advice. People, I believe, did not tell the President the entire story. I cannot believe that he really would want to veto a provision, the dollars of which are used to take care of the truly needy. I hope that between the time this legislation that we have introduced comes to a vote, we can get a resolve of this matter, not to deal with it in a confrontational, adversarial way, but in a way that makes sense, in a way that is fair, that is fair intellectually, that is fair morally, that is fair ethically. 
And I want to make it clear that I concede nothing. If we have to fight, why then we will, because this is a battle not about a State being treated fairly or unfairly but about its people and their needs. This is a battle that says that a State does have a right to raise revenues in a particular manner and to utilize them for the purpose which I have attempted to outline. 
I want to commend my colleague, who, as the ranking member of Finance and, indeed, the senior member on Budget, was there every moment of the negotiations, and never once were we told this is a special treatment.

Mr. DAMATO. Never once. And so for it to be sprung on us --I was out of the country--I said, when asked, that I was shocked, truly shocked. Again, I think the President is a big enough person to look at this in a way, or to say to those in charge at HCFA, come on, let's resolve this. Let's see to it that New York's problem, which is one of seeing to the needs of the uninsured--and, by the way, we have plans in speaking to the administration--and Senator Moynihan and I have been conferring with the health department people. They believe that this program can be and will be in the fullness of time--it is a program to provide insurance where families pay a very modest amount, in some cases $25 a month, and some none depending upon their income--that it can be expanded to take care of up to 500,000 young people, youngsters, children who otherwise would not be insured. 
Mr. President, we are not going to give up the battle. It is a battle that we are committed to winning on behalf of the poor, on behalf of the needy, on behalf of the uninsured, on behalf of the many working families that do not have full coverage. And I am proud and privileged to join the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, in an attempt to get justice for these children and for those in need. 
Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend the conferees for the provisions of this legislation that establish new preventive care benefits within the Medicare Program. There has been some criticism of these provisions by those who do not see the wisdom of adding new Medicare benefits at a time when we are cutting over $110 billion from the program. However, at a time when we are forced to reduce program spending, our goal should be to make the overall program as cost-effective as possible. These new preventive benefits, particularly colorectal cancer screening, are both medically wise and economically smart. I am proud to have the opportunity to be in the Senate at a time when we enact these new benefits into law. 
I am pleased that the conference report provides that the determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services [HHS] regarding the coverage of the barium examination as a colorectal cancer screening provision will be made by January 1, 1998 or within 90 days of enactment, whichever is earlier. Given the recent recommendations of the American Cancer Society and reports by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and other groups, I see no reason that HHS cannot meet this deadline. Medicare coverage of colorectal cancer screening takes effect on January 1, 1998. This deadline assures that the determination on Medicare coverage of the barium examination and other screening procedures will be made as the program goes into effect. 
I also note that the conference report incorporates language from the Senate provision directing the Secretary of HHS to consult with appropriate organizations in making the determination with regard to coverage of the barium examination and other new screening technology. The American Cancer Society is one of the organizations that HHS should consult with because that group, more than any other, represents the interests of cancer patients and their families. The new ACS guidelines, which I understand are based upon the results of a 2-year study by a panel of 16 experts on colorectal cancer, should be of great assistance to HHS in establishing the best possible colorectal cancer screening program for Medicare recipients. 
Mr. President, this budget agreement represents a major accomplishment for our Government, our economy, and our Nation as a whole. It also represents a major step forward for elderly Americans across this country. These new preventive benefits will help our senior citizens and save thousands of lives. I am glad to have had the opportunity to work on this legislation. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, 2 million college faculty participants--260,000 in my State of New York--rely on TIAA and CREF pensions to provide retirement security. Participants know when they choose CREF, every contribution dollar goes to the retirement annuity accumulations, or payout company, CREF offers no guarantees nor does it maintain contingency reserves. Yet CREF performs functions similar to a separate account of a life insurance company by allowing retirees to receive variable annuity payouts. 
I would like to join Senator Moynihan and ask Senator Roth, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, to comment on the intent of the bill concerning the taxation of CREF?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and distinguished colleague, Senator Moynihan, in introducing legislation that we believe will curb the devastating effects of acid rain in New York State and throughout the entire Nation. Our bill seeks to place controls on the emission of the pollutants that cause acid rain and acid deposition--Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx)--beyond those levels enacted in the 1990 Clean Air Act. In this way, we will ensure that those entities that are primarily responsible for the pollution that affects down-wind States such as New York are held to the same strict accountability. 
New Yorkers know all too well that pollution transported from up-wind sources has had a devastating impact on the Adirondacks as well as other regions within the State. The prevalence of acid deposition has reached the point where the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] estimates that without further controls of nitrogen oxides, the number of acidic lakes in the Adirondacks could increase to 43 percent by the year 2040. Such an increase will see approximately 1,300 lakes out of the 3,000 in the Adirondacks become chronically acidic. Clearly, we must take action to prevent this from becoming a reality. 
Under the 1990 Clean Air Act, a cap on SO2 emissions was enacted. It was designed to reduce the overall level of this pollutant by 50 percent by the year 2000. To provide an incentive to decrease emissions even more, a system of trading allowances for SO2 was established. An `allowance' allows a utility to emit 1 ton of SO2 pollution. These trading allowances enable utilities that have reached their allowable emission caps for SO2 to buy another utility's excess capability. This ability to `trade' tons of SO2 has been popular with utilities and has actually brought significant reductions in the amount of SO2 emitted in a cost-effective manner. The legislation that we are introducing today builds on that success by instituting a NOx cap and trade program that we believe will have a positive impact on the environment. 
Under the bill, the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] would be required to allocate a capped number of NOx emission allowances nationwide--excluding Alaska and Hawaii. The EPA would base each State's allotment on the percentage share of power each State generates within the 48 contiguous States. So, if a particular State generates 5 percent of the power in the Continental United States, then that State would be entitled to 5 percent of the total emissions pool. 
Once a State had received its emission allowances, the State would be able to divide those allowances within the State in any manner it chooses. Utilities would be required to ensure that they have enough tons at their disposal to cover their total emission tonnage. If a State had additional tons, they would be able to sell allowances or `bank' them for use at a future time. A utility without enough allowances would have to buy them on the open market, an option currently in practice with SO2. Utilities that do not abide by these restrictions on capping and trading NOx allowances would be fined $6,000 per ton emitted over the established limit for that plant. States that are unwilling or unable to determine the allocation of allowances to utilities within their State would have that capability default to the EPA. 
The NOx trading program would go into effect in the year 2000 with an annual cap of 5.4 million allowances nationwide decreasing to 3 million allowances in 2003. Currently, utilities emit approximately 6.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx). 
The bill would also create further protections against harmful pollution during the summer months when ozone levels are at their highest. When NOx combines with heat, sunlight and volatile organic compounds [VOC's], the end product is ozone. Thus, ideal conditions for high levels of ground-level ozone occur mainly in the summer months. To combat this, the legislation calls for utilities to give up two allowances for each ton of NOx emitted during the months of May, June, July, August and September instead of the one allowance per ton that would apply for the remaining 7 months of the year. This would effectively drop the total emission of NOx to 2.3 million tons after the year 2003 and would create approximately a 70 percent reduction in NOx emissions from the 1990 level. 
In addition, the bill calls for further reductions in SO2 in the year 2003, when utilities will be required to use two allowances per ton of SO2 emitted instead of one. This would cut these emissions in half. The bill also requires the EPA to conduct a study on the effects that mercury, a toxic metal, may have on the environment and how to measure this mercury with an eye towards possible monitoring and control of mercury emissions in the future. 
Finally, the bill contains a provision for specific research on the effect of acid deposition on the sensitive ecosystems of the Adirondacks, the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains, the Mid-Appalachian Mountains and water bodies of the Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, Long Island Sound and the Chesapeake Bay. If proven by research that a particular region is still threatened, then the Administrator may take further steps to promote environmental recovery of that region. 
We in New York continue to see the effects that acid rain and acid deposition have on our environment. Lakes, streams and trees in the Adirondacks are still dying due to the continued emission and transport of these pollutants. Other states and other regions throughout our nation have similar problems. If we are to pass along a healthy environment to our children and grandchildren, we must be willing to enact the controls that will preserve that legacy. The legislation that Senator Moynihan and I have proposed is strong medicine, but it will enable us to sustain our heritage for generations to come.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the Senate has accepted an amendment that Senator Moynihan and I offered to the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill that I believe will help provide a measure of financial relief to the working men and women of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties. Residents of these counties pay a premium price to commute each day into New York City by commuter railroad. Roughly half of these commuters then have to pay another fare to get to their final destination by bus or subway. Our amendment will require the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA] to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of providing a free subway or bus transfer to those persons who use the Long Island Rail Road [LIRR] or Metro North commuter railroad so that these daily riders may decrease their commuting costs. 
Recently, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA] announced its MetroCard Gold program. This program for the first time provides free transfers for those who transfer between New York City buses and subways. In essence, the commuter who until now commuted from a two-fare zone now pays only one fare. This program will greatly benefit city commuters, saving them approximately $750 per year. It will also have a positive impact on the local economy and the environment. 
In addition, at my urging, the MTA will extend this single fare policy for similar bus-to-bus and bus-to-subway transfers for the MTA's 40,000 Long Island Bus commuters traveling between Long Island and New York City. It is estimated that these commuters will realize an average yearly savings of approximately $900 based on current fare structures. 
The intended goal of this policy is to create a seamless, integrated transportation system that will benefit commuters in the most transit-dependent region of our country and, indeed, the world. I commend Governor George Pataki and MTA Chairman Virgil Conway for this forward thinking initiative. What now needs to be determined is if this policy can be expanded. My amendment will require the Metropolitan Transportation Authority [MTA] to conduct a feasibility study, from funds made available to the MTA from the Federal Transit Administration, on extending this policy to New York's two commuter railroads. 
New York is home to the two largest commuter railroads in the Nation--the Long Island Rail Road [LIRR] and the Metro North railroad. Each day, approximately 235,000 commuters depend on these two railroads to get to work and back home again. Almost half of these commuters--108,000 or 46 percent--transfer to subways and buses once they arrive in New York City. They also repeat the trip in the evening as they head back to the train station. These are commuters who may pay $125, $175, $225 or more per month to take these two commuter railroads. On top of that, they can pay an additional $750 over the course of a year for that portion of their commute that occurs on the city's subways and buses. 
If we really want to create a seamless transit system, one that encourages more people to take the train and leave their cars at home, then Metro North and Long Island Rail Road commuters should be offered a free transfer to the City's subways and buses. In addition to the financial savings for commuters, the benefits to public health, the environment and the preservation of natural resources as well as the enhancements to the quality of life for these commuters should be powerful incentives to extend this single-fare policy. 
More than 100,000 Long Island Rail Road and Metro North rail commuters use New York's subway and bus systems daily. If it is feasible--and taking into consideration all factors--then the commuters who use Long Island Rail Road [LIRR] or Metro North and the New York City subway or bus systems should receive similar benefits as are available under the MTA's single-fare policy. This amendment will move us one step closer to that goal.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I join my friend and colleague from the Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, to offer a bill that would authorize a congressional gold medal in recognition of the tremendous leadership role--in interfaith relations, international affairs, the promotion of global environmental protection, and the defense of human rights worldwide--of his all holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. 
In addition, we are submitting a concurrent resolution providing for the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for a ceremony honoring Patriarch Bartholomew on his visit to the United States in late October of this year. 
The Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is the 270th successor of the nearly 2,000 year old Orthodox Christian Church founded in 36 A.D. 
As the spiritual leader of the Orthodox Christian Church, Patriarch Bartholomew is the voice for nearly 300 million followers around the world--5 million of which live in the United States and are of Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbian descent. The contributions of these Americans to our history and culture exemplify the values, ideals, and dreams of this great Nation. 
A champion of religious unity and cooperation, Patriarch Bartholomew is working to promote interfaith dialog between the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, leading Protestant denominations, Muslim leaders, and various faiths of America's multiethnic diversity. 
Patriarch Bartholomew has also sought to strengthen the bonds between Judaism and Orthodox Christianity. In 1994, he worked side by side with Rabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation to cosponsor the Peace and Tolerance Conference, bringing together Christians, Jews, and Muslims for human and religious freedom. 
As a citizen of Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew is deeply concerned about the need to sustain the cause of peace. He has been a dynamic leader in efforts to ease Greek-Turkish tensions and to promote international cooperation, adherence to international law, and respect for the human rights of victims of aggression. 
The impact of Patriarch Bartholomew's compassion is far-reaching. In the war-torn countries of the Balkans, Patriarch Bartholomew has helped to advance reconciliation among Catholic, Muslim, and Orthodox communities. 
Mr. President, Patriarch Bartholomew also cares very deeply for the environmental legacy we will one day leave to our children. Together with global leaders, he convened an international environmental symposium emphasizing the health and well-being of the world's oceans. The Patriarch is also a cosponsor of an annual conference addressing the protection of our global environment. 
Born in Turkey in 1940, Patriarch Bartholomew has selflessly dedicated his life to religious service. He is a graduate of the renowned Theological School of Halki, which was forced to close by the Turkish Government in 1971. This school must re-open as a basic matter of religious freedom. 
Patriarch Bartholomew has also received numerous honorary doctorates and academic honors from institutes and universities all across the globe. 
Mr. President, in October of this year, Patriarch Bartholomew will visit the United States to offer his spiritual message of unity, compassion, and brotherhood. It is our belief that Congress honor the work of this great leader in recognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions to: the freedom of the world's religions, world peace, conflict resolution and the rule of law, global environmental protection, the betterment of humankind, and the protection of dignity and human rights of every man, woman, and child. 
Therefore, Mr. President, it is fitting and appropriate that this body bestow the congressional gold medal upon a visionary for our times, his all holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, one year ago today, our friend and former colleague in the other body, Hamilton Fish, died here in Washington. 
Ham and his forebears, statesman and patriots to a man, were gifts to our Nation's Capital from New York where they emerged from immigrant roots that were truly extraordinary in the American experience. 
In the years I knew Ham, I saw reflected in his bearing, his code of life, his approach to the law and devotion to public service, a man whose very genes held rich lessons of bravery, honesty, integrity and patriotism handed down from those who had formed this Nation, nurtured and served it since the 17th Century. And yet he never let on about the first Mayor of New York, the last Mayor of Brooklyn, a hero of the Battle of Yorktown who looks down from the nearby Rotunda's wall, the Secretary of State, the Senators, Rough Riders and Members of the House of Representatives who filled his family tree. 
An impressive lineage was not what was important to him. To Ham, what one did in the time allotted by God was what mattered. 
Officially, Hamilton Fish, was the 13-term Congressman from the Empire State's Hudson Valley, who from his earliest years in Congress wrestled with the turmoil of Watergate and the Vietnam war, the causes of civil rights, refugees, the environment, and a daily concern that Washington respond to and be a positive influence for his constituents and all Americans. 
He was neither a `hawk' nor a `dove' in the contentious and important issues of his time, but rather an impressive `owl'--a wise owl, using head and heart, with the talons to fight a ferocious battle when needed, but possessing the sharp ears and keen eyes to recognize and counsel for the strength to be gained from collegial compromise; knowing the ways to bridge often great divides of politics and ideologies. 
Ham Fish was also a very private figure in our midst. The deep love he shared with his wife and family was obvious soon after first meeting him; but the little known, almost spiritual way he approached, planned and prepared for each and every one of his days until he died, whether for legislating, trout fishing or making a favorite soup recipe, being with his grandchildren near his beloved Hudson River or meeting with the famous or not so famous, was astonishing. Hamilton Fish the private man knew each and every day was to be cherished: taken all in all, of limited number and deserving to be filled with actions and thoughts that were positive, moral and strong. 
His memory will remain strong for all of us that worked with him. I hope those who are just beginning their lives of public service will take a moment today to think about Hamilton Fish of New York . . . a genuine gift to our nation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment relating to Department of Agriculture rural housing programs. I would like to express my appreciation to Chairman Cochran and Ranking Minority Member Bumpers for their consideration of this amendment and their continued commitment to providing affordable housing for our Nation's rural Americans. 
The Department of Agriculture has a number of successful housing programs under the auspices of its Rural Housing Service [RHS]. Although operated by the Department of Agriculture, rural housing programs are under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I respectfully request the consideration of this much needed amendment. 
This amendment contains provisions which will permit important housing programs to continue in an uninterrupted and cost-efficient fashion. It includes 1-year extensions of housing programs which have expired or will expire in the near future. Specifically, the RHS Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, the RHS Section 538 Rural Rental Housing Loan Guarantee Program, and the RHS Underserved Areas Program would be extended until September 30, 1998. 
Due to the uncertainty of final passage of housing reauthorization legislation this year, these short-term extensions are essential. In addition, the amendment would alter the section 515 loan term and amortization schedule. This provision would change the loan term from 50 to 30 years, but allow the borrower to have the loan amortized for a period not to exceed 50 years. This statutory change incurs no cost to the American taxpayer, and is necessary to ensure that budget authority provided will support the administration's proposed fiscal year 1998 section 515 program level. 
The need for affordable housing in rural areas is severe. According to the 1990 census, over 2.7 million rural Americans live in substandard housing. In my home State of New York, 76 percent of renters are paying 30 percent or more of their income for housing. Approximately 60 percent of New York renters pay over 50 percent of their income for rent. 
The section 515 and section 538 programs are some of the few resources available to respond to this serious unmet housing need. Since its inception in 1962, the section 515 rental loan program has financed the development of over 450,000 units of affordable units in over 18,000 apartment projects. The program assists elderly, disabled, and low-income rural families with an average income of $7,200. The alteration of the section 515 loan term and amortization schedule will provide over 500 additional units. The section 538 program is a relatively young loan guarantee program which has already proven to have widespread national appeal. With a proposed subsidy rate of approximately 3 cents per $1, it is an example of cost-effective leveraging of public resources. 
I thank the Appropriations Committee for its recognition of the great need for these important rural housing programs and its steadfast commitment to ensuring that every Federal dollar appropriated serves the greatest number of our low-income rural Americans. I support immediate passage of this amendment. Thank you.

Mr. DAMATO. I appreciate all that the chairman has done to accommodate the specific needs of military installations in New York. As you know, New York has been devastated by its losses from the last two BRAC rounds. However, the one positive effect of this paring down is that the remaining bases in New York are among the most efficient and effective in the world. That is why these military construction dollars are so important to New York State. 
One military base of particular concern to both Senator Moynihan and myself is Fort Drum in Watertown, NY. Fort Drum is home to the 10th Mountain Division. The mission of the 10th Mountain Division is to deploy rapidly anywhere in the world and be prepared to fight and win upon arrival. 
The 10th Mountain Division stands ready to depart Fort Drum and conduct operations anywhere in the world with minimal notice. The cornerstone to Fort Drum's preparedness is its high state of mission readiness. This readiness is sustained through intensive training and the most up-to-date, modern facilities. 
America continually asks our soldiers around the world to respond and they are always there for us. The 10th Mountain Division is the most frequently deployed division in the Army. It is only fair that Congress appropriate the necessary dollars to ensure that our troops remain the best in the world. 
Fort Drum has requested two very important projects that would greatly enhance readiness on the base and contribute to the 10th Mountain Division's extremely high response time. The first is an aerial gunnery range, funded at $17.5 million in the House. The proposed range will be an adequately sized and properly configured aerial gunnery range for Army rotary wing and Air National Guard fixed wing joint mission requirements. The facility and range area will enable the Air National Guard and Fort Drum range division to employ operations under the joint air attack team concept [JAAT] as well as consolidate existing operations to the northeast side of Fort Drum property for safe operations. Currently, rotary wing and fixed wing operations are conducted on separate sites across the Fort Drum installation. 
The second project is a military training and education center, funded at $6.9 million, to replace a number of widely scattered temporary 50-year old, inefficient and marginal World War II wood facilities. 
The center would make a valuable contribution to improving quality of life for soldiers, dependents and civilians at Fort Drum. Without the center, the condition of aging facilities will become less able to support the function and eventually continuing education opportunities for the population of Fort Drum will be negatively impacted. Last year, the Senate included this project in its version of the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill. 
I would hope that the House--Senate Conference Committee would include both of these important projects in the final conference report for fiscal year 1998.

Mr. DAMATO. First, I thank Chairman Bond and the ranking minority member, Senator Mikulski, for their tremendous leadership in developing this appropriations bill. I fully recognize the fiscal restraints under which the subcommittee must work to achieve our budgetary goals, and I commend them for effectively weighing our national priorities with those constraints. 
I file this amendment on behalf of my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, Senator Lautenberg, and Senator Torricelli, because we have in the New York-New Jersey region a very difficult pressing problem. 
I rise today on behalf of New York's 1.7 million veterans, in particular, to address the expected loss of $180 million in veterans' health care funding over the next 3 years. What this amendment does is seek to ensure that the funding reallocation for the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation System, known as VERA, is distributed in a fair and reasonable manner. I want to respond to specific concerns with the data used by the VA to determine the allocation of health care resources to our Nation's veterans. 
This amendment would require the General Accounting Office to conduct a 4-month study, examining the factors relied upon by VERA and the Veterans Integrated Service Network to distribute health care funds. 
The study will focus on the following characteristics which are significant to New York, New Jersey, and to our veterans in the Northeast: First, the high number of special needs veterans residing in the Northeast States; second, the impact of eligibility reform on veterans; and third, the quality and accessibility of health care in the northeast region. 
In addition, the amendment would direct the Veterans Administration to fund all VISN's at their fiscal year 1996 level until the GAO study is received by the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee. 
Mr. President, it is absolutely crucial for our veterans in New York that the factors I have just listed be considered by the VA as the VERA system continues to be implemented. 
It is imperative that the results of any GAO assessment of this VERA system being incorporated as soon as it is practicable because, without such consideration, the New York VA medical system could continue to suffer grievously. The effects of such a substantial funding cut--$180 million over 3 years--are something that we are very concerned about. For instance, a loss of VA services seems likely to have resulted in reduced levels of care. Two of New York's VA facilities, Montrose and Castlepoint, as well as others throughout the region, have suffered repeatedly. There are examples of poor care due to their ongoing merger under this system. Montrose and Castlepoint, two of the hospitals located in the Hudson Valley, have experienced skyrocketing mortality rates in both institutions. In addition, extremely poor health care and neglectful sanitary conditions have also been reported at both facilities, including: misdiagnosed infections and heart attacks; moldy suction tubes; patients lying for hours at a time in their own waste; and, in one report, a man dying for lack of a doctor as physicians conduct a meeting without their beepers. 
Question: Is this as a result of a lack of proper care? We have to find out the truth and be sure that the massive restructuring and relocation of resources is done fairly but safely. 
Mr. President, we are extremely concerned with concerned the effects of the VERA system on veterans health care in our Northeastern States. That is why I offer this amendment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond for his response. I thank him on behalf of the veterans of New York, New Jersey and, indeed, the whole Northeast region. I think we are appreciative of his efforts, and he recognizes the importance of these concerns. 
In particular, I am appreciative of the Senator's willingness to join me in ensuring that the GAO conducts a study which will specifically focus on the impact to the Northeast region. 
I understand that the Senator will join me in urging the Veterans' Administration to adopt GAO recommendations into its VERA system immediately. And because of the Senator's willingness to ensure that the New York and New Jersey VA health care needs are recognized and that the reallocation system will be fair and equitable, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, I will withdraw this amendment at this time. I thank the Senator, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on our veterans needs. 
So, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment, and I thank my colleague, Senator Bond. I look forward to working with him, and I thank him for his responsiveness to this need.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my friend, Senator Kit Bond and his efforts to include funding for important community development programs within the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1998. In particular, I would like to highlight the provision of $12 million for the Community Outreach Partnerships Centers [COPC] program. I commend the subcommittee for its diligence in funding this program at this level. 
The COPC program provides assistance to public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education for a wide range of community outreach activities. These colleges and universities may utilize COPC funds to address a variety of local needs, including housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization, job training, and crime prevention. The program thus utilizes and leverages the enormous resources of our institutions of higher learning to establish partnerships with local neighborhoods and communities to solve their common problems. 
Mr. President, I would like to applaud the outstanding community outreach efforts of Long Island University [LIU] located in my home State of New York and bring these efforts to the attention of the Subcommittee on VA-HUD Appropriations. Long Island University, founded in 1886, has a current enrollment of 24,000 students and conducts a variety of community oriented programs at each of its six New York campuses. 
LIU's various community outreach programs at its Brooklyn campus are particularly successful and well suited to the COPC program. For instance, the university operates a number of educational programs for senior citizens and New York City school students, including underprivileged and minority students. In addition, the university operates a small business development institute, a speech and pathology clinic which serves needy persons with disabilities free of charge, and a collaborative career development and cooperative education initiative. 
Mr. President, Long Island University has an outstanding track record of community involvement. It has formed successful partnerships with state and local governments, including the New York City Board of Education, as well as community and business groups. It has successfully leveraged additional funding from a wide variety of sources. I believe that its activities are a successful example of positive and constructive change within the community. 
I thank Senator Bond for his efforts and I commend the community outreach activities of Long Island University as a model for funding under the COPC program.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to state my strong support for the VA-HUD Subcommittee's efforts to support funding in this legislation to combat the twin scourges of drugs and crime in low-income housing throughout the Nation. I am greatly encouraged by the subcommittee's action in maintaining $290 million in funding for the Drug Elimination Grant Program. 
Under this important program, the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] makes funds available to local housing authorities for the purpose of combating and preventing crime, including drug-related crime. Housing authorities have great flexibility in determining how best to use these funds to address local needs. Many authorities have used drug elimination funding to create and expand community policing efforts, to make capital improvements to improve security, to fund drug awareness, prevention, and treatment programs and to organize tenant patrols and neighborhood watch programs. 
I am also fully aware of the subcommittee's inclusion of $30 million for the New Approach antidrug program and I strongly support this provision. This funding will be available to help combat drugs and crime in non-federally assisted low-income housing which is too often overlooked in the traditional public housing programs. 
However, I would like to state my concern with one aspect of the structure of the account which provides funding for the Drug Elimination Program. This troubling aspect is the expansion of a set-aside for the Operation Safe Home initiative, administered by the HUD Office of Inspector General, within that account. Let me be clear, I do not question the effectiveness or usefulness of the Operation Safe Home initiative. This initiative has had gratifying success in confiscating guns and drugs from public housing. 
However, I am concerned with the source of funding for this initiative. By reducing the amount of funding available for drug elimination grants, we are effectively cutting into local efforts to combat crime and drugs. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, the committee with authorizing jurisdiction over the multitude of HUD programs, I was pleased to cosponsor S. 462, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This legislation, which was passed out of the Banking Committee on May 8, 1997 by a unanimous 18-0 vote, contains an important provision which would allow funding for the Operation Safe Home initiative to be provided from the HUD headquarters' reserve fund. I am convinced that this is a far more appropriate funding vehicle for this initiative. 
Like many other important HUD programs, such as public housing operating assistance and housing for the elderly and disabled, the administration requested a cut in the Drug Elimination Grant Program. This proposed $20 million cut would occur as a result of a set-aside within the program to fund the HUD inspector general's Operation Safe Home initiative. 
Mr. President, I am grateful that the VA-HUD Subcommittee did not follow the approach adopted in the House, and instead reduced the administration's recommended cut of $20 million to a $15 million cut. However, I believe that even this reduced cut in antidrug funding is too much and the full amount should be restored to the program. 
I express my wish to continue to work with the VA-HUD Subcommittee as we move toward conference with the House of Representatives on this important legislation. I am confident that attempts to increase this set-aside at conference will be unsuccessful and I am hopeful that together the Banking and Appropriations Committees can agree upon a more appropriate source of funding for the Operation Safe Home initiative. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again thank my good friend Senator Bond for his leadership and diligence in crafting a VA-HUD appropriations bill which makes tough choices with the limited amount of funds available. I look forward to working together as the process continues.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Kit Bond for his efforts to provide funding within the VA-HUD Appropriations bill to expand homeownership activities through the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. In this regard, I note with particular appreciation the provision of $30 million in funding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and Affordable Housing program. 
This program was expanded and reauthorized by the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act [HOPE Act], which I was pleased to sponsor. It provides an unparalleled opportunity to support local housing and homeownership initiatives. Specifically, the HOPE Act provided for the support of housing organizations which utilize a self-help approach to homeownership opportunities. 
Mr. President, I would like to commend and bring to the attention of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee the outstanding efforts of one particular self-help housing provider located in my home state of New York. The Riverhead Revitalization and Preservation Corp. [Riverhead Corp.], under the guidance and leadership of Ms. Patricia Stark, utilizes donated labor from volunteers and potential homeowners to develop and rehabilitate homes on Long Island, NY. 
The Riverhead Corp. is helping to reverse the decline of neighborhoods by renovating blighted homes and providing a stake in the community for first-time homeowners. In addition, the Riverhead Corp. employs a revolving loan-fund strategy which reinvests proceeds from home sales in the further development of housing opportunities. Thus, the Riverhead Corp. helps to stimulate community revitalization, promotes job and business creation, and provides housing for deserving low- and moderate-income working families. 
I commend the efforts of the Riverhead Corp. to the Subcommittee and to HUD as a model of success which would be worthy of support under the self-help homeownership auspices of the Capacity Building program funded by this legislation. Once again, I would like to thank Senator Kit Bond for his efforts to support increased homeownership throughout the Nation.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bond and Ranking Minority Member Mikulski for their steadfast recognition of the need to preserve our Nation's dwindling supply of affordable rental housing units. The Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [LIHPRHA] is an important tool for maintaining this scarce resource. I appreciate your bill's provision of a structure for continuing a modified capital grant-capital loan program for housing preservation activities under the existing LIHPRHA program. 
As you are aware, there are almost 30,000 low-income rental units in 37 States that have been approved by HUD and are awaiting funding through this program. This represents a critical need for preservation of the existing stock, particularly in tight rental markets. In low vacancy rate areas, tenant-based rental assistance is often ineffective in meeting the housing needs of deserving low-income Americans. In New York City, for example, housing development and land acquisition costs are high and production of new affordable housing is very limited. Therefore, retaining the current housing stock is a cost-efficient and desirable means of meeting shelter needs.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend my friend, Senator Kit Bond for his efforts as chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee to include $35 million in funding for the Youthbuild program. This innovative and successful program allows disadvantaged and at-risk youth to acquire educational and job skills and develop leadership abilities within their communities. In the process, the program helps to develop and rehabilitate physically distressed housing in order to provide decent, safe and affordable housing opportunities to low and moderate-income families. 
I also note that the subcommittee has instructed HUD to provide a priority in funding for program applicants that demonstrate an ability to leverage private and nonprofit funding. In this era of limited Federal funding, it is essential that our program dollars are stretched to the maximum extent possible. I fully support this important provision and believe it will result in a greater benefit for each Federal dollar provided and a greater amount of local community coordination and decisionmaking. 
I would like to bring one particular organization to the attention of the chairman and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski. The Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp. [Restoration] located in central Brooklyn has a 30-year legacy of economic development, job creation, and community building. Restoration currently operates an education and job training initiative, known as Career Path, which assists economically disadvantaged young adults, ages 16-24, to become productive members of the community by providing education and developing employment, citizenship, and leadership skills. 
I note that the Restoration Corp. has an outstanding record of successfully leveraging local, State, and private funding through private charities, foundation support, corporate sponsorship, and a variety of private fundraising efforts. One such effort recently resulted in Restoration receiving a 5 year $1.75 million grant from Cablevision, Inc. I believe Restoration's Career Path initiative represents a successful model which leverages private funding, invests in our youth and helps to revitalize the stock of affordable housing. 
By helping to fund Restoration's Career Path initiative, HUD can help to restore economic viability to the neighborhoods of central Brooklyn and assist at-risk young adults to become active and productive members of the community. Once again, I would express my appreciation and support for Senator Bond's continuing efforts to support successful housing and economic development initiatives.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Grassley in the introduction of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Good Samaritan Act. This bill is essential to protect trained federal law enforcement officers who want to offer assistance when they witness a crime but are afraid of the repercussions afterwards if it is not a crime defined under their agency's authorizing statute. 
Agents in the federal law enforcement community are charged with the investigation of criminal activities defined in their authorizing statute. For example, DEA agents investigate drug crimes and a Secret Service agent's role is limited to financial crimes. If acting `within the scope of their employment', meaning they deal with only those crimes listed in their agency's authorizing statute, the actions of the Special Agent will not result in personal liability. In addition, the employing agency may assign counsel or provide worker's compensation if the Special Agent was injured in the line of duty. 
However, when an off-duty Federal Agent witnesses the commission of a violent crime, such as a DEA agent witnessing a robbery, the intervention is deemed to be outside the scope of his or her employment. Unfortunately, that special agent's intervention may subject the off-duty Federal Law Enforcement Agent to personal liability--without the protections afforded them if they were on duty. 
There are few cases nation-wide but it has affected the intervention of our Federal Law Enforcement Officers. In one instance, two DEA agents on a surveillance saw a parked car occupied by a man and a young woman. The car was not part of the surveillance. This did not stop the agents from intervening when they saw the young woman struggling with the man and screaming for help. Their assistance was not `within the scope of their employment' but these trained agents wanted to help, using their expertise in crisis situations. The DEA agents certainly were not thinking a lawsuit when they intervened but because their actions were outside the scope, they were acting as private citizens--subjecting their personal assets to a lawsuit. 
Federal agents who unexpectedly encounter violence in our communities face an unconscionable choice: 1.) stand by and allow the violence to occur; 2.) refuse help to the victim and allow the perpetrator to escape; or 3.) intervene as a private citizen and risk bankruptcy by a potential lawsuit. 
Currently, there exists no federal statute authorizing Federal Special Agents to intervene during the commission of certain violent crimes outside the scope of their statutory authority, and protecting their personal assets when they assist someone in need. I urge my colleagues to review the merits of this bill and join in this effort to relieve the fear of our specially trained law enforcement agent and possibly encouraging their intervention when citizens need it the most. 
This bill explicitly defines when a specially trained agent may be protected if he or she offers assistance `outside the scope of their employment'. These instances are limited to:

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment along with Senator Helms and Senator Faircloth. 
My amendment would provide that none of the funds appropriated for the new arrangements to borrow [NAB] by the International Monetary Fund could be made available until the relevant authorizing committees have reviewed these provisions and authorizing legislation has been enacted. 
The Clinton administration and the International Monetary Fund have asked Congress to give the IMF $3.5 billion of the taxpayer's money to support the new arrangements to borrow. The NAB is an arrangement where 25 participating countries agree to lend funds to the IMF, in predetermined amounts, whenever the organization believes those funds are needed to forestall or cope with an impairment of the international monetary or to deal with an exceptional situation that poses a threat to the stability of that system. 
This appropriations bill supports this request by including $3.5 billion for the NAB. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the authorizing committees have not had an opportunity to review these new arrangements to borrow. We need to have hearings and fully review these provisions, which have significant consequences for the American taxpayer. 
We simply can't give an international bureaucracy such as the IMF a blank check without a thorough review by the relevant congressional committees. My amendment would simply do this--give us the opportunity to fully examine this proposal.

Mr. President, I thank the chairman and my good friend, Senator Domenici, and Senator Reid for giving me this opportunity to address what I consider to be the acts of a courageous individual and the fact that the House today acted in a bipartisan manner, unanimously passing S. 768, a bill to give to Christopher Meili the opportunity to live in this country, and to say once again that America understands the courage exhibited by Christopher Meili in his extraordinary action in reporting and making public the destruction of documents in Switzerland at great peril to himself and to his family. He was ostracized for this act. He was threatened with death. His family, his two children, can no longer live in their own country. Once again, America has opened its heart and its doors. 
The House, in an extraordinary act, has given him the opportunity to live here, to work here, to raise his family. Christopher Meili is a noble man whose actions ennobled all of us, and he has suffered greatly for his courage in exposing the truth. Now he simply desires to live in freedom here in America with his family, and now he can. 
I spoke to Christopher earlier today and told him that the House of Representatives had completed action and that it had passed the legislation, and now it awaits the President's signature. I am certain that the President will continue the process of making possible Christopher's staying here in this country and giving to him the freedom that he yearns for himself and his family. 
Mr. President, I commend those of my colleagues who, by way of their action in passing this legislation, have given Christopher an opportunity to live here in this country, and we once again demonstrate that we understand the extraordinary sacrifices that this young man made in the cause of freedom.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to cointroduce legislation with Senator Moynihan that would greatly assist economic development in Syracuse, NY. This legislation concerns Hancock Field in Syracuse. There are two parcels of land there that the Air Force Base Conversion Agency intends to dispose of, and would be of great value to the Hancock Field Development Corp. In this amendment, we ask that these parcels of land be conveyed to the corporation so that they may use the land to further economic development in the region and increase jobs. 
The first parcel of land was formerly the base housing management area. It is at a strategic spot on Performance Drive because it is needed to complete a major access way to the industrial airpark. The second parcel is 15 acres at the center of the airpark which is currently the site of the 152d Air Control Group, which is moving to a new location very soon. This parcel is owned by the Federal Government and will be declared surplus and disposed of through the traditional GSA property disposal process, rather than the BRAC disposal process. 
These small actions will have a big effect on the redevelopment at Hancock. I am very pleased that this amendment has been agreed to. I would also like to thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin, the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee. Their leadership in getting this important legislation passed was very instrumental.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me first say there are very few colleagues for whom I have greater respect and who are more knowledgeable in the areas of national security than the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. Indeed, he raises a very valid and natural concern that we have with respect to nuclear proliferation and the ability to enhance systems by way of the computer, the supercomputer in particular, and the need for proper balance in terms of export controls. That has been something which the Banking Committee has had jurisdiction over and has grappled with over the years. So, while I am sympathetic to the concerns that are raised, I just have to think that the issues of computer sales to foreign countries, as Senator Cochran has made clear to the Senate, is one that is so important that it really deserves much more analysis and much more debate than can be allowed for this floor amendment. 
Indeed, as the chairman of the Banking Committee's International Finance Subcommittee, I believe that Senator Grams has offered an amendment that is worthy of our support, because what it would do, it would allow the entire Senate to ascertain, by way of the kind of comprehensive analysis that we need by the General Accounting Office as it relates to what security needs may be open at the present time, what concerns are related to the sales of the high MTOPS computers to Tier 3 countries and what impact they may or may not have on this legislation that has been proposed. 
I think Senator Grams' amendment is the proper way to proceed, to give us an opportunity, not to just dive in after 45 minutes or 1 hour's worth of debate. We need the careful scrutiny, the careful study, to ascertain is there an availability of these computers to such an extent that this really becomes a meaningless impediment to our own trade? Will there be other countries in Europe and other areas that will rush to fill the vacuum? That is what I have been told. That may not be correct, but let's ascertain, let's find out. That is what Senator Grams' second-degree amendment would accomplish. 
It seems to me that makes sense. It would require the Commerce Committee to publish a list of questionable military and nuclear end users, with certain exceptions when sources and methods would be jeopardized. That is what we have to know. 
Let me depart just for a moment, if I might. If we want to do something as it relates to nuclear proliferation, let's say to some of those countries who are looking to get most-favored-nation trading status, or continue it, that you cannot be exporting--when we know they are exporting--the kind of missile systems and delivery systems which China is today exporting. 
That becomes something of a controversy. Let's find out how many of my colleagues are going to be willing to stand up to the business interests who look the other way and don't look at our national security interests or don't look at the abuse of human rights and the crackdown on religious freedoms that take place now or the forced sterilization of people. That is what is going on in China. They present, Mr. President, a very real and clear and present danger to the security of the world and to world peace by exporting to Iran and to other countries delivery systems and all kinds of enhancement of weapons systems which will endanger world peace. 
If we really want to do something, let's take that up, but to simply come forward at this point in time without the proper kind of analysis--again, Senator Grams should be commended because his second-degree amendment would say, `OK, let's make a detailed analysis,' and not come down on the floor and raise this. I think this is what we have to do. 
So not only on a jurisdictional basis would I have problems supporting the Cochran amendment, but basically on the basis of fact. I don't think we should just raise jurisdiction and say, `That's within my committee, and, therefore, I want it to come through my committee.' I sometimes get upset about that. If it is good legislation, so what if it didn't come through the committee process properly, particularly when we are talking about matters of national security. So I don't just raise that, but it does need the kind of careful thought, careful analysis that Senator Grams' amendment calls for. 
For that reason, I hope that we support overwhelmingly this cautious approach to making analysis of whether or not the export of the MTOPS to Tier 3 countries should go through 
another process with Government bureaucrats analyzing and never coming to a decision. I think that would be a mistake. 
Again, let's take a look at China: $50 billion surplus in trade, and yet she does what she wants, and she claims she wants friendship with us. I think on the altar of the almighty dollar, we just continue business as usual. I am more concerned about saying to them, `You can't be our friend on one hand, you can't be enjoying a $50 billion trade surplus with us and then have a half a billion dollar industry that your generals are running,' and we say, `Oh, no, don't rock the boat.' 
Do we really want to stop nuclear proliferation? Do we want to stop the export of deadly weapons systems? Let's do it when we have some clout, and we do have some clout. But I am afraid we will succumb to those who say, `Oh, we can't do this, we'll lose a lot of jobs here in this country if we stand up to that kind of activity.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today, I am proud to sponsor a bill which attacks drug traffickers by making it harder for these criminals to profit from their illegal windfalls. We have long known of the terrible price our communities pay because of drug abuse; the dashed hopes and dreams and the shattered lives of millions of Americans. The Congress, and the Administration, have a responsibility to do everything we can to restore those dreams and rebuild these communities. 
Drug kingpins and cartels are destroying our neighborhoods and poisoning our children. Unless we put an immediate stop to this criminal behavior, drug lords will continue to penetrate our schools and families. 
Mr. President, through money laundering, drug traffickers are able to take their blood money and launder it clean. These ill-gotten gains are then filtered throughout our economy. Money laundering sustains drug and arms dealers, as well as terrorists and other criminals searching for a way to prolong their illegal enterprises. Tax evasions, and trade and insurance fraud are the related byproducts of money laundering. 
Money laundering robs our Nation's financial institutions of their most valuable asset--their integrity. By abusing the Nation's financial institutions, the launderers increase their wealth and power often by purchasing land and buildings with these illicit funds. So it soon becomes impossible to distinguish drug money from wealth earned by hard working taxpayers. 
Day in, day out, the drug lords relentlessly peddle their products of death and misery for huge profits. While our police are hampered by their inability to effectively target large cash transactions. This bill sends the message that `enough is enough.' It hands our law enforcement agencies the tools to hit the criminals where it hurts--in the pocketbook. 
Mr. President, the bill has three major provisions: 
First, It requires the Treasury Secretary to create a national money laundering strategy and report to Congress. 
Second, It allows the Secretary to designate `high risk zones" where money laundering is concentrated. 
Third, The high risk zones will be eligible for law enforcement assistance and technical assistance and antimoney laundering grants. 
This bill is not based on hypotheticals--it was not drafted out of thin air--it is based on hands-on experience of what has worked for our drug enforcement agencies. We have learned that the most effective method of fighting this problem is for law enforcement agencies to work together. That is why we have called for a national strategy. And that is why the bill directs the Secretary to give special preference to law enforcement or prosecutorial agencies that coordinate activities when awarding grants to combat money laundering. 
This approach has proven successful in a recent New York undercover operation known as `El Dorado'. This joint law enforcement effort used a Treasury Department tool known as a GTO-Geographic Targeting Order. Under the GTO, designated money remitters were required to report detailed information about all cash transfers to Columbia over $750. The results of Operation `El Dorado' were phenomenal: 
Cash transfers by three major remitters plummeted from $67 million to $2 million; 
The overall number of transactions by those same remitters dropped 95 percent and the dollar amount dropped 97 percent; 
There has been $30 million in currency seizures, three arrests and one conviction. 
Most importantly, Operation `El Dorado' disrupted the profit flow from the United State to the drug cartels. 
Operation El Dorado was a huge success--but it was limited by the nature of the GTO itself--it is a temporary legal device. We need to stop these criminals forever! 
Our experience in New York demonstrates that only a comprehensive and cooperative solution will achieve results. We must take decisive and immediate steps to stop this insidious cancer from rotting away at our country's legitimate economy and financial system. This bill would essentially put in place a permanent GTO in high risk areas.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my colleagues' attention a column by Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post that was published in today's edition on page A19. This column is entitled `'Diktat' From Washington,' and discusses what happened after the announcement that the United States would support only the admission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into NATO. 
As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, better known as the Helsinki Commission, I held a series of hearings on human rights and NATO enlargement, and last week released a Commission report assessing the readiness of candidate states to join the Alliance, based upon our evaluation of their human rights compliance. In the course of these hearings, I expressed my support for the inclusion of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Romania in the first round of NATO expansion. 
Now, Mr. Hoagland has recounted how the U.S. policy choice was conveyed to our allies and how they received it, both before and at the Summit of the Eight, just concluded in Denver. I commend this account to my colleagues and suggest that they consider what Hoagland calls the creation of at least a temporary line dividing nations that suffered equally under Soviet rule, and its probable consequences in central and eastern Europe. 
While I do not believe that equality of suffering is the standard by which candidate NATO members should be judged, I am afraid that omitting Slovenia, Romania, and the Baltic states could cause future problems that could be avoided if we admitted them now. I will have more to say on this subject as we approach the Madrid Summit.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, a number of recent studies have demonstrated that investments in medical research can lower health care costs through the development of more cost-effective treatments. Greater funding for research will also increase our ability to combat diseases which are very costly to our Nation's health care system. We voted on May 21, 1997, 98 to 0, to double the amount of funding for NIH so we can advance our biomedical research capabilities. This impressive show of support from this body will help reduce health care costs and increase the quality of health for all of our citizens. 
Voting to increase funding was easy. Now comes the hard part. Where do we get the money? We must not take money from other vital programs such as food stamps or senior citizen benefits. Can we afford to give more money for breast cancer research and take away money from programs for children? There would be no end to the debate on which is more worthy of our priorities. 
There is a better way to get funds for biomedical research without cutting from other programs. I suggest that each year the Secretary of the Treasury determine whether the actual revenue impact of the capital gains provisions of this bill are more positive--more revenues gained or less lost--than levels called for in revenue scoring of this provision. If the impact is more positive, half of the revenues will be put toward deficit reduction. We could then take the other half and deposit it into a National Fund for Health Research. This fund will expand support for medical research through the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. 
I believe that if we acquire the money for the fund in this way we can avoid hurting other programs. Using money when there is a more positive revenue will keep us within the bounds of the balanced budget agreement. I don't believe there is a better place to put this excess money than in the research fund. 
Mr. President, every one of us, the entire Senate called for an increase in funding for biomedical research. Again, I suggest that there is no better place to put the more positive revenue than in this fund. I believe that the establishment of this trust fund should be made in the same cooperative spirit that brought the entire Senate to agree to increase funding on May 21. We can then go home feeling proud that we did all we could to further advance our country's medical capabilities and in time reduce the costs of our entire health care system. 
 Mr. President, we voted 98 to 0 to do this. This is a matter which we can prove that we meant it. Any additional moneys will go to deficit reduction and to NIH.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, to submit concurrent resolution to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention through the issuance of a U.S. postage stamp. 
American women in the middle part of the 19th century had few distinguishable rights. They did not possess the right to vote, participate in government and if married, were not allowed to own property or keep wages if they worked outside of the home. In the summer of 1848, a group of five women sought to change these circumstances. 
On July 19 and 20, 1848, 300 women and men converged on Wesleyan Methodist Church in Seneca Falls, NY to consider `the social, civil and religious condition of women' at that time. Led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, Jane Hunt, Ann McClintock and Martha Wright, a Declaration of Sentiments was presented to the audience which listed among them `all men and women are created equal' and that `women's political equality with man is the legitimate outgrowth of the fundamental principles of our government as set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.' 
This historic Convention marked a turning point in the condition of women in American society. The public airing of the Declaration of Sentiments began a progressive pursuit of equality for women that has endured to this day. 
The issuance of this stamp will honor the courage that these early leaders had in presenting their convictions and pursuing change for all women. Through the issuance of a commemorative stamp, the commitment to women's rights will be celebrated. I encourage my colleagues to join Senator Moynihan and me by cosponsoring this measure.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, thousands of Italian-Americans became innocent victims of wartime fever--a panicked and a paranoid reaction that all people of foreign extraction linked to belligerent countries were spies, sabatours and un-American. Fear of fifth columnists and quisling-type activities led government officials to abridge the civil rights of Americans who came from warring countries. Patriotic propaganda villifying the treachery of sneak attacks, blitzkrieg and totalitarian domination had an effect on the homefront view of Italian, German and Japanese immigrants as well as naturalized citizens, inducing discrimination. Initial mistakes were magnified by protective zeal into wholesale judgements about aliens, which led to the detainment, internment and harassment of these people. 
That is why, Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues Senator Chafee and Torricelli to right a terrible wrong that happened in this country over 50 years ago. In a country that so cherishes its equality among men and women, and boasts its democratic process, the United States has a dark spot in its history. Most Americans are not aware of the tragedy experienced by so many fellow citizens over half a century ago, a tragedy committed by the American government against people of Italian descent. 
In early 1942, 600,000 aliens of Italian descent were deemed to be `enemy aliens' and were forced to re-register and carry identification. Our government restricted their travel to their neighborhoods and classified normal household items, such as shortwave radios, cameras, flashlights and weapons as contraband material in their possession. 
On February 19, 1942, an Executive Order was issued giving the Secretary of War the authority to exclude American citizens as well as alien enemies, from such areas as the Secretary should designate. Americans now realize that this provision began a dark period of American history, authorizing the internment of immigrants residing in the United States as well as American citizens. While most Americans are aware of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, few are aware that Italians and German legal residents of the United States were also restricted. 
Italian immigrants, Italian-Americans and their families were viewed as a genuine threat to American security at the beginning of World War II. Fear and ethnic bias led to the relocation of nearly 10,000 members of the Italian community from their homes on the West Coast. Hundreds of people were taken from their homes and brought to guarded army camp in areas as far east as Minnesota. 
And all this effort and anxiety for naught- even by war's end, not a single act of sabotage was attributable to Italian-Americans. On the contrary, Italians fought in America's victorious forces in the European and Asian theater and thousands made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation's survival. 
As one could imagine, the effects on these families were disastrous. Four men committed suicide. These men (Martini Battistessa, Guiseppe Micheli, Giovanni Sanguenetti and Stefano Terranova) suffered at the hands of government officials. Italian American fisherman were grounded, their livelihood gone. 
Several experts have taken a look at the treatment of Italian Americans during the early 1940's. Stephen Fox wrote a book called The Unknown Internment: An Oral History of the Relocation of Italian Americans during World War II. In the preface, Stephen Fox describes the horrific treatment of people whose only crime was being of Italian descent in America during World War II. 
Salvatore J. LaGumina, Professor of History and Director of the Center for Italian American Studies at Nassau Community College wrote an article in the Italian American Review called `Enemy Alien: Italian Americans During World War II'. In the article he states: 
`A ban on Italian language radio programs affected stations in New York City and Boston. Various Italian American newspapers suspended publication at least during the war years and in some instances ceased publication permanently. Customary Italian religious feast celebrations were likewise deferred or significantly diminished . . . In Westbury, Long Island, most Italian American organizations suspended their traditional feast celebrations for the duration of the war except for the Dell'Assunta Society which insisted it be allowed to march on the village streets during its festival, on the grounds that it was a religious not an ethnic celebration. 
Robert Masulla, writing for the Italic Way Newsletter, cited that Italian immigrant fishermen were denied their livelihood and some `even had their boats impounded by the U.S. government and utilized for patrol and minesweeping duties'. 
It was not until October 12, 1942 that Italian immigrants were removed from the enemy alien category. Mr. Fox's historical study indicated that the internment effort was abandoned because the alien relocation would overly tax the U.S. Army's already over-extended logistical network, threaten the defense industry and lower civilian morale. 
In 1988, this body finally faced a terrible past that we could no longer ignore--the internment of immigrants from Japan or Japanese-Americans. Now it is time to provide recognition and remorsefulness for the treatment of Italian aliens and Italian Americans who had to endure the horrific actions of our own government--a government that has stood for freedom, not oppression. 
That is why I have joined with my colleagues in the House of Representatives, particularly its lead sponsors, Congressmen Engel and Lazio, to introduce this bill, the `Wartime Violation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act'. Its provisions are clear and straight-forward: 
It recognizes the treatment of Italian Americans during World War II. 
It calls on the President to formally acknowledge that the civil liberties of Italian Americans were violated in the United States in the early 1940's. 
It encourages federal agencies to support projects which increase the public's awareness of the internment of Italians during the Second World War. 
It states that the President and Congress provide direct funding in order to educate the American public through a film documentary, particularly to document the testimony of the survivors of the internment. 
It recommends the formation of an advisory committee to assist in the compilation of historical data, to accurately reflect the incidents that transpired. 
It calls on the Department of Justice to publish a report on the U.S. Government's role in the internment. 
The facts need to be told in order to acknowledge that these events happened, to remember those who lived through the humiliation and to discourage any similar injustices from occurring in the future.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President on behalf of Senator Harkin, myself, Senators Mack, Jeffords, Specter, and Rockefeller, we offer an amendment that will fulfill this Chamber's commitment, a commitment that it made on January 21 when it voted 89-0 to double the amount of funding for the National Institutes of Health to provide medical research. Everybody says we need more money for cancer research, heart research, and for Alzheimer's and diabetes. We say we are going to do it and we never do it. 
This amendment says that any excessive funds that are saved, over and above that anticipated by this budget resolution, by Medicare and Medicaid, certified by the CBO, will then be utilized to meet these functions. Only after CBO has certified that there are excess savings will those savings be placed in this account. 
Mr. President, that is keeping our commitment.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I guess it was about 5, 6 years ago, my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, came to me and said, `You know, we haven't been able to get sufficient funding for breast cancer research because there are those who object to our attempt to take it from defense and transfer it over to NIH.' I think we had just been rebuffed 50 some odd to 42 or 43. 
Then he said, `How about us keeping that money in the defense budget. After all, a significant portion of the military will be women. This is a matter of national health in our defense of our families.' And we came forth with that proposal, and we were able to get a huge vote. 
Since that point in time, forget about votes, we have produced, in addition to what was being funded by NIH, something in excess of $600 million for breast cancer research, and it has made a difference. 
My colleague, once again, has come forth and said this time, `Alfonse, why don't we look to meet the needs that this body itself has acknowledged in their overwhelming vote on January 21, 1997,' when Senator Mack and my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, myself and others, who offered an amendment which was designed to say, let us double, we call it the biomedical commitment research resolution, and it is so easy for us to vote for it because we voted to say yes, we want to double the amount of money going into NIH for biomedical research because the demands are incredible, absolutely incredible. So we voted 100 to 0. 
Now comes the problem. How do we fund it? Notwithstanding that the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, is making every effort to find the funds, where does he get them? Where does he get them? What program does he cut? Does he cut food stamps further? We just heard an eloquent presentation as it relates to the needs of children. What senior citizen program does he cut it from? We have already seen the battles when we look for funds. Do we give more money to breast cancer research at the expense of diabetes? What about emerging infectious diseases? Incredible, frightening if you read what is going on. 
Let me tell you, the investment of moneys into biomedical research will pay great dividends, it will save lives, it will result in savings many, many, many times more than what we invest, and it is so necessary. I think about 80 to 90 percent of the worthy applications by some of the great medical research centers of this country are being turned down, not because they are deficient, but because we simply don't have the money. 
I have to tell you something, there is nothing better that we can be investing money in than in terms of medical research for the prevention of illnesses, for finding out the cures, for doing the genetic research, for doing all of that work that so many of us talk about. We go home and say, `Yes, I am going to vote to increase it.' Here is what we do. 
Let us take the cumulated savings annually from Medicare and Medicaid that this bill provides. Let me tell you, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, deserves the appreciation and accolades of everyone, Democrat and Republicans, because he has crafted a bill that is designed to control costs and to produce savings. Let CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, look at the end of each fiscal year how much in the way of savings have been accumulated and provide these moneys be set aside to be used exactly for that which we voted 100 to 0, biomedical research in NIH. 
Let us not fight to take money from one program that is so desperately needed, whether it be for senior citizens, whether it be for food stamps, and then say we are going to make winners of some at the expense of others and not nearly meet the needs. 
If we looked at the last 4 years, we will see we increased the total appropriations in these accounts by about $400 million a year. That is not going to meet our commitment when we are talking about increasing it by $2.5 billion annually. 
Mr. President, again, this does not impact, it does not need a revenue offset. If the revenues are not generated, the savings, no expenditure. If they are, I suggest we couldn't find a better and finer place to put those moneys. If someone wants to then come in and make an amendment to take part of those moneys and put them someplace else, they can come to the floor and we can argue it out. But I believe the establishment of that trust fund keeps the promise we made, that we attempt to look for ways to find the moneys that we all came out here on the floor and voted for. 
I commend my colleague. It has been a great privilege and pleasure for me to work with him in this endeavor.

Mr. DAMATO. First of all, let me say there is no one that I have greater respect for and no one who I admire more than my colleague and friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. And I would ask, if the Senator might be willing, between now and the time the amendment comes up, to look at the question of the trust fund. As far as I am concerned, and I think I speak for my colleague, if that were one of the important issues, I think we could put that aside and have those moneys allocated directly into NIH. 
I would also indicate that I think in the draftsmanship of this we provided that it would be only the year after on the look-back that the Congressional Budget Office would ascertain whether or not the mark we have set, which would be set in law, by the way--this will no longer be an estimate, be set in law--that if it has been achieved and there has been an excess in the way of savings, that those dollars then would go into this account at NIH for biomedical research. 
Understand, it is exactly my friend's point that no one really knows where to get the money and that here is an opportunity to say that if we do achieve these savings, yes, that we are making a judgment now; that if we do, we are making a judgment to see that these dollars will be allocated for these areas, whether it is Alzheimer's research, diabetes, cancer, research on the brain. 
I mean, the fact is, we desperately, desperately need these moneys. And here is an opportunity to identify with specificity and, yes, to come forward and say, yes, if we have an extra $500 million or $1 billion, that it will go into that account. And we will be making that commitment that we talked about a reality. 
So I ask my colleague and friend to just look at it in terms of if there needs to be some additional language to tighten this up and to deal with some of the parliamentary objections. And if there is a real question whether or not you want to set up a trust fund for this, that possibly we could deal with that in the manner that would facilitate the spirit of that resolution that was passed saying we must do more. Because I believe that the spirit was there and the recognition that we have to do more in biomedical research. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate John Giovanni and Carmella Seminerio Gandolfo of Lynbrook, NY. After 50 years of love, hard work and spirit, the two are about to renew their marriage vows and celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. As I remark on this union, created in Aragona, Sicily, half a century ago, I must comment that their unconditional love for each other is equal to the one they share for their community. 
John and Carmella reside in Lynbrook where John is now retired from the construction industry and Carmella is a dedicated homemaker. Mr. and Mrs. Gandolfo have been blessed with three children, and five grandchildren. Family and friends see the couple as a tower of strength, support, understanding, and limitless love. They have passed these same attributes on to their loved ones, creating a model family that is admired by their community. Their marriage serves as a milestone to be duplicated by others. 
This record does not do justice to commemorate the longevity of such an event of triumph, tenacity, and joy. John and Carmella's marriage embodies what all citizens should try to achieve, and captures the true meaning of love and citizenship. Once again, I would like to congratulate John and Carmella on their joyous day. I hope these renewed vows will add another 50 years of fortune to their lives.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Community Health Care Access Act of 1997. This act will help ensure that the residents of our inner-city and rural areas, in New York and across the Nation, will have increased access to affordable health care. This legislation will establish a procedure within the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] for foreign medical students, who are granted temporary residency status in order to complete their medical education, to retain their legal status in exchange for practicing in areas with serious physician shortages. 
Mr. President, throughout my home State of New York, there are numerous inner-city and rural communities which face a real crisis in the availability of qualified physicians. Too often, these communities face enormous difficulty attracting physicians to help serve the needs of their residents. Physicians are desperately needed to help cope with the growing incidence of drug-resistant tuberculosis, HIV, and other infectious diseases, as well as other critical health care needs such as pre-natal and neo-natal care. 
The act I am introducing today will help address this crisis by requiring the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to request a J-1 visa waiver for any qualified medical professional who agrees to practice in an underserved area. This bill will allow hundreds of qualified doctors who are willing and able to serve in these communities to partner with existing health care facilities in order to serve needy populations who lack access to affordable health care. 
This legislation will help hospitals which are located in areas which are designated by the Department of Health and Human Services [HHS] as `Health Professional Shortage Areas' to draw upon a pool of doctors who are among the best and the brightest in the world. Currently, there is a severe shortage of U.S. medical residents who are willing to serve in these areas. These urban and rural areas often have large uninsured populations with a variety of critical unmet health needs. 
In a nation with the greatest health care system in the world, there exist communities which are unfairly denied access to affordable quality health care. This disparity can be seen both in isolated rural areas and in the high-impact urban cores of some of our largest cities. Too often, the members of these communities have been left out of the American dream. It is intolerable that certain parts of many American cities are experiencing higher infant mortality rates than many third-world countries. 
The costs of providing health care increase as hospitals struggle to attract qualified physicians. As costs rise, the unmet health care needs of local residents are exacerbated. Thus, the supply shortage of qualified physicians creates a vicious cycle in which local residents are trapped. 
My legislation will help break this cycle by increasing the availability of doctors in 
underserved areas while reducing health care costs. 
Let me briefly provide some background information. Under the J-1 visa program, foreign medical students are temporarily admitted to the United States in order to complete their medical education and clinical training. Upon completion of their education, these students are required to leave the United States for a minimum of 2 years before they can become eligible for an extension of their legal residency status. However, current law provides an exception to this 2-year foreign residency requirement if the medical graduate agrees to practice in a designated `Health Professional Shortage Area.' 
Congress reaffirmed its commitment to the J-1 program, as well as to the waiver of the 2-year foreign residency requirement for international medical graduates who agree to practice in underserved areas, when it passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996--Public Law 104-208. This Act was signed into law on September 30, 1996. 
Mr. President, in December 1996, the General Accounting Office [GAO] released a report assessing the J-1 visa waiver program. This report, entitled `Foreign Physicians: Exchange Visitor Program Becoming Major Route to Practicing in U.S. Underserved Areas' noted the growing use of the visa waiver process and made several recommendations for improvement. 
In conjunction with the reforms enacted last year as part of the Immigration Reform Act, the legislation I introduce today will effectively implement several of the recommendations made by the GAO. As noted in the report, last year's Immigration Reform Act required Federal agencies to utilize the same criteria for approval that previously applied to State health departments seeking such waivers. These new safeguards required physicians to: First, agree to work for at least 3 years for the health facility named in the application; second, work in an area designated by the Secretary of HHS as having a shortage of health care professionals; third, commence work within 90 days of receipt of the waiver; and fourth, maintain a nonimmigrant status until the completion of the 3-year commitment term. In addition, physicians who fail to comply with the terms of their agreements would face a termination of their residency status and a loss of eligibility to apply for legal immigrant status in the future. 
This legislation would further improve compliance with the waiver requirements. This act will address the GAO report's finding that Federal agencies need to improve coordination in granting waivers. The act requires HUD to report to HHS on the number and location of physicians requesting waivers. I fully expect the Department of Health and Human Services to utilize this information in its annual designations of physician underserved areas. In addition, the legislation would require the sponsoring hospitals to provide HUD with periodic notices as to the compliance of physicians with the terms of the waiver agreements. Hospitals will also be required to provide HUD with immediate notice of the termination or cessation of compliance with these terms. 
The addition of these reforms will ensure the effective continuation of this vital program. 
The GAO noted that, as of January 1, 1996, there were approximately 1,374 physicians admitted to practice in underserved areas through the J-1 visa waiver program. These physicians served in 49 States and the District of Columbia. According to a survey conducted by the General Accounting Office, approximately 40 percent of these physicians served in nonprofit community or migrant health care centers. Almost all of these physicians were practicing in primary care specialties. More than half were practicing in internal medicine. The other major specialties were pediatrics and family practice. 
Mr. President, it is important to note the outstanding caliber and the unique qualifications of the doctors participating in this program. In order to receive a J-1 visa, many of the participants were accepted into medical universities and world-renowned teaching hospitals with rigorous acceptance standards. In some cases, the admitted physicians are often specifically recruited by particular health facilities on the basis of their superior foreign language skills and cultural familiarity. For instance, the GAO cited a migrant health center in eastern Washington which actively recruited native-Spanish speakers for its program. 
HUD plays a critical role in the reduction of health care costs. The agency operates a number of programs which benefit hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care organizations. The role played by HUD's hospital insurance program, for instance, is absolutely essential for many health care institutions in obtaining private market financing for hospital construction, renovation, and modernization. The credit enhancement provided by this program results in a tangible reduction in health care costs at little or no cost to the taxpayer. 
I believe it is essential for Congress to continue to act expeditiously to address the valid concerns raised by the GAO. At the same time, we must remain cognizant of the basic soundness of the waiver program and strive to improve and reform it. The waiver process has made basic health care available to many communities with desperate needs. 
Mr. President, in conclusion I would emphasize the hardships which face many of our Nation's urban and rural residents as a result of the crisis in health care availability. The J-1 visa waiver program is an important tool to address these needs. The reforms to the current waiver process are also critical to ensuring that any noncompliance within the program is eradicated. I urge my colleagues to support the Community Health Care Access Act of 1997 in order to ensure that the waiver program remains a viable option in addressing our country's local health care needs for years to come.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend all those assisting in the ongoing Senate Banking Committee Inquiry into Holocaust Assets. 
I must start with the leading role of the World Jewish Congress, particularly Edgar Bronfman who along with WJC Secretary General Israel Singer brought this issue to me on December 7, 1995. Their work, along with that of Elan Steinberg has been a true force to reckon with for the Swiss banks. 
I cannot forget the absolutely invaluable help of Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat and his very able staff in finding and preparing the administration's exhaustive report on the subject. Of particular help has been the work of Judy Barnett. She has fought the tough interagency battles to establish the truth. State Department Historian Bill Slany did an incredible job in assembling the report. 
I want to also thank the following members of the various departments of the U.S. Government: Francine Barber, Abby Gilbert, David Joy, Felix Hernandez, Judy Liberson, Bill McFadden, Eli Rosenbaum, Ruth Van Heuven, and Barry White. 
I hope that I have not left out anyone. 
The National Archives at College Park has been nothing less then amazing. The staff has gone out of their way to provide our researchers with help, including declassification, record and document locations, use of their facilities, overall access to the building and records, and the wisdom, and advice of the gifted archivists. Put all together, their help was indispensable in establishing, continuing and expanding the research of the Committee. 
Of particular help to our staff and researchers has been that of Greg Bradshear who compiled the finding aid for the various record groups of documents, Calvin Jefferson who has provided us with every appropriate extension of help with regard to use of the Textual Reference Room, Clarence Lyons for his help in the overall effort, Cary Conn for his help in declassifying hundreds of boxes of documents, and John Taylor for his wisdom and guidance. In addition to these fine and dedicated people, I would like to thank the following for their help in our effort: Rich Boylan, Rebecca Collier, David Giordano, Milt Gustafson, Ken Heger, Marty McGann, Wil Mahoney, William Deutscher, Robert Coren, Tim Nenninger, David Pfieiffer, Fred Ramanski, Ken Schlessinger, Amy Schmidt, Donald Singer, Marilyn Stachelczyk, Carolyn Powell, Dr. Michael Kurz, R. Michael McReynolds, Peter Jefferies, and Lee Rose. 
Again, I hope that I have not left out anyone. I am truly grateful for their help to my staff and the researchers. 
In regard to the researchers, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for their unwavering support to the committee by their provision of interns to us for the research. Of particular help and support, and for which this part of the project could not have gotten off the ground, I have to thank Walter Reich and Stan Turesky. Specifically without Stan, we could not have done the research among many other aspect of this inquiry. 
The museum provided the committee with top rate college students to conduct the research. I would like to thank the following researchers for their dedicated work: Charles Borden, Rick Crowley, Polly Crozier, Joshua Cypress, Mary Helen Dupree, Ben Fallon, Aaron Field, David Ganz, Avi Glazer, Jessica Hammer, Anantha Hans, Miriam Haus, Olivia Joly, Kelsey Libner, Mary McCleery, Daniel Renna, Adam Sonfield, Hannah Trooboff, Kevin Vinger, and Brian Wahl. 
Hannah Trooboff did excellent work with her research at the various research archives in and around New York City. She did this research while attending Columbia University. 
Additionally, I would like to thank those who were either volunteers, interns, or Legislative Fellows in my office who participated in the research Marc Isser, now a member of my staff was an early member of the research team and the third person out at the archives to dig through the records Marc Mazurovsky was extremely helpful in aiding our effort by pointing us in the right direction and helping us with the record groups. Sid Zabludoff provided help with particular record group sources as well. 
Moreover, I want to extend particular thanks to the dogged research of a Legislative Fellow in my office, B.J. Moravek, who was the man who interviewed and tracked down dozens of survivors, found information that no one else could have found, and was as dedicated as anyone could possibly be to obtain the truth about the misdeeds of the Swiss bankers. 
I also want to thank another Legislative Fellow in my office, Brian Hufker. Brian has been indispensable in translating documents from the German and French languages and researching for the complicated and vast amount of detail involved in this inquiry. I am proud to have him as a member of my staff. 
I also have to thank Miriam Kleiman who was literally the first person in the archives for us researching this subject. She has been diligent, dedicated, and totally committed to achieving justice for the victims of the Holocaust, survivors, and heirs who have assets in Swiss banks. While the term indispensable might be overused, she truly has been She found the first `five-star' documents, and she continues finding them today as she continues her fine work for this worthy topic. 
In addition, I want to thank Willi Korte, who along with Miriam was there from the beginning and continues to this day to help in the cause. Willi has selflessly dedicated his time, efforts, vast knowledge on the subject, and even his own resources to get to the truth. 
My greatest debt of gratitude goes to my legislative director, Gregg Rickman. Gregg was with me from the very beginning of this inquiry. He spent countless hours toiling through thousands of pages of documentation from so many sources. He also worked behind the scenes to organize four Senate Banking Committee hearings and numerous meetings with many of the principals involved. There was no institutional knowledge on this subject when we started. The inquiry evolved through a painstaking learning process derived from listening to the tragic recollections of Holocaust victims and their descendants, and conducting persistent detective work. In the latter Gregg has no equal. Gregg, I thank you and your wife, Sonia, who made personal sacrifices to see that some measure of justice is achieved. 
Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of these fine people who made the revelations and discoveries of the past year and more possible. I mean this when I say that they have all made history. They have contributed to correcting a great injustice and have tried with all of their might to set history straight. They should be proud of their work and I know that the claimants and survivors would agree. For my part, I am immensely proud of their effort and I heartily congratulate them for their fine work. While there is still a great amount of work to be done, we could not have gotten even this far without all of these fine people.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, this year John J. DePierro, president and chief executive officer of the Sisters of Charity Health Care System, celebrates a milestone in his career. For 25 years he has served the Sisters of Charity health care efforts on Staten Island in New York City. In so doing, he has given vision to the health care mission of the sisters and has been a pivotal force in insuring the success of the many institutions of human service that comprise the Sisters of Charity Health Care System. 
Through St. Vincent's Medical Center of Richmond, a broad array of acute care services are made available to the community including maternal and child care programs, centers of excellence in cardiology and oncology, a broad array of psychiatric and addiction services and an active emergency medicine program. 
Through Bayley Seton Hospital which was the former Public Health Service Hospital which Mr. DePierro played a key role in providing for its transition to community service working closely with me, a strong range of outpatient services together with inpatient programs with specific emphasis on the centers of excellence of dermatology and ophthalmology are available to the community. As with St. Vincent's, there is an effective emergency medicine program to meet the needs of the surrounding community. 
Bayley Seton has also, working closely with me, forged a productive relationship with the Department of Defense to provide military health care as a uniformed services treatment facility. 
In 1994, St. Elizabeth Ann's Health Care and Rehabilitation Center became a reality and through it a range of chronic, subacute and rehabilitative services were provided for the community of Staten Island. Special populations that are served include persons with AIDS as well as ventilator-dependent patients. 
The system also has concerned itself with insuring a continuum of community-based services. Pax Christi Hospice, a home-based hospice program, has served the needs of Staten Islanders since 1988 and the Sisters of Charity Home Health Care Program meets their posthospital needs. 
To Mr. DePierro's abiding credit, he has also concerned himself with other human needs of the community of Staten Island. Through his commitment, three senior housing programs have been developed to provide over 225 residential units of housing for seniors. He is also seeing to the needs of the employees of the system with the development of the Sister Elizabeth Boyle Child Learning Center which provides day care services for both the staff of the corporations of the system, let alone the community. 
It is rare in the context of health care today to see an individual have such long and illustrious tenure in an institution. This is made all the more unique by the strength that has been created in the vertically integrated health care delivery system that is the Sisters of Charity. 
Mr. DePierro's background speaks to his capacity as a hospital administrator and health care leader. A graduate of St. Peter's College with a master's in business administration majoring in hospital administration from George Washington University, he completed a residency in hospital administration at Bellevue Hospital Center. He is a fellow of the American College of Health Care Executives, a member of the American Hospital Association, the American Public Health Association and the Public Health Association of New York City. 
He has served as a regent for New York State for the American College of Health Care Executives. He has lent his significant leadership to the professional associations of the industry including serving as a member of the board of governors of the Greater New York Hospital Association of which he is also past chairman as well as a member of the board of the Healthcare Association of New York State of which he is also a past chairman. He has been a delegate to the regional advisory board II of the American Hospital Association and currently serves as chairperson of the hospital advisory council of the Catholic Health Care Network of the Archdiocese of New York. 
Mr. DePierro, despite the heavy demands on his professional responsibilities, makes time to serve on the board of the Seton Foundation for Learning which provides educational programs in the Catholic tradition for special children. He is also a past president of the foundation. 
A man committed to his family, he and his wife, Jeanne, are the proud parents of four children and delight in their six grandchildren--soon to be seven. 
All of this, Mr. President, gives testimony to the capacity of a single individual motivated and concerned about the needs of others to work effectively over the course of time to insure that those needs are provided for effectively and good works are accomplished by harnessing the involvement of others and by personal example. 
I am proud of the strong relationship that I have enjoyed with the Sisters of Charity Health Care System over the years and the opportunities that I have had to work with Mr. DePierro in the transition of Bayley Seton Hospital, the provision of military health care and the development of housing programs. 
I know of his forthright commitment and his unquestioned integrity in his dealings will all. These traits are exemplary of the pattern of care of the Sisters of Charity on Staten Island. 
I join with Mr. DePierro's countless friends and associates in wishing him professional and personal success in the years ahead. I trust too Mr. President that knowing of John's fondness for golf, that his handicap will be reduced in inverse ratio to his years of service with the Sisters of Charity and his hole-in-one shot in Aruba was only the first of many. 
I share the prayer of those who are honoring John at a celebration on Staten Island on Tuesday, July 1, that he shall continue to be blessed with good health and a steadfast concern for others.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Chafee, Senator Moynihan, Senator Breaux, Senator Hatch, and Senator Bob Graham in introducing legislation that will induce investment and create employment in Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans have been U.S. citizens since 1917. Since World War I an estimated 200,000 Puerto Ricans have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. Yet, the Puerto Rican unemployment rate is more than twice the national average, its annual per capita income is less than half the national average, and well over 50 percent of its population live below the poverty line. We as a Congress must take action to bring Puerto Rico's economy up to the levels that we expect for all Americans. 
Under current law, section 30A of the Internal Revenue Code provides a targeted wage credit to companies during business in Puerto Rico based upon the compensation paid to their employees. It does not allow new business starts and the credit terminates in 2006. As a result, existing companies have little incentive to make new investments or replace depreciating plant and equipment. Job losses will occur as existing plants are shut down and these activities may be transferred to foreign locations. Net job growth can only occur if new firms start up and if expanding firms replace job losses. Manufacturing accounts for more than 40 percent of Puerto Ricos gross domestic product. 
This legislation expands section 30A to provide an employer tax credit for employees located in Puerto Rico that will also cover new businesses. This credit is based upon the compensation to their employees. The credit will only remain until economic conditions improve within Puerto Rico including an unemployment rate not to exceed 150 percent of the U.S. average, per capita income is at least 66 percent of the national average, and that the poverty level does not exceed 30 percent. The economic conditions for the tax incentives to end are modest but achieve significant economic progress for the people of Puerto Rico. 
This legislation serves U.S. fiscal interests. Without spurring job creation in Puerto Rico, the United States will be paying unemployment and welfare benefits to people that have a strong work ethic and impressive job skills. Puerto Rico has a labor force of 1.3 million people. Of this total approximately 190,000 are available for employment. We must do everything possible to help facilitate employment for these people. 
Even though Puerto Rico is located 1,600 miles southeast of New York City, the people of New York have a direct interest in the Puerto Rican economy. Puerto Rican subsidiaries of mainland companies purchase approximately $195 million per year worth of supplies and services from New York. Corporations headquartered in New York State that have invested in Puerto Rico employ over 39,000 persons in New York. If corporations are drawn to other regions where there are tax incentives, New York State will not only lose jobs but also significant amounts of income from goods and services. 
Mr. President, this legislation is a powerful economic development initative that is vital to Puerto Rico because of the many hurdles the people face in their struggle for development. The island faces much higher transportation costs than most States; an infrastructure which still needs billions in investment to bring it up to acceptable standards and it is faced with competition within the Caribbean and other locations which pay wages a fraction of Puerto Rico's. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Baucus in introducing legislation that will amend the Tax Code to provide a permanent extension of a grandfather provision contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987. This 10 year grandfather provision was provided for publicly traded partnerships [PTP's] that were in existence as of December 17, 1987. A PTP is a partnership whose interests are traded on established securities exchanges or are readily tradable in secondary markets. 
Included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 is section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code. The section provides that PTP's will generally be taxed as corporations; income or loss does not pass through to the partners. Section 7704 does not apply, however, to PTP's where 90 percent or more of their income is qualifying income, such as from interest, dividends, real estate, timber, oil, and gas. This exception applies regardless when the PTP was formed. Other PTP's in existence when section 7704 was enacted were grandfathered, but only for 10 years, through 1997. Our legislation would extend the grandfather provision permanently. 
The purpose of section 7704 according to the committee reports was intended to stop the long term erosion of the corporate tax base. There was a concern that much of corporate America would convert to PTP's resulting in a decline of corporate tax revenues. 
This purpose has been achieved because of the prospective application of that section. There were approximately 120 PTP's in existence in 1987 and because of the legislation the number of PTP's did not snowball. Permanently grandfathering PTP's would not defeat the purpose of the 1987 legislation since the grandfather applies only to those PTP's that were in existence at the time of the 1987 legislation. 
Fairness to the owners of the PTP's that were grandfathered during the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 is an important issue. The conversion from a corporation to a PTP was a costly and 
time-consuming process. The companies that converted to PTP form relied on the expectation that they would be able to operate as partnerships as long as they wanted. The conversion process involved consultation with investment bankers, appraisals, planning by corporate finance, securities and tax lawyers, multiple filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and State securities agencies, proxy statements and shareholder votes, et cetera. This process would not have been started or completed had there been any reasonable prospect that a change in the tax law would have applied retroactively or after a limited period of time. Failure to pass this legislation will be punishing PTPs that played by the rules. 
If the grandfather is not made permanent many of these same costs will be incurred once again. Grandfathered PTP's will be forced to convert to corporate form by January 1998. To do so will require lengthy planning, and the same investment banking advice, appraisals and attorney fees. The need for extensive, advance planning makes it essential that the matter be resolved this year. These PTP's relied on the law in effect before passage of the 1987 act and it is unreasonable and unfair to now force these PTP's to undergo this expensive, time consuming process to convert to corporate form. No public purpose will be served by such forced conversions. 
The loss of the grandfather will hurt PTP investors and employees of the companies. The value of PTP units will decline if the grandfather is not permanently implemented. Most of these investors are average, middle-class taxpayers who have invested in PTP units oftentimes through an individual retirement account, because of the desire for a safe, liquid investment. As PTP units decline in value, a company's ability to expand will be negatively affected and the employees will suffer. 
We do not achieve any tax policy goal by honoring the 10-year grandfather. That goal was fully achieved by making section 7704 apply prospectively. Instead, all we would accomplish by not making the grandfather provision permanent would be harm to these PTP's and their investors. The PTP's operate in all 50 States affecting many of our districts and include a wide variety of industries, from motels and restaurants to chemicals and financial advising. The most recent count indicates that there are well over 300,000 individual investors. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Baucus in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the trigger date for nationwide interstate branching has passed--June 1, 1997. This important legislation will preserve the benefits of the dual banking system and keep the State banking charter competitive in an interstate environment. It is critical that the Senate now consider and pass H.R. 1306, the Riegle-Neal Clarification Act of 1997. 
The dual banking system has served this country well for over 100 years. The State banking system has been the source of major advances in the banking industry for the past 70 years. 
Mr. President, the dual banking system is under attack. The bill is necessary to preserve confidence in a State banking charter for banks with such a charter that wish to operate in more than one State. In addition, it will curtail incentives for unnecessary Federal preemption of State laws. Finally, the bill will restore balance to the dual banking system by ensuring that neither charter operates at an unfair advantage in this new interstate environment. 
Mr. President, the importance of this bill to my State has been communicated by Governor Pataki and the superintendent of banking. New York has more than 90 state-chartered banks with a total of more than half a trillion dollars in assets. These institutions play a vital role in the economic wellbeing of the State of New York. Without this legislation, the largest of these institutions may be tempted to convert to a national charter in order to operate in more than one State. The local bond with these institutions could be broken. New York State bank examiners would be no longer be examining these institutions for compliance with our State community reinvestment and consumer protection laws. 
H.R. 1306 will help prevent this alarming scenario. It protects the dual banking system. 
Mr. President, the problem cured by this bill can be simply described. The current law may be unclear as to whether consistent rules are used to determine what laws and powers apply to the out-of-State branches of State and federally chartered banks. To the extent it remains uncertain that current law establishes rough parity between charters in this regard, some banks may conclude that the national bank charter is the preferable option. This is not a hypothetical concern; Key Corp., one of the largest State-chartered banks in New York, converted to a national bank because of this uncertainty. H.R. 1306 would resolve any such ambiguity. 
First, it would establish that a host State's law would apply to the out-of-State branches of a State-chartered bank only to the same extent that those laws apply to the branches of out-of-State national banks located in the host State. Second, it would make clear that 
host State branches would be allowed to exercise powers granted by their home State if such powers are permissible for either banks chartered by the host State or for national bank branches in that host State. 
Enactment of H.R. 1306 also would bolster efforts in New York and other States to make sure that the State-chartered banks have the powers they need to compete efficiently and effectively in an interstate environment. 
Mr. President, this bill is especially important now because of the efforts of the Comptroller of the Currency to preempt State laws and promote the national bank charter at the expense of the States and other Federal regulators. At a recent oversight hearing, I presented documentation, prepared by the OCC, that confirms that the OCC has mounted an unprecedented, aggressive marketing effort to convince State chartered banks to flip to a national charter. 
I am pleased that our colleagues in the House, particularly Chairman Leach and Representative Roukema, were able to expeditiously guide this bill through the House, where the bill passed on the suspension calendar. I also want to thank my Senate colleagues for their cooperation, especially Senator Sarbanes. 
Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes has reviewed and analyzed carefully the House bill and he has identified the need for a technical clarification to the House-passed bill contained in the amendment we have developed. The amendment would modify the title of the bill, provide a technical clarification to ensure that a national statute that applies to a State-chartered bank in its home State will also apply to a branch of the bank in a host State; and, finally, require the OCC to report to Congress on its preemption decisions since January 1, 1992, and annually thereafter. 
The information yielded by this preemption reporting requirement on the OCC's preemption of State law in numerous areas will assist oversight of the Comptroller's use of preemptive authority. In my judgment, in recent years the OCC has used his authority over national banks to thwart traditional areas of State regulation--such as regulation of insurance and consumer protection. With the benefit of the information and analysis the amendment will require, Congress will be in a better position to determine whether current law regarding preemption is too broad or its administrative interpretation and applications have been too expansive. 
Mr. President, again I thank my distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Sarbanes, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and the bill.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kerry as my primary cosponsor to reintroduce legislation to protect consumers from excessive and redundant fees imposed by automated teller machine [ATM] operators. I am also pleased that Senators Boxer, Bryan, Moseley-Braun, Murray, and Chafee have chosen to join with me once again in cosponsoring this important initiative. 
Mr. President, last year, I introduced legislation to eliminate ATM fees. At that time, some of my colleagues argued that consumers could always choose to go to an ATM that does not double-charge. I predicted then that if we permit this practice, eventually every bank will double-charge consumers would have no choice but to pay through the nose. 
Last fall, I asked the General Accounting Office to examine ATM fees. I want to know how many banks are double charging and how much consumers are being forced to pay. 
This morning the Banking Committee heard GAO's results. Their results detail the spread of the anticonsumer, anticompetitive, and anti-free-market practice--double ATM fees. 
In a nutshell, this abusive practice is spreading like wildfire and consumers across the country are getting burned. When I received the GAO report, I was shocked to find that, in just over a year, the number of ATM's that double charge consumers has risen 320 percent since the end of 1995. That means that consumers have less and less of a choice when they need to use an ATM. 
The GAO study also reveals that 54 percent of the ATM's in the United States are now double-charging. Soon consumers will have nowhere to turn. For that reason, I am reintroducing my bill, the Fair ATM Fees for Consumers Act. 
Until April of last year, most consumers paid a fee, usually about $1, to their own bank each time they used another bank's ATM. This fee was intended to cover the cost of the transaction. Now, in addition to that fee, the ATM operator may charge these consumers a second fee. This second fee can run as high as $3 per transaction. Many consumers are forced to pay a total of $3 or more just to take $20 of their own money out of the bank. That's outrageous. 
Double-charging was prohibited in most of the country until April 1, 1996, when Visa and MasterCard, which operate the two largest ATM networks, endorsed this practice. When the Banking Committee held a hearing on double ATM charges last summer Visa and MasterCard refused to appear. I intend to hold further hearings on this issue and I fully expect Visa and MasterCard to testify as to why they suddenly permitted this double charge which hurts consumers and community banks. 
Recent estimates show that the average consumer is paying a whopping $155 per year to use automated teller machines or ATM's. The average family will pay several times that amount. That's outrageous. The banks are making windfall profits from working people. 
A transaction conducted at an ATM costs about 25 cents while the same transaction conducted by a teller in a bank branch costs well over a dollar. Realizing this, banks strongly encouraged their customers to use ATM's. ATM's appeared everywhere as banks cut bank on branches and teller service. ATM networks were formed when individual banks joined together and agreed to let each other's customers use any ATM in the network without paying any extra charges. 
Now, banks are suddenly claiming that ATM's are no longer cost effective. They have decided to soak consumers with multiple fees every time they need to take money out of their accounts. 
Banks report record profits in part by slapping customers and noncustomers with ever-increasing convenience fees. In many cases, consumers are forced to pay multiple fees for a single ATM transaction. Imagine, working men and women are paying two separate fees for the privilege of getting their own money. 
This is a windfall for the banks. The consumer receives no additional benefit and the bank provides no additional service. A recent study by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group [U.S. PIRG] reported that banks will profit $1.9 billion from ATM surcharges alone this year. This double charge is a free lunch for the banks and consumers are footing the bill. I am not opposed to banks making a profit, but double ATM fees unfairly exploit the consumer. 
Banks argue that consumers have the freedom to go to an ATM that doesn't double-charge. But working people on their lunch hours, or late at night, have no time to hunt for a free ATM when they need cash. As the GAO reported, those free ATM's are getting very hard to find. 
The people who are getting hit the hardest are the ones who can least afford it. While many Americans can simply choose to avoid extra fees by taking $100 or $200 every time they go to an ATM, many families struggling to make ends meet don't have that option. Senior citizens on fixed incomes and students with little money to space are being forced to pay $2 or $3 just to take out $20. A $3 fee on a $200 withdrawal is a nuisance, but taking a $3 bite out of a $20 withdrawal is outrageous. 
Mr. President, double-charging is a monopolistic practice that eliminates competition and distorts the free market. Banks are using double ATM fees to squeeze small competitors out of business. Community banks, thrifts, and credit unions have customers who depend on access to other institutions' ATM's. These customers now pay twice whenever they use an ATM. Large banks with many ATM's are exploiting this situation to lure away small bank customers. Eventually, small banks will not be able to survive. That's not competition, that's a monopoly. 
When ATM's were first introduced, banks claimed that these machines would give consumers more choices and greater convenience. ATM's were supposed to reduce costs and the savings could be passed on to consumers. Today, when bank profits are at record highs, it is astonishing that banks cannot resist the temptation to squeeze consumers a little harder by doubling ATM fees, 
I look forward to holding additional hearings on ATM fees during this Congress to provide opponents and proponents of the bill, including representatives of various States that are attempting to enact bans, an opportunity to participate in this debate. I hope may colleagues will join me in taking a stand against this predatory banking practice.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the language services section of the Congressional Research Service for its support to the Senate Banking Committee in our inquiry into the disposition of heirless assets in Swiss banks, before, during, and after World War II. During the course of our inquiry thousands of pages of documentation have been examined as we have tried to establish the ultimate disposition of assets which were deposited in Swiss banks by Holocaust victims prior to World War II. 
Hundreds of pages of these historical documents were written in various languages which dealt with extremely technical matters. It was imperative that the Banking Committee obtain accurate translations for these documents. The language services section never let us down. 
I would especially like to recognize David Skelly who provided translation support in the German and French languages. Mr. Skelly worked with my staff on a daily basis and his efforts were truly noteworthy. 
On many occasions we contacted Mr. Skelly and solicited his translation assistance on an immediate basis. Mr. Skelly never complained. He never said, `I can't do this. You're asking too much.' He said simply, `How soon do you need it?' and `OK. I'll get right on it.' 
On one particular instance Mrs. Deanna Hammond, Mr. Skelly's supervisor and another true professional in that office, contacted Mr. Skelly at home on his own time and read him a very technical document in German which he translated. Mrs. Hammond typed up the English translation and we had it in our hands 2 hours after sending in our request. 
Mr. President, this is the type of dedicated service which Government employees all too often perform, and no one hears anything about it. You certainly won't hear it from anyone in the language service section. This is all in a day's work for them. This is a group of people who take their commitment to the Congress and the American people very seriously. And they deliver. 
I consider the language services section to be an indispensable office within the Congressional Research Service which provides a truly unique service to the Congress. I congratulate all of the workers there on their fine work and extend to them my thanks.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is and shall remain the undivided capital of the State of Israel. The facts are simple: Jerusalem belongs to Israel for the simple reason that for three millennia, it has been the spiritual, historical, cultural, and moral capital of the Jewish people. In recognition of this fact, the relocation of our Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem should take place as called for in the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 1995. 
Thirty years after reuniting the city after preempting another attack by her surrounding Arab neighbors, Israel has sought to make the city open to people of all faiths and to make the holy sites available to all who come. The fact remains, that Jerusalem has never been the capital of any nation but that of the Jews. That is the way it should remain. 
Mr. President, Jerusalem has been central in the thoughts and minds of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. As the holy city, Jerusalem is the spiritual and religious center of Judaism and is an indivisible part of the State of Israel. 
While I understand that the present Middle East peace negotiations are both complicated and delicate, I do not want anyone to fall under the impression that Jerusalem will belong to anyone other than Israel. If the future of Jerusalem remains unclear in the minds of the Palestinians then they will increase their demands and this will further complicate the already tense negotiations. 
Let the message be clear: A united Jerusalem is off limits to negotiation.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I introduce the Housing 2020: Multifamiy Management Reform Act at the request of the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], the Honorable Andrew M. Cuomo. 
I am a cosponsor of separate legislation to reform HUD's multifamily housing inventory, the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (S. 513). While the Senate and the administration bills share the same objectives, some policy differences exist. Specifically, each bill takes a significantly different approach to the following key issues: project-basing versus tenant-basing; tax implications of debt restructuring; and use of third parties to administer the restructuring program. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and Secretary Cuomo to resolve HUD's multifamily housing crisis as expeditiously as possible.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of someone who is rightly referred to as the dean of the New York press corps, Alan Emory, Washington bureau chief of the Watertown Daily Times. This Saturday Alan marks his 50th year with the Times, the last 46 have been spent here in Washington. 
But more important than the length of Alan's service is the manner in which he has served his community. He has been a thoughtful, candid, and thoroughly professional reporter who has given the readers of the Watertown Times a clear view of the work of their elected officials in Washington. 
Alan is tough but fair, and his influence extends far beyond Watertown. Never content to just follow the pack, Alan is constantly on the lookout for stories that may not make the network evening news, but which have a real impact on the lives of his readers. 
Born in New York City, Alan was raised on Long Island and educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. A World War II veteran, he arrived in Watertown in July 1947 and was one of three Columbia graduates hired that summer by Harold B. Johnson, the editor and publisher of the Watertown Times. 
Alan's first beats included the Boy Scouts and the local railroad station, but he was soon assigned to cover the city of Massena where he got his day-to-day newspaper training. 
It was also during this time that Alan began covering politics and his impressive work led to his editor assigning him to the St. Lawrence County political beat. 
In October 1948 he was appointed State editor and the following year he was named Albany correspondent. During his time in Albany he met his wife of 47 years, Nancy, and they have two sons, Marc and John, and a daughter, Katharine. 
In 1951, Alan was asked to go to Washington. For 46 years and the administrations of 10 Presidents, Alan has kept his readers informed about what's going on down here and how it affects them. 
Alan has always been an example of the best in professional journalism and he has proudly served as president and director of the Society of Professional Journalists and as president of the Gridiron Club. 
Mr. President, I want to extend congratulations to Alan Emory on 50 years of providing journalistic excellence to the readers of the Watertown Times. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Connie Mack, Kit Bond, and Arlen Specter to introduce a concurrent resolution condemning the Palestinian Authority for the killing of Palestinians for selling land to Israelis. This legislation is being offered concurrently in the House by my colleagues, Congressmen Jon Fox and Jerry Weller. 
Mr. President, we are offering this resolution because it is appalling that Yasir Arafat, to whom we provide millions of dollars in aid, is allowing his so-called police officers from the Palestinian Authority to carry out assassinations of Arab land dealers for their sales of land to Jews. Arafat terms these dealers `isolated traitors' for their actions and has thereby given his approval to these killings. 
Thus far, three land dealers have been killed, execution style with a bullet to the back of the head, all by Palestinian Authority police officers. The Israeli police have already arrested one man in the killing of the first land dealer, Farid Bashiti, and earlier in the week they arrested four Palestinian officers attempting to kidnap another land dealer. According to a story in today's Ha'aretz (a newspaper in Israel) the detained Palestinian police officers have given information that links Tawfik Tirawi, the head of security in Ramallah, under Palestinian Authority control.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the case of Christoph Meili. He is a heroic young Swiss bank guard, 27 years of age, who stumbled on a situation that was rather remarkable. It was the shredding this past January of historical documents at Union Bank of Switzerland, one of Switzerland's largest, most prestigious banks. He noted that these records dated during the period of the Holocaust, prior to and during World War II, and he knew that the Government of Switzerland had just passed legislation prohibiting destruction of just these types of records. He took a handful of these records and brought them to the Jewish Cultural Society. They then passed them on to the police--never went to the media. The records were never copied. They were never in any way compromised. 
For his bravery, for standing up and doing the right thing, he has been fired from his job. In his termination letter, Mr. Meile was told that although his conduct was `classified as ethical and moral in certain circles,' his actions were unjustifiable from the perspective of labor law. 
Can you imagine that. He saw the law being violated. He knew that these documents were of import, and he was fired. Here is a noble young man who risked everything, a humble man, a high school education, with a wife and two children. What happened? He is called a traitor to his country. His wife and children are threatened. Hundreds of letters pour in. 
Let me read one letter, and it is a tough letter. And I have seen many of these: 
Meile, you bastard. The secret numbered account won't do you any good. You are a son of a bitch, a traitor to your country. It will cost you your life. Your children are in danger. We will kidnap them and make sure that you pay the ransom with your Jewish money. We'll finish you off. We're going to wipe out the entire Meile clan. Traitors like you are not wanted. If you have any courage, you'll kill yourself or emigrate into the promised land to your Jewish friends--to Israel or the U.S. You won't live much longer in Switzerland if you don't kill yourself. 
That is the kind of thing he has been subjected to. This brave, courageous and righteous young man finds himself terminated from employment, blacklisted. 
The chairman of the board of Union Bank, Mr. Studer says that he thinks Mr. Meili did this to get money. Now, let me say something. Mr. Meili did not go to the press. This information was released by the Union Bank and the police authorities.

Mr. DAMATO. I did not receive a direct reply, but let me tell you what I did get just yesterday. I received a letter from Mr. Meile's attorney, Marcel Bosonnet. 
In the letter the prosecutor says, basically, that `we intend,' and I quote, `to bring a charge' against Mr. Meili. They are going to charge Mr. Meili with criminal conduct, not the bank which shredded the records. And they want Mr. Meili to come back to Switzerland for another interview. Mr. Meili's lawyer, Mr. Bosonnet, writing to a lawyer who is representing Mr. Meili because Mr. Meili is here in hiding, has advised him not to come back to Switzerland because he would face not only persecution but prosecution and harassment. 
Now, Mr. President, it is one thing for the Swiss Government to say, `Do not blame us for what took place 50 years ago', and another thing to say, `Well, what we are doing today is correct.' I say to the Swiss Government and to the Swiss banks, do not shred the truth. Tell the truth. Mr. Meili should not be facing criminal charges for coming forward. 
Let me share with you, if I might, what I learned just before we adjourned. And, by the way, I commend my colleagues in the Senate for passing the bill which will give to Mr. Meili relief, a private relief bill which will permit him and his family to reside in this country legally and to be able to be gainfully employed. That legislation is now pending action in the House. But let me say to you that I think all of us were moved when we heard the testimony of Mr. Meili. 
I said to him, `Christoph, why did you do this? Why did you take these documents and report and expose what was going on?' 
Do you know what he said? He said, `Two months earlier I saw `Schindler's List,' and I knew that I must be doing something, and I could not just stand by and let this take place.' 
So I say to my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, can we do anything less than to ask for speedy passage of that legislation that will give Christoph the right to work and live here in this great country, to tell him that we do appreciate his standing up for truth and justice, and also to let the Swiss Government know in the strongest terms that we are not going to stand by and do business as usual. We are not going to allow them to harass this young man, because this prosecutor is way off base. If anything, he should be investigating the destruction of those historical documents by the Union Bank, documents that existed in some cases for more than 60 years. Suddenly they say they began to destroy them by accident. I do not believe it. 
It also raises in this Senator's mind the question of how historical documents that have been stored in warehouses belonging to some of the banking institutions mysteriously have caught on fire. I'm talking about four different warehouses in this country, the latest being in New Jersey, concerning documents that belonged to Credit Suisse. 
I wonder how it is that shredding takes place after 60 years by accident. When a young bank guard comes forward and says, `Look, this is not right,' he, then, becomes the victim and becomes the criminal. 
What we seek is justice and a full accounting. And certainly fair treatment of this heroic young man. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on a subject of profound importance for the youth of our Nation and the future economic well-being of our citizens and our country. It is a subject that every single adult in our country must deal with on a day-to-day basis and whose fortune depends on its successful application. And yet, no matter how vital this subject is, we often don't realize what scant energy and resources are devoted to mastering it. What is this subject that is woven throughout our lives, touching everyone but which is frequently ignored? Simply put, it is financial literacy; the ability to manage money. 
Modern American life offers us a world of almost limitless financial possibilities. Marshalling all the knowledge and resources of the modern marketplace, people today are provided with a tremendous variety of choices about how to earn a living, invest for the future, and provide security for their families. The benefits of such financial diversity are obviously great, but only if coupled with the knowledge of how to apply basic economic reasoning. For all too many of our fellow citizens, this knowledge was never imparted to them in all their years of schooling. 
The consequences of such financial ignorance are obvious and extremely costly, not only on a personal level, but also to the country's economy. Extraordinarily high consumer debt, bankruptcy, low savings rates, the inability of many to make sound and reasonable budgets and financial plans--these are the symptoms of a disease that sap our Nation's strength, Mr. President. A disease of financial ignorance and apathy. But fortunately one with a cure, if we just make the effort to teach our children the basic financial management skills we've always assumed that they had. 
Our schools teach reading, writing, history, languages, mathematics, and science, among other subjects. But do we teach our children how to balance a checkbook? Do we instruct them on the beauty of compounding interest, which allows one to save vast amounts of money over the long term for an education, or retirement, or to buy a home? Do we instruct them in avoiding the credit card trap of easy financing, only to be hit later with high finance charges? Do we train students to understand how to budget their money, and do they realize the relationship of taxes, spending, and investing? Too often, Mr. President, we do not. 
The resolution I place before the Senate today recognizes the danger to our Nation's continued economic vitality by its support of an innovative public-private partnership, called the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy. Jump$tart's primary goal is to improve the financial literacy of our children from kindergarten through twelfth grade by strengthening curriculums across the country in their teaching of basic financial management skills, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and borrowing. 
Additionally, Jump$tart puts into place mechanisms to survey high school seniors every other year to monitor the understanding of the students toward financial literacy. With the data provided by the surveys, we will be able to track the progress of schools as they improve their teaching of financial literacy. 
Mr. President, the Jump$tart Coalition will also create a national data base to hold an annotated listing of information in personal finance education. I believe this will be an invaluable clearinghouse of knowledge, giving our teachers and school districts a wide range of teaching materials which they can choose from to suit their particular situation. 
Recognizing how important financial literacy is to the future success of our country, an impressive roster of participating organizations has lined up in support of the Jump$tart Coalition. From the Federal Reserve, to the American Financial Services Association to the Consumer Bankers Association to institutions of higher learning, including one from my home State, the State University of New York (SUNY) at Oneonta; they know the keys to personal success lie with teaching kids financial smarts. The Wall Street Journal has signed on as well, utilizing their innovative Classroom Edition to reach out directly to students, offering instruction in money management. 
Mr. President, on Thursday, May 22, the Jump$tart Coalition will announce the results of a national survey conducted to gage the financial literacy of today's high school seniors. Preliminary results highlight the urgent need for work in this area. The Jump$tart Coalition initiatives are voluntary, but through public awareness and access to curriculum information, I am confident we can make great strides in ending the ignorance. The children of today will be the economic decision makers of tomorrow; they need dollars and sense savvy to make the right decisions for themselves and their families, and with a little extra effort, we can teach them. The Jump$tart Coalition is a worthy effort at teaching our youth the money management skill necessary to prosper in the years to come, and should appeal to members from both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in order to urge the Senate to pass and send to the President, H.R. 1650, a bill to award Mother Teresa a Congressional Gold Medal. 
I would like to take this opportunity to commend our colleague, the honorable Senator from Kansas, Sam Brownback, for his tireless efforts to pass this legislation. Senator Brownback first introduced a Senate version of this legislation, S. 689, earlier this month with overwhelming bipartisan support and cosponsorship. 
That this legislation has moved quickly and easily through both Houses of Congress is a testament not only to Mother Teresa's humanitarian and charitable activities over a lifetime, but also to Senator Brownback's hard work and commitment to honoring this outstanding human being. 
The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress can bestow on someone for acts and dedication to a cause that exceeds even the highest standards. This bill honors Mother Teresa for her lifelong devotion to the sick and the needy in the most impoverished areas of the world. It also recognizes her work to build and sustain the Missionaries of Charities in 25 countries. Under her direction and following her example of selflessness, over 3,000 members of the Missionaries of Charities stand ready to continue her work. 
Mr. President, Mother Teresa has already been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It is time for Congress itself to honor Mother Teresa and I commend Senator Brownback for initiating this legislation. I offer my personal thanks and congratulations to my colleague.

Mr. DAMATO. I will not take a long time. 
Mr. President, let me just simply say this: I support the efforts of my distinguished colleague from Florida. He has been instrumental in helping to lead the way. I remember when we first appropriated money from the defense account for breast cancer research. Were it not for his persuasiveness on the floor, I do not know if we would have ever made that historic breakthrough. That was an amendment offered by Senator Harkin and myself. It was really Senator Mack who made a difference in this presentation with his efforts. 
Let me say this: We are missing the boat. We are just dreadfully missing the boat. Where is our sense of priority in terms of how we do the business of the people? 
I have to tell you something. We should take money from any one of a number of sources to see to it that the NIH is properly funded. What we are doing today--making scavengers and beggars of the best in biomedical research--is just simply wrong, whether it is for AIDS, whether it is pediatric work, cancer research, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Virtually every male in this Chamber is going to get prostate cancer if they live long enough. 
What are we doing to ourselves and to future generations? I suggest that we are mortgaging it by not coming forward and allocating resources. I don't care if it comes from the gasoline tax, the cigarette tax, or from cutting expenditures in other areas. We couldn't invest money more prudently than in this kind of medical research. 
We shouldn't be juggling funds and saying take it from diabetic research and put it into some other area. Every one of these areas under NIH needs more money. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we not only pass this resolution but then do the business of the people, and that we stand up and say, `Yes, we are going to allocate the necessary resources.' There was a 4.3-cent-per-gallon raise in the gas tax to help bring the deficit down. You ask the American people if they wouldn't take one penny of that--which is a lot of money on an annual basis, well over $1 billion--and use that for medical research. You ask them whether or not they would be willing to see to it that expenditures that we are making today should not be diverted to this area. And they would tell you to spend the money for the research so we don't have to go begging and turning down worthy applications because we are talking about the lives of our children and future generations. 
I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues for their patience.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Feinstein, Hatch, Dodd, Abraham, Torricelli, Biden, and Boxer to introduce a bill to provide protection to Christophe and his family so that they may stay in this country and that Christophe may be allowed to work and support his family. 
Christophe Meili is the Swiss bank guard fired after he reported the destruction of Holocaust era bank records at the Union Bank of Switzerland, Zurich branch, on January 8, 1997. He is here along with his wife Guiseppina, and his two children, Miriam and David. 
For his bravery in saving historically important documents from the shredder, Christophe was fired and today is under investigation for violating Swiss bank secrecy laws for disclosing the records, first to the Zurich Jewish Community and then to the Swiss police. He has faced persecution and penalties for a deed that ennobles him in the eyes of the world. Moreover, he and his family have faced hundreds of death threats, including kidnaping threats made against his children. He is truly a man without a country. 
When we held a hearing on his plight in the Banking Committee, he made two remarkable statements. First, when asked why he felt the records he saved were important, he responded, 
`A few months before, I had seen the movie `Schindler's List.' And that's how, when I saw these documents, I realized I must take responsibility; I must do something.' 
When I asked him at the end of the hearing if he had 
anything to add, he said, 
Please protect me in the U.S.A. and in Switzerland. I think I become a great problem in Switzerland. I have a woman, two little children, and no future. I must see what goes on in the next days for me. Please protect me. That is all. 
Mr. President, we owe Christophe Meili this much. He has asked to be protected and it is our duty to do so. We are in the presence of a very good man, a man who has made a difference and will be remembered for generations to come. 
Christophe Meili should be viewed as a hero, not a criminal. His actions in preventing the destruction of evidence are courageous and serve the cause of justice for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust and their families. It is a stain upon the victims' memory that a young man who saved records to help their cause is now being made a victim. It is unfortunate that the chairman of UBS, Robert Studer, has even made remarks questioning the motivation of Christophe for preventing the destruction of these records. 
Moreover, while Christophe and his family have been persecuted for his noble deed, it is a disgrace that the bank's archivist who ordered the shredding at UBS, Erwin Haggenmuller, still has his job. I wrote to Peter Cosandey, the district attorney of Zurich who is investigating this case, and I asked him to end his harassment of Christophe. I also asked him why he is not investigating Erwin Hagenmuller for his role in ordering the shredding of the files. 
Christophe has been unemployed since January and this hardship is taking its toll on this brave young man and his family. Thankfully, Edgar Bronfman has come to the rescue once again by offering Christophe a job. I am sure that this is a comfort to Christophe and his family. 
Christophe Meili's story is one of a man dedicated to seeing that justice is achieved, yet persecuted because he tried to ensure it. His treatment by the security firm that employed him and the bank that wants him prosecuted, is unjust and unfair. 
This is a tragedy. Because he did his job, Christophe Meili was fired. Because he showed courage and integrity, Christophe Meili was fired. And now, they are threatening him with prosecution. The people deserve better. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in granting this hero, this righteous man, the sanctuary that he has requested and that he and his family deserve.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the topic of North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] enlargement and U.S. security. Now that there is agreement on the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation, a significant obstacle to NATO enlargement has been removed. I have said before and say again that NATO enlargement is good for the United States, good for our NATO allies, good for the candidate states, and good for Russia. 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is scheduled to announce at its July 8 and 9 summit meeting in Madrid, Spain, which candidate states will be invited to engage in negotiations leading to accession of these states to the Washington Treaty by 1999. Each of the states that have expressed interest in consideration for accession are participating states in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. 
As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I have led the Commission through a series of hearings on NATO enlargement which we will complete with a final hearing next Tuesday. We have invited official representatives of states to present their own positions to the Commission at these hearings to help meet the Commission's responsibility to the Congress and the American people to oversee implementation of the Helsinki Accords and subsequent Helsinki process documents, with a particular emphasis on human rights and humanitarian affairs. Congress and NATO have both recognized the significance of candidate states' compliance with OSCE principles in various official documents. 
The Commission's approach to this series of hearings is focused on how well these candidate states have implemented OSCE agreements and complied with OSCE principles. Commissioners ask questions relating to other areas of candidate states' policies and conduct that have been identified as critical to acceptance into NATO, but we are not competing with the committees having legislative jurisdiction in these areas, who will examine those issues more thoroughly and with greater expertise. 
Let me make it very clear that I am a supporter of NATO enlargement. I think that, in principle, every candidate state should be included in NATO when they meet the standards for accession. I do not believe that NATO enlargement should end with the Madrid announcement of the states invited to participate in accession negotiations. 
I believe that it is very important that the United States, and our NATO allies, make very clear to those states not invited to join in the first round that the door is not closed, that the process has not ended, and that we and our allies encourage them to press ahead to meet the standards so that they can join when they are ready. 
We must, with our allies, establish a clearly defined process for achieving membership. If we don't, we run the risk of cutting the legs out from under the reform movements just now taking control of some of the Eastern European countries that have failed to reform their political, military, and economic systems fast enough to meet NATO member country standards. These reform governments must be given a clear, strong signal that when they meet the standards, they will be allowed to join. 
We must not create in Eastern Europe a gray zone between NATO and Russia where the old spheres of influence and balance of power politics could give rise to lasting political instability, poverty, and isolation. While I have not yet seen the text of the new Founding Act, according to news reports it does not create a group of second class NATO members whose security guarantees are diluted and undermined. NATO enlargement does not threaten Russia's security. 
An Eastern Europe without NATO could become a black hole of unrest, poverty, ethnic conflict, and extremism of the worst kinds. This would likely attract 
overt and covert Russian intervention in the affairs of the states in this area, pulling Russia into rebuilding its military machine and deploying it westward, and triggering United States and allied reaction. Neither the United States nor Russia want that to happen. 
An eastern Europe without NATO would threaten Russia's security by preventing Russia from changing its thinking about NATO and about European political and economic relations, preventing constructive changes in Russian policy, and delaying or blocking Russia's full integration into the community of nations. 
NATO enlargement is good for Russia. Russian agreement to the Founding Act signals that the Russian foreign policy elite recognizes that fact. Now, Russian energies can focus on driving political and economic reform to a successful conclusion instead of battling NATO enlargement. Russia should be pleased that one of its strategic flanks will be secured by a strong, friendly defensive alliance. 
Russia should take note that the political, economic, military, and foreign policy changes NATO is insisting upon in successful candidate states will build stable, democratic, free market countries that will not themselves engage in aggression against Russia and that will not allow themselves to become participants in some other state's aggressive designs. Russia should want states with these characteristics on its borders. 
The Russian foreign policy elites should climb up in the Kremlin's towers and look hard at the situations on Russia's other borders. Agreement with the Final Act signals some understanding that it is not in Russia's best long term interests to keep eastern Europe unstable and economically backward. After Russia's experiences in Afghanistan and Chechnya, does Russia really think that any threat, much less the main threat, to its independence and territorial integrity comes from NATO? 
Russia's leaders have a question to which they need an answer--when Russia gets into trouble, who can Russia call upon for help? Recent reports of closer relations between Russia and China should not lead to the conclusion that Russia has a friend or an ally in China. 
The only nations Russia can count on for help are the nations with the capacity to help. The only nations with that capacity are the developed nations of the West, the most powerful of whom are NATO members, and Japan. 
For that help to be available, Russia now needs to press ahead with the same agenda of reforms that the NATO candidate states are implementing. It would be far easier to convince the western republics that Russia deserves help when it needs it if Russia is a democratic, rule-of-law state with a free market economy. 
Reportedly under the new Founding Act, Russia does not have a veto over NATO enlargement and no state's candidacy is foreclosed. Russia needs leaders who can discard cold war thinking and stop seeing NATO enlargement as a victory for the West and a defeat for Russia. Boris Yeltsin is such a leader. 
NATO enlargement is good for the United States, good for NATO's current member states, good for the candidate states, and, finally, good for Russia. 
Wednesday's agreement on the Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security Between NATO and the Russian Federation between NATO Secretary General Solana and Russian Foreign Minister Primakov proves that Russia's current leaders are not as opposed in fact as they sounded in rhetoric to NATO enlargement. The agreement reportedly was put before the North Atlantic Council, NATO's highest body, earlier today, and was approved. 
Among other things, it draws Russia into closer collaboration with NATO on matters of mutual concern. The new NATO-Russia Council will give Russia insight into NATO processes and input into NATO consideration of issues without allowing Russia to block measures the alliance agrees must be taken for our mutual security. 
Perhaps the best part of this enlargement process is not the military security guarantees that go with it to successful candidate states, but the leverage that the enlargement process exerts for basic change in each candidate state that will result in better, safer, and more prosperous lives for each of their citizens. The impact of that leverage has been on view during the course of the Commission's hearing process, as ambassadors of candidate states discuss their progress in meeting the standards for membership. 
Even better, there may be the beginning of a halo effect on the surrounding countries. As they see their neighbors moving into closer integration with the West, they are becoming concerned about their own futures. They can see NATO membership being followed by European Union membership for these successful neighbors. They can see them pulling ahead in the competition for foreign investment, trade, and market access, growing in prosperity and stability behind NATO's shield. And they understand that there is no alternate path that they can follow that will get them to the same place any time soon. 
Thus, even those states that are not now candidates for NATO membership are influenced in the direction of political and economic reform by the process of NATO enlargement. This will have a very positive and long-lasting impact on Europe's political stability, prosperity, and freedom, and decrease the chances that the security guarantees we solemnly extend to new NATO members will ever have to be invoked in crisis or in conflict. This, in the end, is a tremendous benefit for the security of the United States. 
I believe that we must be resolute in pursuing our aim of expanding NATO to encompass all candidate states that meet the standards for membership. We must make it clear that the enlargement is a continuing process that will not end with the first group announced at Madrid, and that NATO membership remains open to states as they improve conditions for their people. In the end, this effort will move European security, prosperity, freedom, and human rights ahead more rapidly than any other course of action. 
In closing, I want to briefly say something to those Americans who can trace their roots to those countries now being considered for NATO membership. Thanks in part to the hopes and beliefs that you would not let die even when times were very bad, and to your hard work in the American political system, these countries are free and independent again, something the realists of 10 years ago would have said couldn't happen, and would never happen. Keeping the faith, making sure that the United States never recognized the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union, making sure that we supported Solidarity, sustaining support for Charter 77, keeping the life lines open to the many struggling Helsinki groups, making your voices heard here in Washington, those were key events that helped pave the way to where we are today. Thank you for your efforts and know that the futures of these countries could have been much worse but for your active support for their sovereign independence, and for freedom and human rights for their citizens.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, in 1995, there were over 350,000 victims of rape or sexual assault. The Uniform Crime Reports indicate that means that there is one forcible rape every 5 minutes. The most startling aspect of sex crimes is that they go unreported. There are estimates that only 37 percent of all rapes are reported to the police. 
Victims of rape and sexual assault need a place to turn to and RAINN's national toll-free hotline for survivors of sexual assault reaches them. The hotline provides callers access to counseling 24 hours a day, from anywhere in the country. 
RAINN is an acronym for rape, abuse, and incest national network. When a survivor calls the 800 number, a computer identifies the caller's location by reading the area code and the first three digits of the phone number. The call is routed to the rape crisis center nearest the caller. If the line is busy, the call will be routed to the next closest center. 
RAINN networks with 628 crisis centers across the Nation, responding to victim's immediate needs. Since its inception in 1994, this organization has helped more than 140,000 victims of sexual assault. 
I am bringing attention to the tremendous work of RAINN because at noon today, on May 16, radio stations across the United States will interrupt their regular programming to play a song from a rape survivor, Tori Amos. This is a nationwide call to action--a way to raise public awareness to what is happening to those victimized by rapists. 
I am proud to be an honorary co-chair of RAINN and commend all those involved in working on this national hotline, one of the most valuable resources for the survivor of rape or sexual abuse. 
RAINN was founded in July 1994 with grants from the Atlantic Group and Warner Music Group. Support is also provided by Westwood One, MCI, the Jacobs Family Foundation, the Ryka Rose Foundation, and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call for the release of Wei Jingsheng who has been imprisoned for almost 18 years under the harshest of circumstances in China. Mr. Wei was first jailed in 1979 for advocating democratic reform in China. Can you imagine? The free exchange of such ideas which we take for granted every day in the United States cost Mr. Wei his freedom. 
Mr. Wei was released in 1993 in an act which curiously coincided with an upcoming vote by the International Olympic Committee on China's application to host the Olympic games in the year 2000. China's bid for the Olympic games was unsuccessful and shortly thereafter Mr. Wei was imprisoned again. He is not scheduled for release until 2009. This overtly politically motivated move is unconscionable. 
Through these years of personal terror Mr. Wei has frequently been held in solitary confinement. He was been the victim of cruelty and mistreatment which had a serious effect on Mr. Wei's health. I am told that Mr. Wei is suffering from heart disease but does not have access to proper medical care. This treatment is simply wrong. 
The People's Republic of China wants to assume the status of a responsible nation in the world community. And yet they continue to subjugate the people of Tibet. As a case in point, I spoke earlier this year on the floor about Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College and a friend of the United States, who is serving an 18-year prison term for supposed espionage activities. 
The People's Republic of China wants to assume the status of a responsible nation in the world community. And yet they continue to subjugate their own people as well. Mr. Wei is a case in point. The State Department in its annual human rights record for 1996 hit the nail on the head. It said that China `continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms.' 
Mr. President, Mr. Wei has suffered enough. The people of Tibet have suffered enough. The people of China have suffered enough. It is time for a change. We must work for that change in areas we can influence. And let's start by calling for the release of Mr. Wei.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will extend the Small Business Administration Defense Loan and Technical Assistance [DELTA] Loan Program. There are many areas in the country still in the process of trying to transition from defense into commercial product lines. The proposed legislation would extend the program to September 30, 1999, and broadens the eligibility to include companies that derived at least 25 percent of its sales from defense-related contracts in any 1 of 7 prior years and increases the loan guarantee to 90 percent. Since the funds have already been appropriated no additional funds are required. 
Presently under the current DELTA Program, a company must have 25 percent of its sales coming from defense contracts in the prior year and guarantees 75 percent of the loan. The current DELTA Program has a sunset clause which goes into effect at the end of fiscal year 1998. 
Without this legislation, the DELTA Program expires before companies have been given ample opportunity to make this very difficult transition. We have an obligation to provide extended support for small businesses in areas that have been hard hit by defense downsizing. 
If the DELTA Program is allowed to expire, all the undedicated monies would revert back to the General Treasury. Of the $30 million appropriated, only slightly more than $3 million has been utilized. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, pursuant to the order, I rise today to speak to the release of the report, and I will show you this report. The report is entitled, and I think the title is important, `U.S. and Allied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold Stolen by Germany During World War II.' I think that description of the report is totally inadequate. It is a great report. The author and the person who has worked so hard, Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce and soon to be Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs in the State Department, should be proud. We should all commend him for his efforts at getting the truth. 
What this report might better be called is the report on the greatest robbery that mankind has seen take place under the guise of the law and under the guise of civilized conventions and under and with the approval of allies who did not face the killing machine of the German Nazi armies. This was after the war that the greatest looting continued and this conspiracy continued for 50-plus years. 
Let me say we owe a great debt of gratitude to Stuart Eizenstat because he comes forward with the truth--not all of it, because not all of the documents and not all of the evidence are available or have been made available, but it is a beginning. His dedication to the truth and the perseverance he has demonstrated, and those who work with him, to bring us to this point should be commended. He has done this despite opposition from many quarters, quarters within our own Government, the State Department. The State Department was not happy; they were not happy campers. He pushed forward and he saw to it that this report was released. It really cracks the conspiracy, the veil of secrecy that has existed for 50-plus years. It begins to unravel the web and the deception that has been continued for 50 years, the so-called neutrality of some nations, and particularly the Swiss. 
Simply put, this report details the greatest robbery in the history of mankind. It underscores the necessity for a complete review and release of all of the documents and a full accounting of the assets that the Swiss held during the war and continued to hold for the past 50 years. It is outrageous that this crime could continue and that there were nations and citizens and representatives of this country, as well as our allies, as well as the French, as well as the English, who countenanced this. There were no great German armies threatening them at that point in time. The Swiss cannot claim that they were fearful because they were surrounded and they were a tiny little nation. 
The report demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt the guilt and complicity of the Swiss Government as the bankers for the Nazis during World War II. Holocaust victims and their families have to shudder when they read this report. It leaves the unmistakable conclusion that we have to look carefully and ask our allies to look with us at whether or not we should reopen the Washington accords. The Washington accords set the basis for the distribution of billions and billions of dollars worth of gold. 
Literally, let me say that it would appear that the Swiss Government withheld billions. I will get into some detail and indicate how much. It is very clear that the Swiss Government was not forthcoming, that they were deceptive in terms of how much in the way of assets they were holding, that the Nazi killing machine had deposited with them. They kept these billions of dollars illegally and improperly, notwithstanding the bonafideness they might claim as a result of the accords being agreed to by the Allies. 
Some of this money, unmistakably, came from the death camps, places like Auschwitz and Treblinka, as well as from the peoples throughout Europe who were slaughtered when the Nazi killing machine swept across the Continent. In the 1946 accords between the Allies and Switzerland, the Swiss Government only agreed to give the Allies $58 million in gold. That would be the equivalent of about $580 million today, despite the fact that even some of our negotiators knew they had at least $398 million, or worth close to $4 billion today. So, while they had $4 billion that never belonged to them, they distributed and agreed to distribute a small portion of that. They basically said, `We have it, we are not telling you how much, and this is how much we are going to give you.' 
The report indicates that the Swiss refused to give the Allies any more than $28 million in what we call German external assets. Those are the assets that are stocks and bonds and insurance policies, real estate, and others. Despite the fact that we knew that they had the equivalent of between $4 and $8 billion, they said, `We will give the equivalent of less than $300 million.' 
There is a movie that has become somewhat famous called `Jerry Maguire.' In that, the athlete, I think the movie star Cuba Gooding Jr., has a great line when he says, `Show me the money.' Well, Mr. President, it is about time we said to the Swiss, `Show us the money,' give to the world a full and proper accounting, reopen those accords. 
There was a claim by the Swiss Ambassador the other day 
saying, `You cannot hold us responsible for what took place 50 years ago.' To that extent I can say, that is correct. Most of the individuals today in Government or in positions of responsibility were nowhere around then. They did not make those decisions. They did not make the decisions relating to trafficking with the Nazis, being their bankers, or, indeed, keeping the loot thereafter and refusing to meet their legitimate obligations. But we can hold them accountable now. We can and we must. 
There are going to be great pressures to say, `Come on, stop rocking the boat.' There are tremendous international consequences in terms of the international corporations that these banks do business with and/or control and/or work with. These billions of dollars that they have had and have used all these years at their disposal, they are not so anxious to depart with them. Indeed, if one were to say, `Give us a real accounting, show us all of the money, the money and profits that were made as a result of the billions of dollars that you have kept over the years,' wouldn't that be interesting. 
The question as to where did all of that money go becomes important. Who concealed it for all these years? Why did it take a righteous man like Christophe Meili, a young bank guard, to stop the records of these transactions from being shredded? He attempted to. He is a young bank guard who stumbled upon Union Bank of Switzerland shredding records 5 months ago. Should we say anyone who is alive today is responsible for what took place 50 years ago when they were not there? We can certainly say, why would you shred records now, records that related to great companies and corporations and the business activities that they had with the Germans, records that, it would seem, indicated that there were properties of Jews that were forced to leave, forced sales? Why would the bank historian do this, and what was the fate of this particular young man? 
This week we heard testimony from Mr. Meili, who, as a result of turning over some documents to the Jewish Historical Society, who then turned them over to the Swiss police, has come under tremendous pressure. Instead of being held as a righteous person and a man who did what was correct, he has received hundreds of death threats, in writing--not just by way of the telephone. His children have been the subject of harassment, and they are 2 and 4 years old. He has been threatened and the lives of his children--it has been indicated they would be kidnapped in retaliation for his act of courage. Here is a young man who acted as a righteous person, and instead of beinging treated as a hero for standing up and doing what is right, he has been treated like a criminal. 
Yes, the Swiss Government and their Ambassador has said, `Do not judge us on the events that occurred 50 years ago but on what we do today.' Certainly, if the treatment of Mr. Meili is any indication of their commitment to finding truth, then it makes it rather difficult to hold out hope that they are really dedicated to attempting to deal with the horrors that took place and have been concealed for 50 years. 
The Swiss bankers owe the world a total and full accounting, as do our allies. It is about time that our allies and this Government put aside the diplomatic niceties and do what they should have done 50 years ago and do the right thing. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that there are going to be great pressures to put this aside. I think what is taking place is unconscionable, and it is time to set the record straight. 
Because of the importance of the report of Mr. Eizenstat, as well as the great work of Mr. Slany, the historian of the State Department, we will be holding Banking Committee hearings on Thursday, May 15. We will hear from Ambassador Eizenstat, and Mr. Slany, the State Department historian. They will discuss the findings of the report, what it covers, what it doesn't cover. We will also hear from Ambassador Borer, of the Swiss Foreign Ministry; he is their special ambassador. Finally, we will hear from Tom Bower, author of the book `Nazi Gold,' which traces the history of the Swiss banks during World War II, and Rabbi Marvin Hier, of the Simon Weisenthal Center in Los Angeles. Rabbi Hier has played a major role in tracing the flow of assets of Europe to South America during this period. 
Mr. President, the world deserves the truth. For 50 years, it has been hidden in the archives while justice has been denied to the victims of the Holocaust and the survivors. This is the greatest tragedy, a tragedy of indifference, a tragedy of the indifference of the Swiss bankers and it is disgraceful. They knew they were accepting laundered gold and that they were financing the Nazi war machine. As Secretary Eizenstat said, the Swiss bankers extended the war. How many people died because of this? We don't know. We may never know the answer. But it is our duty to get the facts and have a full accounting from the bankers. 
During these `Days of Remembrance' of the Holocaust, it is our duty to go forward to try to achieve some measure of justice for those who cannot fight for themselves. In memory of those who died in the Holocaust, and the people who still act courageously, like Christophe Meili, we must continue the inquiry so that the full truth be known. 
This past Tuesday, Mr. President, Mr. Meili came before the Banking Committee. His testimony was chilling, to say the least. As we reached the end, I asked him several questions. I turn to page 40 of the transcript. Mr. President, let me say that this was not a Q and A in which the questions were known to the person who was being asked, nor did I have any idea or know how Mr. Meili--the 28-year-old bank guard who came from Switzerland this past Friday, and is in this country now--would respond. I said:  
Let me, if I might, just ask several other questions, and then put some letters . . . into the record. 
And I turned to him and I said: 
What made you, Christophe, think that the records you found were important and should be saved from destruction? 
Through his interpreter, Mr. Meili said this: 
A few months before, I had seen the movie `Schindler's List.' And that's how, when I saw these documents, I realized I must take responsibility; I must do something. 
He is a 28-year-old bank guard in Switzerland. He did something that was right, that was courageous. He is a non-Jew, but he had seen `Schindler's List' and he was moved, he was compelled to respond, to stop the shredding of these documents or the destruction, to report them to someone, and to say should this be done? 
And then, Mr. President, if that wasn't chilling enough--and, really, it seems to me a call for those of us who have the power and the responsibility of righting these wrongs--I asked him if there were any closing remarks he would like to make, that we would be glad to receive them. I asked that question of the three witnesses who appeared before us. Here is what Mr. Meili said: 
Please protect me in the United States and in Switzerland. I think I become a great problem in Switzerland. I have a woman, two little children, and no future. I must see what goes on in the next days for me. Please protect me. That is all. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Mr. President, it is not good enough for the Swiss Ambassador to say, `You can't hold us responsible for what took place 50 years ago,' when a young man who has attempted to do what is right finds himself ostracized, finds the power of the Swiss Government and the Swiss banks--who indeed run the Swiss Government, as a practical matter--and that remark may draw their ire and their fire and their protest, that a young man who acted courageously now finds himself a victim scorned, the lives of his wife and children threatened. How can we do any less than what one individual, Christophe Meili, attempted to do, and that is to do what is right? 
So, Mr. President, I hope that this week when we have these hearings, this will be a new beginning and it will energize our Government and our allies to come forward in a united way, to put aside the diplomatic niceties that have shrouded this over the years, to seek a full accounting and to seek justice once 
and for all. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address a scourge that has long afflicted the State of New York and many parts of the Northeast. That scourge is acid rain. 
Ending the scourge of acid rain will not be easy. In fact, it is likely that additional congressional efforts will be necessary to fully address this issue and I intend to continue to work on such efforts. However, I believe that it is necessary to introduce this legislation at this time to make the Senate aware that serious measures must be taken to solve the acid rain problem that continues to impact New York and the Northeast. I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop the most sensible and cost-effective approach to eliminate the damages of acid rain. 
Over the past 15 years, Congress and the Federal Government have attempted to address this problem. Unfortunately, efforts to date have not yielded the success in may State that New Yorkers had wished. Lakes, streams, and trees in the Adirondacks are still dying due to sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions that are transported from upwind sources. The health of New Yorkers and New York's environment continue to be affected by fuel burning activities in other regions of our Nation. That must change. This bill will see that significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are achieved so that New Yorkers and also others in the Northeast will be able to enjoy a cleaner environment. 
Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide [SO2] and nitrogen oxides [NOx]--created from the burning of fossil fuels--react with water vapor in the atmosphere to create dilute amounts of sulfuric and nitric acid. These acids then fall to Earth either through precipitation or as gases and dry particles--dry deposition. Congress first passed legislation to address acid rain in the 1982 Clean Air Act amendments. It soon became clear, though, that the provisions would not effectively curb acid rain. The New York State Legislature in 1984 recognized this problem and enacted programs leading to specific reductions of in-State acid rain sources. The success of those efforts have produced a 40-percent reduction to date of in-State emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. 
New York's efforts notwithstanding, only a small amount of the acid rain that impacts New York State actually originates in New York State. To truly protect New York's environment, it was necessary for facilities in other parts of our Nation to reduce their emissions. Partly as a result of New York's efforts, Congress included title IV in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments to require a 50-percent decrease nationwide in sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 2000. Because of the requirements of title IV, significant reductions in sulfur dioxide have occurred already. Nevertheless, these reductions are not enough to fully protect the Adirondacks, nor will they reverse the damage that has been done. To do this, further decreases in sulfur dioxide emissions will be necessary. 
Even with all the many efforts to date and those that need to be achieved in the future, reductions in sulfur dioxide alone will not be sufficient to protect New York's environment from continued acid deposition. Other pollutants, mainly nitrogen oxides [NOx], have also been shown to play a significant role in the acidification of our waters and forests. Without further controls of nitrogen oxides, the EPA estimates that the number of acidic lakes in the Adirondacks will increase to 43 percent by the year 2040. Such an increase will see approximately 1,300 lakes out of the 3,000 in the Adirondacks become chronically acidic. This is not the kind of legacy that we should pass along to future generations. 
Even with the controls that the Clean Air Act of 1990 imposed, more must be done if the Adirondacks are to be spared further acidification. This legislation will require the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to promulgate regulations to reduce utility emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by two-thirds from 1990 levels. This legislation targets those areas of the Nation that are the primary contributors of these pollutants. Such reductions will produce dramatic decreases in 
acid deposition in New York and throughout the Northeast, as well as decreases in the level of fine particulates, ozone and haze. 
The bill would also expand the membership of the existing Ozone Transport Commission from the current 12 States to include additional States that have been shown to contribute to the long-range transport of ozone and acid rain. The Ozone Transport Commission is authorized under the Clean Air Act to make recommendations for pollution controls to be enacted by member States. The EPA can either approve or disapprove any recommendations. However, the EPA would have to provide equivalent alternatives in those cases where it disapproves the recommendations. 
Once enacted, this bill would require those States that contribute to acid rain pollution to implement control measures like those currently in place in New York and the Northeast. These include activities like scrubbers on smokestacks, low NOx burners, and the use of low-sulfur coal, although the bill would not mandate which technology to use. 
For some time now, New York has played by the rules and has gone the extra mile to reduce the emissions that cause acid rain within her borders. While I recognize that the reductions associated with title IV of the Clean Air Act will move us in the right direction, no amount of effort on the part of New York or other similarly afflicted States in the Northeast can be effective if other parts of our Nation do not do their fair share. Enough is enough. I only ask for equity from our neighbors so that New York may be able to enjoy a cleaner environment and the resulting health benefits. It can be done.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my father, Mr. Armand D'Amato, Sr. of Island Park, NY. He is being honored on May 8, 1997 for his role as the founder of the Island Park Chamber of Commerce, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month. I would like to take this opportunity to commend my father for his lifelong commitment to making his community a richer, more prosperous and safer place to live. 
One of Armand D'Amato's most im-portant and lasting contributions to his community was the founding of the Island Park Chamber of Commerce in 1947. The chamber was, and remains today, a vital tool in developing the economic potential of Island Park. As a small businessman and the first president of the chamber of commerce, serving in that position for 9 years, dad recognized that economic prosperity should not be taken for granted and that only through vigilance and hard work is a community's economic well-being safeguarded. 
Armand D'Amato was born in Newark, NJ, the second of nine children born to Italian immigrants who traveled to America from Avalino, Italy while still teenagers. As a child, he rarely heard English spoken in his home. It was not until he attended elementary school at the age of 5 that he began to learn English. At a time when Italian immigrants in America were subjected to unfair discrimination, the obstacles dad encountered as a child taught him valuable lessons about the realities and hardships of life, and instilled in him a determination to succeed. 
After earning his bachelor's degree from Montclair State Teachers College and his master's from New York University, Dad served his country overseas during World War II. He and my mother, Antoinette, settled in Island Park in 1945. Since that time, he has been energetically involved in the public life of Island Park. 
Armand D'Amato's dedication to his community did not stop with the founding of the Island Park Chamber of Commerce. He was also instrumental in founding the American Alliance to Combat Crime and Violence, an organization sponsored by the Island Park Chamber of Commerce dedicated to making Island Park a safer place to live and raise a family. He also founded the Island Park Taxpayer Association in 1953, the Tri-Community Council of Island Park in 1954 and served as district governor of the Nassau County Lion's Club in 1963. 
During the 1970's and 1980's, dad served as director of business research at the nassau County Department of Commerce and Industry and organized the Business Resource Center at Nassau Community College. 
My father's vigorous commitment to public service and the values he has instilled in his family are reflected by the career paths chosen by his two sons. My brother, Armand D'Amato, Jr., served in the New York State Assembly for fourteen years. And my own career in public service was certainly inspired by his active involvement in the community. 
Armand D'Amato has worked his entire life to make Island Park a better place to live. His dedication and commitment to the concept of community service has had an immeasurable impact on the lives of the citizens of Island Park. My father personifies the spirit of community leadership to which others should aspire, and I am proud to join in honoring him.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, make no mistake about it, I support the provisions that have broken the chain of welfare dependency, welfare that became a narcotic, and it trapped people. I think that our reform of the welfare system was good, intended and long overdue. 
However, there have been some unintended consequences that are devastating. I do not believe we ever wanted to take 500,000 basically senior citizens and say that `you're going to be cut off,' senior citizens who are here in this country legally, receiving SSI benefits, who abided by the rules, and now simply terminate them. 
Let me give you a profile of these legal immigrants who received their notice of termination. Seventy-two percent of them are women. They are over the age of 65. Forty-one percent of them are over the age of 75. And almost 20 percent, or close to 100,000, are over the age of 85. 
Are we really going to say that we are going to take close to these senior citizens, the vast bulk of them women, who have infirmities, who have problems with the language, and say, `Come August 22, you are off the roll notwithstanding that you came here legally, notwithstanding that you met all of the requirements'? 
What our amendment does is simply say we are giving, to October 1, the continuation of assistance. And, hopefully, many of these people who have these infirmities will be able to qualify as citizens. It will give us additional time to deal with what otherwise would be a catastrophe for many of these people. 
Mr. President, young, able-bodied recipients should be required to report to a job. They should be challenged. There should not be an automatic pass to welfare assistance. But certainly not the aged, the infirmed, those who need help. 
We are a country of compassion. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which is sensible.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am just going to be a few seconds. Twenty-five years ago, a young man came to the Senate. He, indeed, has enriched the Senate with his leadership, with his integrity, and with his very presence. The fact of the matter is, he is the son of Italian immigrants and comes from the great State of New Mexico. It is Senator Pete Domenici's 65th birthday. Senator Domenici, happy birthday.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Chafee, Senator DeWine, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Specter, I call up this amendment because, notwithstanding the attempt--and I appreciate it--by the Appropriations Committee initially to deal with a very vexing problem, the problem of immigrants and the problem of legal immigrants and the problem really dealing with legal immigrants, most of whom are, a good percentage are disabled and who are elderly who would otherwise be cut off August 22, notwithstanding that they came into the country legally, that they are currently receiving benefits, that if these benefits were to be cut off in some States, they would be faced with little, if any, help. 
In other States, the burden would be a tremendous one on some of the local municipalities and the States. This amendment would continue the existing funding of those legal immigrants--let's understand, we are talking about people who came into this country legally; we are talking about people who obeyed the law; we are talking about, for most cases, senior citizens, elderly, and disabled--to continue their SSI benefits. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that this is a prudent way in which to handle what could otherwise be a very disastrous problem for 500,000 people, most of whom are elderly, in this country. That is a half-million people. That is a lot of people who would be facing tremendous hardship, many who have no one in a position to be of any kind of assistance. For others, without their SSI payments and cut off from food stamps, their families would be in perilous situations even attempting to give them modest help. 
Let me say that I am deeply appreciative of the leadership that has been displayed by the Senate majority leader, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and our distinguished colleague from West Virginia, in attempting to deal with this problem in a way that will give us additional time. 
Again, we are not talking about people who came into this country illegally, people who are trying to take advantage of the system. We are taking an opportunity to give the Congress of the United States and the President sufficient time to work out a program that will see to it that the system is not abused but, by the same token, see to it that people are not disadvantaged as a result of the significant work of the Congress in bringing about workfare as opposed to welfare. 
Let me say what the situation is in terms of New York. In New York, we are talking about 80,000 legal immigrants who now would be facing termination of benefits--80,000. Again, Mr. President, the vast number who are senior citizens, many of them have tremendous language barriers, many of them have been in this country for a number of years, some not long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits, all of them here legally. Mr. President, 70,000 of these people are in the city of New York. 
What an incredible impact that would be to the city, to the State, and to other communities. As I look around, I see my colleagues from California, who have the same kind of problem. I see my colleague from Rhode Island. It is a tremendous problem that would be created. That was never our intent in terms of reforming the welfare system. Ours was to create an opportunity for workfare, not a system that entraps people. Ours says to those who are capable of going out and holding a job or getting into a job training program that you just cannot take advantage of the system. But I do not believe it was one in which we envisioned just cutting off those people who cannot do for themselves. We are a compassionate country. We are a country which is ready and recognizes the need to help those citizens who cannot do for themselves. 
So, let me say this. The Social Security Administration estimates that SSI recipients who received notices of possible termination of benefits are made up of--let me just give you an idea who these half a million people are: 72 percent are women; 41 percent are over the age of 75; 18 percent are over the age of 85. 
Are we going to say to those people, 18 percent over the age of 85, `go out and get a job'? What are we going to do?

Mr. DAMATO. That is correct. What we are doing is providing the Congress, as well as these people, an additional 6 weeks from August 22. A good number of these people during this period of time will be qualified as citizens, understanding, if you look at the age category of them, many of these people are elderly, there was never an impetus. It is very difficult. They have language barriers, disabilities, problems in communication and transportation. The immigration offices are swamped with those people who are attempting and who are eligible for citizenship. 
When you look at this, if close to 20 percent are over 85, we are talking about almost 100,000, and most of them women, who are over the age of 85, who may have disabilities, who may have language problems just trying to qualify them for citizenship. In some cases, they will not have to take the ordinary test. But how do we get them that information? How do we get them there in time? It cannot be done between now and August 22. New York City Mayor Giuliani is engaged in an outreach program to contact many of these elderly immigrants and give them an opportunity to qualify for full citizenship; therefore, they would not have to be concerned with the cut off in benefits. 
So for all of those reasons, this additional time will also give us and our colleagues an opportunity--as well as the administration--to examine what the program will be in the fullness of time after October 1.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me simply say, I am just going to look at one statistic again and put it in terms of not just saying 18 percent of all of those are over the age of 85. We are talking about 90,000 people, seniors--90,000. Many of them, again, are disabled. Many of them have problems with the language. All of them are here in this country legally. Let us understand that. Let us understand that three-quarters of those people, better than 65,000, are women. 
Are we really going to say to grandmothers, grandparents, to the elderly, to the frailest of the frail, `No more will we meet even your minimum needs'? That is not what this country is about. That is certainly not what I intended nor do I think any Members intended when we voted for the reform of the welfare system. I voted for that. I think we did the right thing. 
I think we can make this bill a much better bill by not only continuing this program now, but then we will argue, and it will give us an opportunity for those to come forward and have a fuller discourse in the future. But certainly, certainly, we should not terminate it now. 
Again, I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their understanding and their support of this legislative correction. It is a correction. It is one. And there is nothing wrong with saying we can do it better, we erred at this point in time. I did. 
Let me tell you, I was concerned that there were many people who were taking advantage of the system. There were those who said and pledged, `Yeah. We'll take care of our elderly, our relatives,' and instead of doing that, they gamed the system and put them right into SSI. Well, that is wrong. We should see to it that that does not take place. But for us now to say, with one fell swoop all of them will be disadvantaged who are presently receiving, that is something that I would not in good conscience support. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by Senator Grams and Senator Johnson. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. 
 Mr. President, the Congress is moving swiftly to provide emergency assistance to the victims of the winter flooding in Minnesota, and North and South Dakota. The Supplemental is an appropriate and compassionate response by the administration and the Congress to the suffering of our fellow citizens. 
Mr. President, this amendment addresses some of the important regulatory steps that can be taken to expedite overall efforts by communities, families, homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to recover from the devastation of the floods. This amendment would authorize the Federal financial regulators to make temporary exceptions to various Federal laws in order to maximize the availability of credit in these flood afflicted areas and expedite its delivery. The amendment will complement measures already instituted by some of the regulators to deal with financial stress in the flooded area. For example, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it may be appropriate for lenders to ease credit terms and restructure debts in certain cases. It is similar to legislation approved by Congress in 1992 and 1993. 
 Mr. President, I commend Senator Grams and Senator Johnson for developing this amendment and urge support for this helpful addition to overall flood relief efforts.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will provide a new tax incentive for qualifying owners of national historic landmark houses that will encourage the preservation and public accessibility to these houses. It is designed to prevent private owners of historical properties from being forced to sell because of concern over the financial burden of Federal estate taxes. 
Under current law, the value of historical property is included in determining the taxable estate of a decedent. This raises serious concerns to families that are maintaining and opening to the public these architectural historical homes. They are sharing these treasures with our Nation. To force the operation of these privately funded museum properties to end, due to fear over future estate tax burdens that will be thrust on their descendants is depriving our citizens the opportunity to enjoy the architectural wonders of these homes. Tourists in many States will be denied the opportunity to visit these homes and experience the heritage of these historical sites. 
Mr. President, I propose that an estate tax exemption be provided for qualified historical properties. The number of historical homes that will qualify is modest since this legislation requires private, taxable ownership and national historical landmark status, as well as a willingness on the part of the owner to operate the premises as a museum subject to strict requirements. While the legislation has minimal effects on Federal revenues it plays a major role in preserving extraordinarily important properties. 
This bill is an opportunity for the Government to encourage preservation of history. Historical homes help preserve the themes of our common heritage and highlight the unique pattern of each community. They contribute to the perpetuation of the historical fabric of our national life. They are a source of a community's pride in accomplishment and beauty. 
Section 1(b)(7) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 states that: 
Although the major burdens of historic preservation have been borne and major efforts initiated by private agencies and individuals, and both should continue to play a vital role, it is nevertheless necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to accelerate its historic preservation programs and activities to get maximum encouragement to agencies and individuals undertaking preservation by private means, and to assist State and local governments and the National Trust Historic Preservation in the United States to expand and accelerate their historical preservation programs and activities. 
That is what this legislation does. It encourages private citizens to preserve historical properties rather than sell or develop them despite their desire to do so. Winston Churchill recognized the importance of preserving historical properties when in 1943 he said `We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us'. 
Mr President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the bill be placed in the Record.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, when the Banking Committee began the inquiry into Swiss banks, we had no idea where the trail would lead. We know that the Nazis had looted personal belongings of millions from all over Europe--gold, personal matters, bank accounts. But we really did not know how much help--I say `help'--that the Nazis had in disposing of this loot. We are beginning to get some idea. Now we have a better idea. 
We know that Swiss banks facilitated the looting of gold from all over Europe. We know that the accounts of great numbers of Holocaust victims were never returned by Swiss banks to their heirs. But we also know that our Nation had similar problems. Other nations had similar problems and participated. France was one of them. 
I am shocked to see a December 1995 report which I am holding here from the French Ministry of Justice. 
Mr. President, this report details an audit of some of France's most prestigious museums and explains how these museums for over 50 years managed to hide their ownership of almost 2,000 works of art--1,955 works of art, to be precise, art that was looted from the victims of the Holocaust and deposited with these museums during the war, some of them sold on the so-called black market by the Nazis, who stripped Europe, who stripped individuals as they came through with their killing machine and sold the art or deposited it with these museums that knew they were not the true owners who were selling it to them. 
Curator after curator cared more about the so-called, to use their words, sanctity of their collections, the museum's collections than for justice of the family from which art work was stolen. This is unconscionable for the museum to be saying, and I quote the museum in Versailles, the curator said, `Each and every one of these works has its proper place in our collections.' Do not disturb them. It does not matter that they were stolen. It does not matter that it was their property. 
The report also quotes a curator from the Musee d'Orsay as having said that a painting held in his collection by Gustave Courbet, the great painting of the Cliffs at Etretat After a Storm--and here is a photograph of that painting; it is one of the great masterpieces of the world--is one of the masterpieces that we would have to buy at a great price if we did not already have it. 
Well, they may have it, but who does it rightfully belong to? Are we saying that the great art museums of the world, and particularly in France, have a right to keep this stolen art work? 
Mr. President, this painting sits today in the Musee d'Orsay and the simple matter is that it does not belong to that museum. This painting, along with thousands of others and with other art objects in the French museums, should be immediately turned over to an independent authority to quickly establish its rightful ownership. The French Government has established a commission to study the problem but the true owners should not have to put up with the delays that go along with commissions like this. It has been 50 years, as the report states. The French museums have made little or no attempt to find either the heirs or the owners of these art works. These works have appeared in exhibits numerous times, have been in possession of the most prominent art museums in the world. The process of returning these works of art must be put in the hands of a party that can search for true owners and do so without a worry whether or not they fit neatly into museum collections. After more than 50 years, it is time for justice. And just as we seek that proper accounting from the Swiss bankers, it is time that French museums do the same.

Mr. DAMATO. My office has been in touch with the French Embassy and has been assured of their cooperation repeatedly. I told them I was going to come to the floor today. We called them. We were assured by the Ambassador's secretary, oh, yes, we are going to get you this information. 
This is not a great secret. This Justice Ministry report again goes back to 1995. The quotes that I have given you come from this report in terms of the attitude of the museums. 
So whether it is `Cliffs at Etretat' or whatever artwork it is that has been stolen and taken illegally, it is time now for a proper accounting. That is what we seek. We will continue to pursue this matter. I hope that the French Ambassador and the French Government would begin to work with us in accommodating justice.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, yesterday I received a very important and a very encouraging letter from Ambassador Thomas Borer. Ambassador Borer is the special representative that the Swiss have appointed to handle the very perplexing and very troublesome question as it relates to the assets of Holocaust victims during and after World War II, particularly those as they related to the accounts that were opened in Swiss banks. 
Let me read this letter. It is a short one, but a very important one. It is from the Embassy of Switzerland, addressed to Senator D'Amato as chairman of the Banking Committee, Washington, DC: 
Dear Mr. Chairman: I am referring to your letter of March 20, 1997 and my reply of March 27, 1997 regarding the question of publishing the names of dormant account holders from the Holocaust era. 
Please find enclosed [a] copy of the letter of the Chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association to the Chairman of the Swiss Federal Banking Commission dated April 28, 1997. In this letter the SBA expresses its unequivocal support for this idea. 
I am going to place this letter in the Record.

<TEXT>
Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me tell you what this is about. I did write to Ambassador Borer. I spoke to him on March 20. And I indicated to the Ambassador that I thought that it was awfully important that the Swiss Bankers Association, that the Swiss Government do something to demonstrate tangibly an effort of good faith, that would be very important, that there are many accounts--we do not know exactly how many; but certainly they go into the hundreds, and they may go into more--that have been dormant since 1945, that it made little sense to wait years until the Swiss completed their investigation for the release of these names, that even if it took legislation--and I explained to him that it had been advised to me that there was a good possibility that it might not even take legislation--that the names of these accounts--those are dormant accounts that were opened prior to 1945 and that have been dormant since that point in time --that the need for secrecy certainly no longer existed, but that there was a need to connect the families and the heirs today who might have claim to those accounts, to their heirs, to their families. 
It is not just a question of money. It is a question of doing what is right, because unfortunately for 50-plus years people have been denied, heirs have been denied. They have had to go through a tortuous process, that in many cases it is just impossible to ascertain what moneys may or may not have been left to them, and that by the publication of the names in some registry, in some total form--something that is being done in many countries, in many States in our country where there is a dormant account, the names of the people are actually published so that people who may have claims can come forth. 
I wrote to him, and I will just quote you part. 
I am writing to you to impress upon you the need for the passage of legislation which would allow for the publication of names of dormant accounts presently held in Swiss banks. I feel that this change would go a long way towards solving this enormously difficult and complicated problem and would equally be seen as a productive step which I am sure would be warmly received. 
I am pleased to tell you that the Ambassador reported to me yesterday, yesterday morning, that the Swiss Bankers Association unequivocally supports the concept of public disclosure of the names of the account holders in this very special and limited situation of the dormant accounts now being investigated as it relates to the Holocaust and those dormant assets. 
I believe, Mr. President, that this is important.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, the chairman of the Swiss Bankers Association in his letter stated: 
I am writing to express the SBA's unequivocal support for the concept of public disclosure of the names of account holders in the very special and limited circumstances presented by Holocaust-related dormant assets. 
This announcement is a major breakthrough because, for the first time, the Swiss bankers will be providing account names on a timely basis. We will not have to wait for the completion of the Volcker Commission and its report. That investigation may take a period of years to be completed. Why should the heirs and those people be deprived of a much more expeditious manner to come forward and to establish the right to those accounts? 
It is about time this has taken place because this question is one that has existed for over 50 years. I am pleased that we are making progress. I look forward to continuing in the efforts of attempting to see that justice is done, not only as it relates to the dormant accounts, but also on the question of the disposition of other assets and also in terms of the accountability of assets, of huge amounts of gold and other matters that were, I believe, surreptitiously and illegally transferred by the Nazis with the aid and assistance of some who claimed neutrality. 
But the point of the matter is that this is a significant breakthrough. I want to thank Ambassador Borer. I think he is to be commended because this is a significant departure and one that is long overdue from the past policies that said, `Oh, no; these are secret accounts. They have been opened up that way,' and then requiring people to go through incredibly difficult, if not impossible, proofs, requiring them to come up with sums of money that in many cases people just do not have. 
The question of having people, in the past, turned back because they did not have a death certificate of a family member who died in the death camps--that kind of thing has taken place repeatedly over the years. 
It certainly did not bode well for the fiduciary responsibility that the banks held up. They were the beacon and the repository of people's money, that they could rest at ease that their families would be protected and the assets protected. Indeed, the veil of silence worked to enrich others at the expense of the legitimate heirs. 
So, for the ambassador to be able to bring about this sea change--this is a sea change, this is a significant breakthrough. I look forward to continuing to work in this area to see to it that the publication of these names takes place as quickly as possible so that there can be this feeling of closure that many are looking for. It is not just the money. It is a question of justice that people are seeking. 
Mr. President, I am heartened today by this very significant action that the Swiss Bankers Association have pledged. I look forward to working with the ambassador and the other representatives of the Swiss Government in seeing to it that this matter is dealt with sooner, rather than later. This is the commitment that they have made. This is a very prestigious, very important group. I hope this can be carried out, again, within a matter of days or weeks. Mr. President, 52 years is too long to have waited for this to take place. But better now than never. It still is, hopefully, the harbinger of better things to come in terms of clearing up and getting down to the roots of what has taken place. 
I commend the ambassador for this and say that I am very heartened because I think this is a tangible success. I also say to the World Jewish Congress and Edgar Bronfman and Israel Singer, they are to be commended for never losing faith in continuing their effort. Without their persistence, we never would have reached the point where we now have a proposal to put $4.7 billion forward in a humanitarian fund to be administered by a number of organizations in countries that will play a part in determining those people who are most in need. That fund would be administered over a period of some 15 years. Without the World Jewish Congress and its leadership, its perseverance, we never would have achieved the results I am speaking to today. That is, the publication of the names of those people who had dormant accounts, going back to 1945, nor would we have achieved the setting up of this humanitarian fund to aid those who are elderly and most in need. 
I thank the Chair and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me speak, if I might, to an issue of critical national importance--an issue that has plagued the people of the State of New York, most particularly those in Long Island. I am talking about Nassau and Suffolk County, the communities of Long Island. A major county is described legally as a county that has more than 250,000 women, for the purposes of compiling these statistics. And they are dreadful statistics because we are talking about the incidence of breast cancer. Long Island has had an unenviable position of being ranked No. 1 in the incidence rates of breast cancer in years gone by. 
It is incredible. As a result, the National Institutes of Health has undertaken a very comprehensive study, one of the first of its kind, which says we will look to see what environmental factors may be contributing to these high rates of breast cancer. They are undertaking that study. Some $5 million has been allocated. Mr. President, that $5 million is not enough, even though it is among the most sophisticated studies being undertaken. 
Recently, some very real questions have arisen as it relates to what impact there may be as it relates to radioactive materials, radio nuclides, and other materials that may have gained entry into the groundwater system, or that may, as a result of being dispersed in the air, some of these radioactive materials out in Brookhaven, Long Island. What impact has this had, if any? 
Indeed, it seems to me, if we were to spend $5 million, that is not an inconsequential sum. But one of the most comprehensive studies undertaken--this is a study that will take over 5 years; not to complete this study, addressing all concerns, as it relates to the high rate of breast cancer on Long Island, would be wrong. The scientific community will not have completed its chore. And part of that is to be able to say to the public we have examined the situation. 
Brookhaven National Lab--and it seems we may have an additional responsibility--has been run under the aegis of the Department of Energy. May I say here and now that it has been run abysmally as it relates to the impact of its operation on the community. 
Over the years, there has been a litany of abuses of burying of waste materials, hazardous waste, of creating almost a dump site of indifference to the operation of this lab where, indeed, the water tables have been impacted and have actually had radioactive materials--tritium--discharged; and the reports of leaks, and the reports of these discharges have been systematically withheld from the public. The lab has operated with an indifference to public health--`The public be damned' attitude. I commend the Assistant Secretary for Energy, who has come in to look at what can be done to straighten this fiasco out. The scientists have been more concerned with the success of their project than they have in terms of what the operational impact is. You would think some of the world's leading scientists would know that to even pose a threat to contaminate the drinking water, the drinking supply system, is just unconscionable. Yet they have been there with 
total indifference. 
So I mention this because there is a real reason why that study should be expanded. The NIH has done an outstanding job with the funds available. They have not had sufficient funds. 
That is why it was last Wednesday I spoke to Senator Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We are going to be undertaking a supplemental appropriations on this floor. 
By gosh, let me tell you when we have disasters, we should take care of them. This is a disaster. We should see to it that there are the necessary funds. Not only on Long Island, but we have another facility in Seneca, NY. It is a small community with an incredibly high incidence of breast cancer. 
Why do I mention Seneca? There is very direct Government responsibility because we operated a huge storage depot there for all kinds of materials, such as atomic, et cetera. Some of them are still classified and are stored there. It has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the Nation. They should be included. The people of that community should have a comprehensive study. 
I have requested of Senator Stevens consideration that we increase the NIH funding. We are not talking hundreds of millions. But we are asking, and I have asked him. Hopefully they will include some $15 million so that Long Island's study can be brought to a successful conclusion so that they can monitor the operation as it relates to whether radioactive materials have had any impact on the groundwater and in the incidence of breast cancer and to the health of Long Island. 
So whether it be Seneca, or whether it be my colleagues who seek funding from other parts of the country, California, New Jersey, or wherever it might be, the State of Florida, where people would come and say, `We want to know. Are there environmental factors that are contributing to the higher rates?' We should be doing this. 
I want to commend Senator Stevens for his looking at this. I hope that we will all be supportive. 
So it is not a question of us appropriating money just so that we can do this for Long Island. I am concerned about that, and Seneca in upstate New York, but, indeed, the people of this Nation. 
I can't think of a better allocation of resources than to use this to ascertain with definitiveness with the best science available so the communities can raise their children with a piece of mind that there are hazards that can be avoided and are identified. 
I just leave you with one chilling statistic as it relates to the 3 million people who live in Nassau County and Suffolk County. More than half of them are women. Women who live on Long Island for more than 40 years are 70 percent more likely to come down with breast cancer than a woman of comparable age, et cetera, and background who lives there for 20 years. Why? That is why there are so many of us who think there are some very real environmental factors that must be considered. 
So I hope that all of my colleagues could support this increase of $15 million, which is a very modest sum, to expand the NIH; and, yes, to earmark for breast cancer research to ascertain what impact the environment may have in causing the higher incidence. 
I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for being so generous in permitting me the opportunity of making this presentation in morning business. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support the legislation known as the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act. Now, that is legal jargon for saying that we have a real problem, one that is, on a daily basis, getting worse and worse, one that is exposing our most vulnerable homeowner population--our senior citizens--to very, very serious abuses. 
Let me, if I might, just explain to you the problem without going through all of the intricacies of this legislation, which I might add is supported and cosponsored by approximately 25 of my colleagues. The bill's cosponsors are about equally divided, Republicans and Democrats, and include just about the entire Banking Committee. 
Who are these people who are being scammed, who are being victimized? They are our parents, our grandparents, our senior citizens. They are elderly homeowners in America who are being induced by some people who masquerade as estate planners. This is not an attack on estate planners. This is not an attack on those financial consultants who give people advice. This is an attempt to stop thieves, con artists and swindlers, masquerading as helpers to the elderly, but who are nothing more than rip-off artists. 
What do they do? Congress, through HUD, has initiated a program of reverse mortgages whereby many seniors who are cash poor and who have equity in their homes, people who have paid off their homes, and find themselves without the ability to pay their taxes, to keep up their home, or to take care of their daily needs, people have utilized reverse mortgages whereby they can go to the bank. They might have $100,000 value in their home and may receive a $50,000 mortgage which they may take out on a monthly basis or they may take out the entire amount and thereby budget for themselves their needs. 
Now who is a typical borrower of this reverse mortgage plan? What is the profile? They are 76 years old. They are with less means than a typical elderly home owner. Their annual income is $10,400 per annum. One-quarter of them have incomes of less than $7,700. Mr. President, 78 percent of the total income that they have comes from Social Security. 
What do the scam artists do? Today, because of the availability of so much credit information and information with respect to the lives of every citizen, they solicit those people who are elderly, who own their own home. Many of them are living alone. Sixty percent of these people that use the HUD reverse mortgage program need to use it because they do not want to be forced to sell their homes and leave their communities. That is where their friends and neighbors and relatives live. Sixty percent are females living alone, 12 percent are males living alone. So, fully over 70 percent are elderly who are living alone. 
So they get a profile on these people and they literally go door-to-door and say, `We are in the business of financial consulting. If you would like, we could help you obtain a mortgage, a reverse mortgage, one you do not have to pay back. Only when you eventually sell your home or if you pass away, will the proceeds come due, and we can get you $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000.' For this advice, they often charge these people 10 percent of the mortgage loan amount. Most times they never tell them that there will be any kind of a fee, nor do they advise them that this information is available free, or that HUD will make this available, or send them the information. 
So literally, because they know of this program, they are able to go out and take as much as 10 percent for a $50,000 mortgage for information that is available at no cost, and literally do nothing but relieve the people of their money. 
Here is, Mr. President, an advertisement. They are not happy just going door-to-door or by telemarketing themselves. They are now franchising, franchising, this kind of thievery. Here is an advertisement called `America's Trust, Inc: Tap into a totally new market of opportunity. Duplicate the system that allowed us to expand by 400 percent in 60 days.' It goes on to say if you want to become one of our door-to-door solicitors or one of our telemarketers, why, you can earn a 3-percent commission, and, by the way, you can do literally dozens of these referrals on a weekly basis and we will give to you a 3-percent commission, 
because they give them 3 percent and they keep 7 percent. And this poor homeowner is paying money for a service that virtually gives them nothing, but just refers them to a Government program. That is wrong. 
Mr. President, that is why we are seeking to pass this legislation that would stop unscrupulous high-pressure middle men from preying on elderly homeowners by exploiting the reverse mortgage program. 
I have explained to you what the problem is. The bill will put an immediate stop to the practice of predators taking advantage of senior citizens. HUD's Federal Housing Administration Conversion Mortgage Program, known as HECM, is a reverse mortgage program. It allows seniors age 62 and older to borrow against the equity in their homes. It is a great program; it has assisted approximately 20,000 people. But, again, we find the masquerader coming and preying on the elderly. The average person is 76 years old and has an average income of $10,400. These homeowners are tracked down and enticed to apply for a reverse mortgage and conned into paying thousands of dollars for this service, which HUD provides for free. They are totally unregulated companies, often changing names and locations. 
The following are true examples: One 75-year-old woman who resides in southern California read a brochure about reverse mortgages at a senior citizens center. She contacted the so-called information service, one of these scam artists, who met with her and referred her to a lender. The FHA-approved lender then handled the loan for her. She was surprised and shocked to learn that she now had to pay $5,200 to the so-called information service for that referral. That is just wrong. 
Another elderly woman, also in California, was called by a telemarketer who persuaded her to apply for the HUD reverse mortgage program. This person called himself an estate planner. She paid the planner $5,500 just for the referral--no other services. She paid a 10-percent fee just for them saying, `Here, call HUD.' 
Here is another heartbreaking story. A 91-year-old California widow with cataracts was solicited for a reverse mortgage. While she originally refused, she said she was eventually worn down and agreed. Due to her cataracts, she was unable to read the mortgage documents, and nobody explained to her what she was signing, and she ended up paying a 10-percent fee. She states that she would not have applied for the mortgage had she known she would be paying a 10-percent fee. 
This is what goes on and on and on. There are stories about people who are literally coerced, because of their age, to invest their mortgage proceeds in annuities they had no real reason to want or need. These practices must be stopped. This bill will provide HUD the ability to issue an immediate interim order, setting rules and regulations so that legitimate estate planners can continue, and those high-jinx artists who are abusing and defrauding--and actually franchising--what is left of senior citizens' assets will be precluded from doing so. 
HUD--and I have spoken to Secretary Cuomo who, within an hour of the final passage of this legislation, will enact those rules and regulations that will prevent these scam artists from dealing with FHA-approved lenders. They will no longer be permitted to do that. The lender will be precluded from working with anyone who is receiving these types of commissions. Now, HUD has attempted to do this. The court system has said, no, you must follow proper rulemaking procedures. That is why we are here. That is why it is a situation of some exigency, because every day, every hour, we have more and more seniors who are potentially being victimized. So it is an urgent question of time.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I simply want to say that no one has worked harder in bringing this matter to light and sponsoring this legislation than Senator Bryan. He has pointed out that there are 12 million elderly homeowners who own their homes free and clear, and what has taken place is that they have become targets of these people who masquerade as estate planners. There are tens of thousands of older homeowners who are house-rich but cash-poor and have successfully utilized this program. But we have to see to it that we keep these scam artists from moving in further. The success of the reverse mortgage program has opened the door to scam artists that are moving into our communities. 
To date, fortunately, this has not become a situation that is widespread. Hopefully, we will be educating people by speaking to them today and telling them to watch out. But, more importantly, we should see to it that they have the protections afforded by this legislation. Let me also say that the State of Nevada has many senior citizens who are potential targets. Obviously, the Senator from Nevada is very concerned. 
Mr. President, one who has worked tirelessly in this matter has been Senator Dodd. I yield the floor to my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, let me commend Senator Dodd for his leadership in this and say to him that, No. 1, it is absolutely imperative that we see to it that our senior citizens are protected. If you stop and look at the numbers that I have indicated to you, 72 percent of all of these seniors live in their homes alone. For the most part, they are widows or widowers. What targets, what inviting targets they are. They are struggling to keep their homes, and these scam artists come along and say, `We have the way for you to do it.' Well, there is a way provided by the reverse mortgage program, without being ripped off for $5,000 or $6,000. They are bandits. We are going to make this immoral, horrible practice now illegal. Technically, they have been able to get away with this. This legislation will give to Secretary Cuomo the ability to prevent this. He has said to us that, within 1 hour of Congress giving him that authority, he will exercise that authority. So that is the least we can do. 
I ask that Senator Helms be added as an original cosponsor.

Mr. DAMATO. Let me say that Senator Dodd has mentioned something that I think we can do, and that is we will attempt to do two things. First, where we have struggling communities that are working to upgrade themselves, we can and should be able to make the kind of investment that for not much in the way of dollars will lead to revitalization. 
I have met with people in the community today from Riverhead, Long Island, where a self-help program is attempting to take some of the old homes, in many cases that have been abandoned, and upgrading them. They are doing this on their own initiative. They are doing this without any Federal funds. 
It seems to me that through an enlightened program of revolving credit that we could provide a minimal amount of money--not tens of millions--but in some cases $100,000, or maybe something in the area of several hundreds of thousands of dollars, which communities could use in their own self-help programs to purchase distressed properties, coupled with low-rate mortgages for first-time home buyers. They want to be in a position where they can say to their communities, `Help us rehabilitate these distressed properties' and then provide young people the opportunity of homeownership that otherwise might not be available. 
I am looking forward to working with Senator Dodd in this area. Sometimes it is a small program in a community that can grow and develop a pride that can bring about increased support for homeownership in that community. 
I am looking forward to working to do that. I think the potential is unlimited. We have an obligation to attempt to do that. We don't need big national organizations that sometimes become counterproductive. They are worried about their own image, and they have lost sight of how to help smaller communities help themselves as opposed to Big-Brother Government coming in and saying, `By the way, we can give them some of these tools.' 
So I share this with you because I was so impressed by Mrs. Stark, whose husband is the local supervisor in the Town of Riverhead, who said `This is what we are doing, Senator.' I said, `You know, we should be part of this to try to provide that opportunity.' 
We are talking about an important subject, protecting the elderly. We have an obligation to see to it that we protect them, but also to give real opportunities to young families as well. 
I look forward to working with my friend and colleague on this.

Mr. DAMATO. That is absolutely correct. Questions asked should include: has the prospective reverse mortgage recipient made or signed any agreement or contract authorizing any fees to a third party? Does the homeowner have the intention to or made any commitments to a third party to use the reverse mortgage proceeds to purchase any annuities, life insurance policies, or for other investment purposes? Has the homeowner been referred to the HUD-approved housing counseling agency or FHA-approved lender by a third party broker?

Mr. DAMATO. Yes, that is the intention. S. 562 also includes a requirement for disclosure to the mortgagor of the costs of all services related to obtaining the HECM loan, including estate planning and financial advice. HUD should implement this disclosure requirement in a reasonable manner. HUD will not be required to mandate disclosure of the costs of services of persons such as attorneys or accountants who are in the business of giving professional advice. For fees not required to be included in the mortgagee's good faith estimate under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, mortgagees should be permitted to rely on inquiries made to the mortgagors to determine if mortgagors have received the necessary disclosure of cost.

Mr. DAMATO. I would be pleased to do so. I believe the National Housing Act currently gives HUD the power to protect elderly homeowners seeking home equity conversion mortgage loans, including the authority to regulate or prohibit unnecessary or excessive fees that mortgagors pay to third parties for referrals to HECM lenders and related services. Due to the urgent need to protect elderly homeowners, S. 562 will require HUD initially to implement these provisions through an interim notice in the Federal Register. HUD will also be required to proceed with formal notice and comment rulemaking and issue a final rule within 90 days. If needed to meet the 90-day target, HUD may provide an abbreviated public comment period.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill in an effort to protect the vast majority of patients in this country. Currently, in order to control the cost of health care, managed care organizations often place limits on the delivery of necessary medical services. I believe American families must be guaranteed basic health rights when dealing with HMOs and managed care providers. The bottom line in medicine must be the health of the patient, not the profits of any given company. This legislation, the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act, will meet this obligation. 
With this Act, I seek to establish basic protections for patients and health care providers in order to ensure the best medical care for patients. I envision these basic provisions giving Americans a set of health rights, in the form of a Patients' Bill of Rights, when dealing with HMOs and other health insurance plans. These rights include: 
The Right to Choose Your Own Doctor. This bill will allow patients to select their own doctors within their plan and change their selection of doctor as the patient feels necessary. It also gives patients, who are in managed care-only health plans, the option to see doctors outside their HMOs for an additional fee. 
The Right to Quality Health Care. This legislation will ensure that doctors are not prohibited or limited in any way from discussing a patient's health status, treatment options or any other medical communications. It also stops HMOs from using financial incentives for doctors to deny or limit care to patients. We must make sure that health care decisions are based on sound medical criteria and not the financial bottom line. 
The Right to Justice. This Act closes loopholes in current law that allow the vast majority of health insurance plans to escape legal responsibility for decisions causing needless injury or death to a patient. Currently, self-insured managed care plans cannot be held liable for a patient's wrongful death or personal injuries resulting from plan policies even when those policies directly contributed to the patient's death or injury. This is wrong and this bill would guarantee that if HMO policies hurt patients, the HMO will be held accountable for their actions. 
In addition, within a patient's health plan, this bill guarantees patients can quickly and easily appeal adverse decisions by their manage care plans. We've heard too many horror stories of patients who have been denied treatment by a health plans' policy. In addition, the appeals process is too bureaucratic and lengthy, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences. We must always put the quality of patient care first. 
The Right to Full Disclosure. This bill also provides that health insurance plans make available to each patient a list of what health care is covered, what are the plans costs and profits, and how much is the plan spending on marketing and other non-medical costs. This is a sort of `truth-in-lending' statement for health plans. 
When I first considered introducing this Patients' Bill of Rights, I was concerned about how prevalent a need there was for this type of legislation. I quickly found numerous instances where patients were suffering adverse outcomes from poor medical decisions made by managed care companies. The most publicized recent case is Corcoran versus United Health Care. In this case, Ms. Corcoran, a Louisiana woman with a high risk pregnancy, was admitted to a hospital under her physician's orders. She was discharged from the hospital after her health plan refused to pay for her care. The health plan would only authorize a visiting nurse to check on the woman at home. At one point, when the nurse was absent, the unborn child went into distress and died. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the woman had no right to sue the HMO for damages because 
the insurance plan was governed under ERISA laws. These laws preempt state insurance laws allowing patients to seek due process. Americans cannot expect health care with this type of managed health care. 
As I said before, there are numerous instances where managed care is revealed to be ruled by a company's profits. In New York, a diabetic developed an infection in his foot that had become gangrenous and had spread all the way to his groin. Almost his entire leg was infected and the blood vessels clogged. His doctor, a cardio-vascular specialist, feared that the gentleman could lose his foot if treatment was not initiated immediately. So, as a responsible physician, he admitted his patient to the hospital where he was immediately treated with intravenous antibiotics to combat the infection. Once in the hospital, the gentleman's HMO contacted the doctor to find out how long he anticipated the hospital stay would be. Since the man had clogged blood vessels and had to undergo a vascular bypass in order to be treated, the doctor estimated a stay between 10 and 15 days. 
Upon learning this, an HMO official went to the gentleman's hospital room, and without even notifying the doctor, told the man that `he could watch Oprah and be treated as well from home with a visiting nurse.' The gentleman's doctor repeatedly argued with the HMO that it was not medically safe to release his patient from the hospital. But, with fluid still draining from his wounds and the doctor still protesting against the early discharge, the gentleman was sent home just a week after being admitted. The next day, the HMO sent a nurse--not a cardiovascular specialist or even a doctor, but a nurse--to his home to evaluate his condition and to show his wife how to change the dressing covering his wounds. With this state of affairs, the man eventually required surgery. With the early discharge and the lack of responsible care on the part of the HMO, the surgery had to be postponed because the patient's blood had become too thin to safely perform surgery. 
In Georgia, a 2-year old boy was suffering from a high fever which did not respond to medication. His parents followed the insurance company's instructions for pre-authorization of emergency room care and attempted to drive 42 miles to the preferred hospital. The couple passed five emergency rooms along the way. Before they could reach the preferred hospital, their son went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing. The child slipped into a coma, developed gangrene in his extremities, and subsequently lost his arms and legs to amputation. 
In California, a young girl was diagnosed with Wilm's tumor, a rare childhood kidney cancer. The families new HMO required that the girl's surgery be performed by a surgeon within the managed care plan. None of the plan's surgeons had any experience with Wilm's tumor. The family chose to use an expert surgeon outside of the plan who had a proven track record with this type of tumor. The surgery was a success and the child has fully recovered. However, the HMO denied coverage for going outside of their system causing the family to enter a 2 year legal battle with the plan. In the first ever enforcement action against an HMO for a patient complaint, the state imposed a $500,000 fine against the plan for denying appropriate medical care. 
In Colorado, a 75-year old woman was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer, but her plan refused to authorize surgery to remove the kidney and tumor of such an elderly woman. The plan only relented and allowed the surgery to be performed when a Congressman finally intervened on her behalf. The lady's cancer is now in full remission. 
In Texas, a 17-year old Texas girl was critically injured in a head-on car crash that left her with severe head trauma, a broken back, a crushed pelvis, and numerous other injuries. She eventually pulled through, but her health plan refused to pay $40,000 of her hospital bill because her family had not received `prior authorization' for her emergency admission to the hospital--even though the hospital was a preferred provider for the plan. 
These stories are not isolated incidents. They do not happen just in New York and Georgia, but across the nation. They speak for the thousands of patients across the country who have been denied access to the responsible care they need and deserve. 
Mr. President, I believe it would be beneficial for my colleagues if I summarized what rights this bill will provide for patients across the country and how this bill meets those rights. 
First of all, we are trying to increase patient access to plans and doctors. Patients, including those in under served inner-city and rural areas, are ensured their choice of doctor within the plan. The bill will ensure that health plans have enough doctors to guarantee this choice. Patients will also have access to any specialist required by their medical condition within the plan. In addition, patients are to have emergency health care without the burden of seeking prior approval from their health plan. 
Also in this Act, patients will have an expanded choice of health care providers inside and outside of the network. People can either go through the network, or choose a plan that allows them to go out of the network, although at a higher cost. They will be allowed to select their own personal doctors within their plan and change their selection as the patient feels necessary. Patients will also be given the option to choose a health insurance plan that covers health care options not offered in the network. The managed care plan would reimburse the costs of these services based on rates consistent with those negotiated under the plan. Patients would be responsible for any remaining costs. 
This bill will include a prohibition on gag rules. Patients are ensured that the health plan will not in any way limit doctors from discussing the patient's health status, treatment options or any other medical communication. Health plans can not offer any incentives, financial or otherwise, for doctors to deny or limit any health care. 
In addition, this Bill of Rights forces HMOs to be responsible for their decisions. Currently, HMOs can not be held liable for wrongful death or personal injury suffered by the medical decision making policies of the plan, action may only be brought against the doctor and the hospital. Even if the HMO or the plan had in place a policy which directly contributed to death or injury of a patient, they are protected. This bill changes that by ensuring that managed care plans are held responsible for any medical decisions that they make. This bill says that if you make a medical decision, no matter who you are, you will be responsible for your actions. ERISA was never intended to be used as a shield for health plans providing negligent medical care. Also, there will be a provision providing due process on patient appeals claims made to their heath plans. Within the plan, patients will be guaranteed the ability to quickly and easily appeal adverse decisions. 
The act will establish an information disclosure provision allowing patients to make informed decisions about which health plan would be best for them. This is a sort of `Truth in Lending' statement for HMO's. Every health plan will be required to disclose information about plan benefits, appeals procedures, plan performance measures, history of patient satisfaction, as well as the number and type of health care providers participating in the network. Based on this information, patients will be guaranteed the ability to make informed decisions about the quality of their health care and the managed care companies they choose from. 
In addition, there will be doctor and patient protections from discrimination. The provision allows any doctor who meets a clear set of standards the opportunity to be a member of any managed care plan. In addition, patients will not be discriminated against based on their personal background or preexisting conditions, such as long-term and costly diseases. 
Mr. President, we have an obligation to set minimum health care standards in the private sector to protect American families and ensure they have access to quality health care. We cannot allow the profits of the company to get in the way of patient health.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, America has always been a haven for victims of oppression and it is fitting that Members of this body rise every year to mark April 24--the day that commemorates Turkey's genocide of the Armenians. In the first instance in the 20th century when a state declared war on a minority group, an estimated 1.5 million people were killed. We rise today to show our solidarity with the victims and our condemnation of the slaughterers. 
Many Armenian survivors came to the United States, where they found sanctuary. They have prospered and their vibrant community as a whole has become an integral part of American life and the democratic process. But while realizing and contributing to the American dream, they always remembered their Armenian origins, and never forgot their national sorrow. As Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel has written, the Armenian people are rooted firmly `in their collective and immutable memory where death itself is vanquished, because the memory of death is received as a symbol, an instant of eternity.' 
Their sharing of the Armenian historical experience with non-Armenians has served as a stark reminder for us all of the universality of human evil and the strength of the human spirit, even at the darkest moments. The resilience of the survivors and Armenians the world over have inspired in other peoples feelings of shared sorrow and admiration. We mourn with them, and simultaneously take pride in their ability to overcome a great historical injustice, the consciousness of which never disappears. 
Unhappily for them, Armenians have been called upon to be our teachers. From their terrible suffering we have learned that states may not make war upon minority groups, and the international community will neither tolerate nor forget such transgressions. From their ability to transcend the saddest moments of their history, we take heart and recommit ourselves to remembrance, celebration, and vigilance.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, on August 22, 1997, in nearly 100 days, approximately half a million legal immigrants in this country, currently receiving SSI, will lose their benefits. These recipients are elderly or disabled--a vulnerable part of our population. 
Of the 80,000 legal immigrants at risk of losing their SSI benefits in New York State, more than 70,000 are in New York City. The city estimates that there will also be 130,000 immigrants who will lose food stamps. 
According to New York City estimates, the loss of SSI and food stamps to city immigrants is a loss of $442 million from the Federal Government to immigrants in New York City in 1998. 
On April 17, I joined with my colleagues Senators Chafee, Feinstein, Moynihan, DeWine, Lieberman, and Mikulski to introduce legislation that will allow immigrants who were in the United States legally and were receiving SSI and food stamps on August 22, 1996 (the day the welfare reform bill was enacted) to continue to receive those benefits. 
Legal immigrants who were in this country and receiving benefits at the time the welfare reform act was enacted should not have the rules changed midstream. 
The legislation introduced last Thursday also allows refugees who were legally in the United States as of August 22, 1996 to receive SSI or food stamps, without a 5-year limitation. Refugees who entered after August 1996 will only be able to receive benefits for 5 years. 
Congress needs time to enact legislation that will protect the most vulnerable population--the elderly and the disabled who are relying on these Federal benefits and refugees who are fleeing persecution. 
Enacting a legislative fix will take time but the clock is ticking closer to August 1997, when benefits are expected to be cut. 
That is why Senator Chafee, DeWine, and I are introducing a bill that will provide the necessary time for Congress to further examine options and take action. 
The bill will delay the cut-off period for legal immigrants who are SSI and food stamp recipients until February 22, 1998. 
A delay in implementation will also allow immigrants who are trying to naturalize an additional 6 months to complete the citizenship process. This is especially important, because under the Welfare Reform Act, a legal immigrant who becomes an American citizen is eligible for benefits as any other citizen. 
The naturalization process can prove to be a bureaucratic nightmare--especially for elderly and disabled poor immigrants. These people should not be unfairly penalized for being caught in the bureaucracy. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues review the merits of this bill, as well as the Chafee-Feinstein-D'Amato bill to restore benefits to certain categories of immigrants, and hope for their passage.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, today I introduce the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1997. This legislation is substantively identical to S. 1317 which the Senate Banking Committee reported in the 104th Congress. The bill would repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, [PUHCA] and would transfer residual regulatory authority from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and State public service commissions. 
Mr. President, this bill is introduced with the bipartisan cosponsorship of Senators Murkowski, Dodd, Sarbanes, Gramm, Shelby, Mack, Faircloth, Allard, Lott, Domenici, Akaka, Inouye, Coats, Cochran, Roberts, Brownback, Coverdell, and Specter. 
Mr. President, this legislation would eliminate duplicative, unnecessary regulation which unfairly burdens a few utility holding companies. It would allow holding companies to improve service and possibly lower the costs of consumers' utility bills. The bill would enhance existing regulatory tools and provide State and Federal regulators new authority to ensure that they can protect energy consumers from unfair rate increases. 
PUHCA was originally enacted more than six decades ago to regulate public utility holding companies. At that time, this Federal statute was needed to fill the regulatory gap that enabled holding companies to conceal assets by creating and speculating in public utility companies. 
Mr. President, PUHCA has achieved the congressional purpose--it broke up the mammoth holding company structures that existed more than half a century ago. PUHCA is not only outdated, it is the relic of a different era. Today there is strong regulation of the energy industry at the State and Federal level. In addition, the Federal securities laws' registration and disclosure requirements have become effective tools for the SEC to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the market for public utility holding company securities. 
Originally enacted to protect consumers and investors, PUHCA has become an unnecessary impediment to efficient and flexible business operations. Currently, there are 180 public utility holding companies in the United States. Of these 180 companies, 165 are exempt from PUHCA and only 15 companies are subject to direct SEC regulation. As a result, PUHCA imposes a burdensome regulatory scheme on these 15 registered holding companies and prevents them from diversifying into new business areas. PUHCA keeps these holding companies from diversifying, limits their growth opportunities and options, and requires the companies to apply for SEC permission to engage in almost all new business activities. 
PUHCA also hinders the growth of nonregistered, exempt holding companies. Once exempt companies expand their business across State lines they too become subject to PUHCA's restrictions. As a result, exempt companies refrain from expanding across State lines even when such a move would lead to cheaper and more efficiently produced 
energy for consumers. Similarly, PUHCA prevents non-utility holding companies from diversifying into utility business. 
Mr. President, PUHCA is more than just another example of Government overregulation--it is an impediment to both the deregulation of the energy industry and to the growth and diversification of existing businesses. Since many States have begun to deregulate the energy industry and Congress plans to review energy reform issues, the time for PUHCA reform is now. This year, in my own backyard, Long Island, two utility companies will merge. This merger is expected to reduce energy bills for Long Island energy customers who currently pay the highest rates for energy in the continental U.S. The merger will not only lead to lower rates, but it should also mean better service for customers. 
While Long Island's energy customers can finally look forward to lower rates, PUHCA prevents other utility companies from expanding, merging, and offering new services to consumers. Like any other utility merger, the State, the FERC and other Federal regulators will have to approve this merger. Under PUHCA, if either of these companies was a registered holding company or the merger involved companies from neighboring States, the companies would also have to seek SEC approval of the merger in advance and at all subsequent stages of restructuring. For example, if this merger included utility companies from New Jersey or Connecticut, PUHCA's restrictions on diversification and burdensome requirements, could have prevented a merger that would benefit consumers, investors, and business. 
As one of the leaders in energy deregulation, New York State provides an example of why PUHCA reform is necessary now. Without PUHCA reform, companies will choose alternative corporate structures to avoid PUHCA's restrictive requirements, preventing the efficient restructuring of the energy industry. Congress must reform PUHCA so that the energy industry will be efficient and consumers can realize the reduction in rates and improvement in services they deserve. 
Mr. President, the bill I introduce today follows the SEC's Division of Investment Management's 1995 recommendation to conditionally repeal PUHCA since `the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, in direct administrative charges and foregone economies of scale and scope, that often cannot be justified in terms of benefits to utility investors.' The legislation has been crafted in consultation with State and Federal utility regulators, public interest groups, the Senate Energy Committee, and both registered and non-registered utility companies. 
Mr. President, let me summarize the purpose of the bill. The Public Utility Company Act of 1997 would maintain the provisions of the 1935 Act essential to consumer protection. In fact, the bill enhances consumer safeguards by enabling energy regulators to oversee all holding company operations. Specifically, the bill makes it easier for FERC and State public service commissions to protect consumers from paying nonutility 
related costs by giving the regulators expanded authority to review the books and records of all holding company activities to determine energy rates. At the same time, the bill would preserve FERC's authority to review transactions, acquisitions, and mergers of utilities and would clarify the FERC and state commission's authority to allocate costs when setting rates. The bill also gives state commissions vital enforcement backup to ensure that they can access all the books and records necessary to make rate determinations. 
Mr. President, the goal of PUHCA reform is increased competition--to make sure consumers ultimately pay lower utility rates not higher ones. While some would prefer to address PUHCA reform in the larger context of comprehensive energy deregulation, there is no reason to delay consideration of this separate bill I introduce today. Rather than package PUHCA with comprehensive reform of the federal energy laws, PUHCA reform can proceed, on a stand alone basis, as it does not affect the larger energy issues which my knowledgeable colleagues on the Energy Committee are considering. 
In fact, the experts in the energy field, lead by the distinguished chairman and former ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senators Murkowski and Johnston, who testified before the Banking Committee on this issue last year, believe that PUHCA reform should move independently of, and separate from, full energy deregulation. PUHCA reform is a necessary first step in creating an efficient energy industry. 
Mr. President, I have been a proponent of PUHCA reform for 16 years. Congress should allow consumers access to the cheapest power and the best services by repealing this burdensome and unnecessary law. The American people deserve and expect an efficient energy industry unfettered by unnecessary regulation. The legislation I introduce today accomplishes this by removing the energy industry from the 60-year-old regulatory shackles put in place by PUHCA. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so that we may provide consumers with a highly efficient energy market that has better consumer protections.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my colleagues' attention human rights developments in Slovakia. These developments point Slovakia in the opposite direction from the road their neighbors have been traveling. Their neighbors accept western values and seek integration into western institutions, developments leading to individual freedom, political democracy, and economic prosperity in a free market system. In stark contrast, Slovakia is not in compliance with some important Helsinki process commitments and is showing signs of regression toward authoritarian, if not totalitarian relations between the state and its citizens. 
This country, which showed so much promise upon gaining independence in 1993, has failed to press ahead with vitally needed democratic reforms, in contrast with so many other countries in the region, including other newly independent countries. While the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have worked hard to qualify for EU membership and NATO accession, Slovakia has lagged behind. While states like Lithuania and Slovenia have emerged from repressive empires to bring prosperity and hope to their peoples, Slovakia has not. Even Romania, which has struggled profoundly with the transition from totalitarianism, has managed to undertake significant reforms in the past few months. 
From the outset, members of the Helsinki Commission have supported the democratic transformation in Slovakia. We believe that a strong, democratic Slovakia will enhance stability and security in Europe. 
Unfortunately, human rights and democratization in Slovakia have taken a severe beating--both literally and figuratively--in recent months. The hopes raised by free and fair elections and by the passage of a democratic constitution have been dashed 
Last month, I understand some officials in Bratislava criticized a congressional report on NATO enlargement and complained that the discussion of Slovakia's progress toward democracy was too superficial. Well, I will provide a little more detail for those who genuinely want to know what worries us here in Washington. 
Parliamentary democracy in Slovakia took a bullet in late November, when parliamentarian Frantisek Gaulieder, after announcing his resignation from the ruling coalition's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, was stripped of his parliamentary mandate through antidemocratic means that are unheard of anywhere else in Europe. His removal has been protested by the European Union and the United States at OSCE meetings in Vienna, but, so far, to no avail. 
Even more outrageously, there was a bomb attack against Mr. Gaulieder's home, while he and his family were present. This is a tactic that reminds me of the Communists, fascists, and other similarly bloody and ruthless groups. 
The 1995 kidnaping of President Kovac's son is not only still unsolved, but the manner in which this matter has been investigated has fueled speculation that the government's own 
security forces were directly involved in this crime. The murder last year of Robert Remias, who may have had key evidence in this case, and the ineffectual investigation of that case has deepened these suspicions. 
Adding to this disturbing pattern, questions are already being raised about the official investigation of the December bomb attack on Frantisek Gaulieder's home: Mr. Gauliedier has reported that some of his testimony regarding the attack is missing from his police file, that the first investigator was removed after only 3 days on the case, and that the Slovak Minister of Interior has, shockingly, suggested that Mr. Gaulieder may have planted the bomb himself--the same `he-did-it-himself' story that no one believes regarding the kidnaping of Mr. Kovac, Jr. 
I am now informed that this investigation, like the Kovac and Remias cases, has been `closed for lack of evidence.' For a country supposedly seriously committed through its OSCE obligations to the establishment of a `rule of law' state, this is a damagingly poor performance. 
In addition to these acts of violence, it has been reported that the President, the President's son, and members of the Constitutional Court have been subjected to death threats. In fact, in early December the Association of Slovak Judges characterized the anonymous, threatening letters addressed to Milan Cic, the Chair of the Slovak Constitutional Court, as an attack against the court as a whole and a means of political intimidation. 
It has also been reported that on February 24 an opposition political figure in Banska Bystrica, Miroslav Toman, was attacked by four assailants. 
We see a country where politically motivated violence is on the increase, where public confidence in the government's intent to provide security for all Slovaks has plummeted, and where acts of violence and threats of violence have brought into question both the rule of law and the very foundations of democracy. 
The ruling coalition has continued to pursue an openly hostile agenda toward a free and independent media and free speech in general. During the course of the past year, two newspapers--Slovenska Republika and Naroda Obroda--have seen a total of 21 editors quit over alleged political interference with their work. Defamation suits launched by public officials appear to be a common vehicle for harassing one's political opponents. 
Most recently, on November 19, the government barred four journalists from attending a regular press conference after the weekly cabinet meeting because the journalists were believed to be unsympathetic to the government. Although this decision was ultimately rescinded after a public outcry--including a protest from the journalists' union--it was further evidence of the government's relentless efforts to curb any reporting it doesn't like. 
In fact, in one of the more shocking episodes of the battle for free speech in Slovakia, it has been reported that Vladimir Meciar--the Prime Minister of the country and, not insignificantly, a former boxer--warned journalist Dusan 
Valko just a few weeks ago that `I will punch you so that your own mother will not recognize you.' So much for Mr. Meciar's tolerance for other points of view and nonviolence. 
The Slovak Government continues to pursue a minorities policy that would be laughable if it were not so wrong and harmful. This policy has included everything from banning the playing of non-Slovak national anthems last year to the more recent decision to bar the issuance of report cards in the Hungarian language, reversing long-standing practices. Such petty gestures are beneath the dignity of the Slovak people, whose heritage has survived more than a thousand years of foreign--and often markedly repressive--rule. The Slovak language and culture, now protected in an independent Slovakia, are not so weak that they can only flourish at the expense of others. 
More seriously, it should be noted that past repressive crackdowns on minorities--for example, in Cluj, Romania, and in Kosovo, Serbia--began by whittling away at the minority language opportunities that had traditionally been respected by the majority community. Accordingly, these seemingly small restrictions on the Hungarian minority in Slovakia may very well be the harbinger of more repressive tactics ahead. 
With this in mind, the failure of the Slovak parliament to adopt a comprehensive minority language law, and the recommendation of the Ministry of Culture that such a law is not even necessary, defy common sense. Current laws on minority-language use in Slovakia do not provide adequate or satisfactory guidance regarding the use of Hungarian for official purposes, as the recent report-card flap shows. Much harm can be done until a minority language law is passed based on a genuine accommodation between the majority and minority communities. 
Finally, recent reductions in government-provided cultural subsidies have had a disproportionately negative effect on the Hungarian community. The Slovak Government's defense, that all ethnic groups have been equally disadvantaged by these cut-backs, is unpersuasive in light of the Culture Minister Hudec's stated intent to `revive' Slovak culture in ethnically mixed areas and to make cultural subsidies reflect that goal. 
While Hungarians suffer from a more direct form of government intolerance, other ethnic groups suffer more indirectly. Put another way, it is not so much government action which threatens Romani communities in Slovakia, it is government inaction. 
According to the most recent State Department report on Slovakia, skinhead violence against Roma is a serious and growing problem; three Roma were murdered as a result of hate crimes last year, and others have been severely injured. Some Roma leaders, in response to their government's inability or unwillingness to protect them, have called for the formation of self-defense units. Obviously, the Slovak Government is just not doing enough to address the deadly threats they face. 
Moreover, the repugnant anti-Roma statements that have repeatedly been made by Jan Slota, a member of the ruling coalition, have fostered this climate of hatred. The fact that the Czech Republic, Germany, and other European countries also confront skinhead movements in no way relieves Slovakia of its responsibility to combat racism, just as Slovakia's skinhead problem does not relieve the other countries of their responsibilities. 
It is time and past time for Prime Minister Meciar to use his moral authority and political leadership to set Slovakia on the right course. He must make clear, once and for all, that Jan Slota--who also called the Hungarian minority `barbarian Asiatic hordes'--is not his spokesman, and that the Slovak National Party's unreconstructed fascists do not represent the majority of the people of Slovakia. 
Mr. President, the leadership of the Helsinki Commission, including my co-chairman, Representative Christopher H. Smith, and ranking members Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Steny Hoyer, have raised our concern about developments in Slovakia with Slovak officials on a number of occasions. Unfortunately, all we hear from the Slovak leadership is one excuse after another, and all we see is a search for one scapegoat after another: it's the Hungarians, it's the Czechs, it's the Ukrainian mafia, it's the hostile international community seeking to destroy Slovakia's good name, it's a public relations problem abroad, not real problems back home--in short, there is always somebody else to blame besides the people that are, in fact, running the country. 
I don't mean to suggest that there have been no positive developments in Slovakia over the past 4 years. In fact, I have been especially heartened by the emergence of a genuine civil society that is increasingly willing to express its views on a broad range of issues. But positive initiatives by the Government have been too few and too far between. 
I make this statement today in the hope that the leadership in Bratislava will start to make real reforms, like their colleagues in Romania, and begin to restore the promising future that the people of Slovakia deserve. Their present policies are leading down a path toward international isolation, increasing criticism, and economic deprivation for their people. One Belarus is enough.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my statement be submitted in the Record at the appropriate place. 
The welfare reform law that passed last year will have an adverse impact on legal immigrants who are elderly and disabled, the most vulnerable of our population. 
That is why I am joining my colleagues, Senators Chafee, Feinstein, Moynihan, DeWine, Lieberman and Mikulski in introducing this legislation to protect vulnerable legal immigrants who are facing a loss of their supplemental security income [SSI] and food stamp benefits this August. 
Now that the welfare reform law is being implemented, with nearly 900,000 SSI recipients nationwide receiving preliminary noncitizen status notices of the changes in the law, there has emerged a crisis facing legal immigrants who are elderly and disabled. 
The Social Security Administration has estimated that these welfare reform changes may result in 434,000 legal immigrants actually losing SSI benefits. 
Of the 80,000 legal immigrants at risk of losing their SSI benefits in New York State, roughly 70,000 are in New York City. New York City also expects that more than 130,000 legal immigrants currently receiving food stamps will lose those benefits by 1998. 
The bill we are introducing will grandfather those immigrants who were receiving SSI or food stamp benefits as of August 22, 1996, the date of enactment of the Welfare bill. And it will grandfather refugees and asylees who were in this country as of August 22, 1996. 
This bill is about making sure that some of the most vulnerable people, the elderly and the disabled, are not pushed out of the SSI and Food Stamp Programs. 
The people of America recognize that many people who are elderly and disabled are in fact unable at times to take care of themselves without assistance through no fault of their own. To turn our back on these people would be cruel and not in keeping with our Nation's tradition of supporting those in need. 
Refugees who have been granted political asylum also merit that extra consideration that comes from leaving one's own country under duress searching for freedom and a new way of life. They also need a hand up and that too is in the great and long tradition of America. 
This is not a welfare bill, it is a bill of fundamental fairness and compassion. These people came to the United Sates and have been living under our laws for years. It is unfair to change the rules on them suddenly. That is the crux of this bill. 
This isn't just a matter of statistics and hypothetical situations of what might happen. There are real people out there, and you can be sure that they are going to get hurt if we do nothing. We are not going to let that happen. 
We want to work with our colleagues to pass a bill that will not put the elderly and the disabled out on the streets.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill offered by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee that will correct a drafting error in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, thereby removing an impediment that would have restricted U.S. victims or their U.S. survivors to sue a country, designated by the Department of State, that sponsored the terrorist act which caused the death. 
The Antiterrorism Act contained provisions that limited the jurisdictional immunities of foreign states, particularly those countries that sponsored acts of terrorism. It was intended that a victim of terrorism who is an American national, or their American survivors, would not be barred from filing a claim against a country that sponsored the terrorist act. Unfortunately, as drafted, it was not clear that Congress intended this right of action to be available to victims who are American as well as survivors who are American, even if the victim who perished was not a U.S. citizen. 
Countries, designated by the Department of State, that sponsor terrorism should be subject to civil suits by the victim or their surviving families. This right of action should be available whether the victim was American or the survivor was American. 
This clarification should allow for the suit of an American citizen whose spouse perished in the destruction of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988. 
I thank my colleague for taking up this issue and urge immediate passage so that justice can be achieved for several of the families of Pan Am 103, and all future victims of state-sponsored terrorism. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I commend the cosponsors of this legislation and thank them for their support of this essential initiative: Senator Lauch Faircloth; Senator Robert Bennett; Senator Paul Sarbanes; Senator Christopher Dodd; Senator John Kerry; Senator Richard Bryan; Senator Barbara Boxer; Senator Moseley-Braun; Senator Tim Johnson; and Senator Jack Reed. 
I am pleased to announce a bicameral, bipartisan response to this injustice. Identical companion legislation is being introduced today by Representative Rick Lazio, chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. I salute Congressman Lazio for his swift response in condemning this outrageous practice and for proposing a legislative solution. I pledge to work side-by-side with him on this important issue until our companion bills become law. 
This legislation has been endorsed by the administration. I would like to commend HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo for recognizing this serious problem, bringing these abuses to our attention, and acting courageously to prohibit their continued occurrence. 
The FHA home equity conversion mortgage program offers elderly homeowners the opportunity to borrow against the equity in their homes. This effective program assists our senior citizens who have substantial equity in their property but have incomes too low to meet ordinary or extraordinary living expenses. A program recipient can receive cash through this reverse mortgage in the following ways: a lifetime guaranteed monthly payment; a line of credit; a combination of monthly payment and line-of-credit options; or a lump sum. These mortgages are originated by FHA-approved lenders, insured by the FHA and purchased by the secondary mortgage market. 
Since the program's inception, approximately 20,000 loans have been made. The median age of borrowers is 76 years old and the median income is $10,400. This reverse mortgage program represents an ideal public/private partnership in which needy, very-low income Americans are aided without cost to the Federal Government. 
Unfortunately, unscrupulous middlemen, posing as service providers or estate planners have taken advantage of seniors by charging unnecessary and excessive fees to assist them in obtaining a home equity conversion mortgage. These predators have charged elderly homeowners fees ranging from 6 to 12 percent of the loan amount. In hundreds of cases, very low-income seniors have been manipulated into paying several thousand dollars in return for ministerial and often meaningless services. The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides information on applying for a reverse mortgage at no cost. 
These abuses must be stopped at once. Such exploitation is absolutely unconscionable. The elderly who are being preyed upon are some of the most vulnerable in our society. Reverse mortgage proceeds are generally used by the homeowner to maintain a decent standard of living and pay for essentials like property taxes, medical bills, and groceries. 
The legislation we are introducing today will assist HUD with its efforts to ensure that our senior citizens are protected. We must ensure that not even one recipient of a HUD reverse mortgage is charged any unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining that mortgage. 
The bill provides two important safeguards to achieve this purpose. First, it provides a requirement that the mortgagor has received a full disclosure of all costs of obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate planning, financial advice or other related services. Second, it clarifies that the HUD Secretary has authority to impose restrictions to ensure that the mortgagor is not charged any unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining a reverse mortgage. 
The legislation requires the HUD Secretary to implement the above described safeguards in an expeditious manner by interim notice. Within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall issue final regulations after providing notice and opportunity for public comment. The terms of the interim notice shall not be effective after the final regulations are in place. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this vital legislation and look forward to its speedy passage by the Senate. The Senate, the House of Representatives and the administration must work together quickly to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable homeowners are no longer victimized.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in the introduction of the Drug Free Communities Act and urge its passage. This bill responds to a distressing increase in teenage drug use by providing startup funding and technical assistance to community coalitions that work together to prevent drug use. 
According to the University of Michigan's 1996 Monitoring the Future study, more than half of all high school students use illicit drugs by the time they graduate. The Office of National Drug Control Policy cited in their strategy report that nearly 1 in 4 high school seniors used marijuana on a past-month basis in 1996. 
The age for which children start using drugs is declining. While the number of teenagers using marijuana increased 37 percent from 1994 to 1995, the age of first use declined from 17.8 years of age in 1987 to 16.3 years of age in 1994. There was also a drop in age for first use of cocaine from 23.3 years to 19 years old. Drug use is starting at an early age. 
Drug abuse costs this country approximately $67 billion a year in social, health and criminal costs. But the 14,000 drug-related deaths each year cannot be calculated in costs. The destruction of lives of the drug users, their families, friends, and neighbors is inevitable. 
The need to correct the trend is imperative and it is communities that can do it. Community coalitions are essential for an effective prevention program. It is the community groups that see the problem first hand and know what is needed in that area to stop children from using drugs. 
This bill will provide the incentive for community action groups to work together for the sole purpose of drug prevention. Groups representing youths, parents, businesses, schools, law enforcement, religious organizations, health professionals, as well as government agencies will be expected to prepare a strategy and implement it--together. But the community must be organized first, prior to receiving grant funds, in order for the coalition to prove a long-term commitment. 
The grants will be distributed to organized community coalitions that have matching funds and those funds cannot be derived from the Federal Government. This requirement ensures that the coalition has support and can be sustained after the grant sunsets. This will not be another Federal program, but rather a means to support organized coalitions that devise and implement a comprehensive antidrug campaign while they get off the ground. 
Several groups in my State have already endorsed this proposal including the Syracuse Police Department, the mayor of Syracuse and agencies in Onondaga County. Respected national organizations that deal with drug and alcohol abuse have also endorsed the proposal including DARE, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Partnership for a Drug-Free America, and Empower America, among others. 
This is a comprehensive strategy to a problem that is best dealt with at the local level. I urge my colleagues to closely review the merits of this bill and support its passage. Our communities need it.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, at the close of last Congress, I submitted a concurrent resolution addressing property claims issues in Central and Eastern Europe. Representative Christopher H. Smith, the cochairman of the Commission, submitted an identical resolution in the House. Today, we are resubmitting this measure, and are joined by all the members of the Helsinki Commission as original cosponsors. 
Mr. President, I wish I could report to you that there has been improvement in this area since our concurrent resolution was submitted last September. Regrettably, there has not. Let me give you just two examples of the kinds of cases that moved me to submit this concurrent resolution. 
In 1991, Latvia passed a restitution law after regaining its independence from the Soviet empire. This law raised the hope that those forced from their homes by the 1940 Soviet invasion, and kept out by a 50-year occupation, would finally be able to return. And this is what Eso Anton Benjamins thought, too, when in 1995 a Latvian municipal court ordered that the current occupants of the Benjamins' family home vacate the property. 
Unfortunately, the current occupant is none other than the Russian Ambassador to Latvia. The Russian Government has refused to move its representative from the private property of Mr. Benjamins, notwithstanding the Latvian court's legal order to do so, and the Latvian authorities have not evicted them. 
In the Czech Republic, things are not much better. Under laws adopted after the Velvet Revolution, Susan Benda is theoretically eligible for the restitution of her family property, which had been confiscated by the Nazis but which her family had been unable to reclaim at the end of World War II. Notwithstanding this eligibility under the law and the Czech Government's purported intention to restore Jewish properties that had been seized by the Nazis, the Czech Ministry of Finance has arbitrarily imposed onerous and burdensome conditions for restitution which appear to be designed to defeat the intent of the law. 
So while Czech officials may tell us they have properly addressed this issue, those seeking the return of wrongfully confiscated property in Prague find that an entirely different reality awaits them. 
I am also deeply troubled by recent reports that some $50 million may have been embezzled from the funds received by Ukraine from Germany for the victims of Nazi prosecution. It is imperative that the Ukrainian Government make an investigation into this matter an urgent priority. Not only must this money be found and returned to the rightful recipients, but immediate measures should be taken to ensure that this cannot happen again. 
Americans who came to this country to escape persecution are discovering that, in many Central and East European countries, they are once again being penalized, this time by discriminatory laws that restrict restitution or compensation to those who currently hold the citizenship of or residency in the country in question. This is the case in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia. 
Mr. President, this status quo cannot continue. I know it is not possible to turn back the clock completely or erase the wrongs that have been done. I commend the many emerging democracies attempting to address this complex issue, acting on both a moral obligation to redress past wrongs and a desire to underscore the differences between their new and old systems of government. But more can and should be done--and this resolution calls for concrete steps. It deserves our support, and the victims of past wrongs in this region deserve our help. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me and the other cosponsors of this concurrent resolution in pressing for a fair, just, and timely property restitution and compensation process so that the victims of the Holocaust and subsequent Communist oppression are not denied what is rightfully theirs.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. This important piece of legislation will address a serious affordable housing crisis by restructuring the Department of Housing and Urban Development's [HUD] Federal Housing Administration [FHA] insured and section 8 assisted multifamily housing portfolio. 
I wish to thank my friend and colleague Senator Connie Mack, chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, for his extraordinary leadership in crafting this measured and thoughtful legislative initiative which deals with a vexing and complicated issue--the approaching crisis in HUD section 8 contract renewals. 
I would also like to recognize Senator Kit Bond, the chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, who has also played a critical role in the development of this bill. I commend him for the significant contributions he has made in addressing this crisis. In addition, I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Robert Bennett for his diligence in confronting this complex issue. 
The legislation we are introducing today is very similar to S. 2042, introduced by Senators Mack, Bond, Bennett, and myself in August 1996. This bill constitutes a major step toward reducing the costs of the Section 8 Program, and will allow for existing residents to be fully protected and for contracts to be renewed.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, one of our Nation's most outstanding citizens Mayor Hattie H. Harris will celebrate her 100th birthday April 25, 1997, God willing. For nearly one century Hattie's unimpeachable integrity, brilliant mind, and inconquerable spirit have dominated the scene in Rochester, NY. She courageously faces each challenge and perpetually accomplishes worthy humanitarian deeds. Hattie consistently demonstrates that eternal youth rules father time. Mayor Hattie's grueling schedule puts to shame some persons half her age. 
Mayor Hattie's unswerving devotion to assisting mankind is a tribute to democracy's dream. She embraces every request to inspire mankind: whether it be delivering meals herself as chairperson of the 1995-6 Meals on Wheels Program, or awarding scholarships from the endowment in her name, Hattie is an exemplary humanitarian. She has received accolades and honors too numerous to list here. Suffice it to say that Hattie has done many good things for good people and has been recognized for many of her efforts with awards, titles, honors, and tributes. 
Hattie was born on April 25, 1897 in Rochester and has lived there all of her life. She had to leave school at the tender age of 11 and become a buttonhole maker to earn money and help support the family. As a child she never had a birthday party, her toys and clothes were second-hand. All her life she has done all she can so other children will get the chances she never did. She has endowments bearing her name at Monroe Community College, St. John Fisher College, Mary Cariola Children's Center, and Campership Fund for Needy Children. 
Hattie is a wonderful human being whose outstanding lifelong humanitarian achievements deserve special recognition from each of us. Happy birthday Hattie Harris.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This important legislation contains significant policy reforms which will greatly improve our Nation's public and tenant based housing programs. The Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997 is very similar to legislation (S. 1260) which was passed unanimously by the Senate in January 1996. 
I wish to salute Senator Connie Mack, chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity, for his successful leadership in the development and passage of public housing reform legislation in the 104th Congress. I commend Senator Mack for his initiative and steadfastness in producing an improved housing bill which builds on the lessons learned during the last Congress. Substantial input from the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD], resident associations, public housing authorities and other interested parties has been received and incorporated into this legislation. 
This legislation addresses just one area of long overdue reform needed at HUD. Given limited Federal resources and the need to balance the budget by the year 2002, Congress must find more cost-effective ways to provide affordable housing. This bill represents a concrete step in the fulfillment of Congress' responsibility to the American taxpayer to ensure that every Federal dollar is maximized to its greatest potential. 
The reform provisions contained in this bill will help to ensure the long-term viability of our Nation's existing stock of affordable housing and reaffirms our commitment to providing decent, safe, and affordable housing. Efficiencies will be realized from the elimination and consolidation of duplicative and burdensome Federal regulations, while the essential mission of our housing programs is retained and strengthened. 
Mr. President, I would like to comment on several guiding principles of the legislation. First, it will reform the public housing system through the devolution of control from the Federal Government to high performing public housing authorities and their residents. It will streamline program requirements, consolidate programs and provide increased flexibility to public housing authorities which have demonstrated a track record of good management. Federal oversight and enforcement of troubled housing authorities will be increased significantly. 
The bill provides incentives to empower public housing residents and facilitate the transition from welfare to work. It provides important linkages to the welfare reform bill which became law last year. This will allow our Nation's public housing residents a greater opportunity to achieve economic independence. 
Mr. President, the bill seeks to increase the local accountability of housing authorities through the implementation of a local planning process. Public housing authorities will prepare 5-year and annual plans which will include all significant matters related to the operation of the housing authority. These plans will be required to be consistent with relevant State and local comprehensive plans. In addition, plans will be reviewed by resident advisory boards. 
The bill recognizes that public housing is most effective when there is a viable income mix among its residents. Federal preferences will be repealed. The Brooke amendment, which requires residents to pay 30 percent of their income as rent, would be altered to allow tenants to pay `up to' 30 percent of their incomes in rent. This will remove a work disincentive which has hampered the economic livelihoods of many residents, while retaining the 30 percent limit as a cap. 
The bill has additional rent reforms such as income disregards which will allow welfare recipients to move to work without losing 30 percent of their new-found income to rent, and ceiling rents which will allow working families to continue to move up the economic ladder without a 30 percent tax on income. 
Mr. President, this legislation ensures that a significant percentage of units that become vacant in a given year will be set aside for the lowest income families. I believe this bill achieves the delicate balance between fostering the growth of mixed-income communities while ensuring that our neediest citizens will continue to be served. 
The safety and security of the residents of public and assisted housing is a paramount objective. Many safety and security measures, including allowing public housing authorities increased access to criminal conviction records and greater flexibility in the eviction of drug criminals, were passed last year in legislation which I introduced, the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act (Pub. L. 104-120). This legislation includes numerous additional safety and security provisions, including allowing HUD to waive rent requirements to permit police officers a lower rent as an inducement to living in project-based section 8 housing. 
Furthermore, the bill will streamline the demolition and disposition process of distressed housing projects through the repeal of the one-for-one replacement requirement and other measures. This impractical and counterproductive Federal requirement has 
been waived for the last 2 fiscal years through the appropriations process. By making this repeal permanent, our housing authorities will be able to operate with certainty. 
Mr. President, the Banking Committee and its Housing Subcommittee will continue to evaluate proposals for HUD reorganization. Legislation to reform HUD's Federal Housing Administration insured and section 8 assisted multifamily properties will be introduced this spring. Additional legislative initiatives to reform HUD and its multitude of duplicative programs also will be considered. 
We must remember that the fundamental goal of this process is to address adequately the affordable housing and community development needs of our citizens in a time of dwindling Federal resources. It is imperative that we protect our needy poor and working class residents whom these programs are intended to serve. Reforms must be made with caution and careful consideration. 
This legislation has been crafted with the benefit of a lengthy and productive debate in the 104th Congress. The Banking Committee conducted a series of hearings on HUD and its public and assisted housing programs during the 104th Congress. Additional hearings are planned for this year. The Banking Committee will seek to achieve the swift implementation of needed reforms. The committee will utilize an open process with an opportunity for input from all concerned parties, which has as its goal the formation of a consensus for change. 
Mr. President, I believe this bill appropriately balances the social purpose of public and assisted housing programs while also responding to Federal fiscal constraints. I look forward to working with all Members of the Banking Committee on a bipartisan basis to ensure the speedy passage of this important housing initiative.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate March 10, 1959, a dark day in history for all of us. It was on this day that Chinese troops viciously attacked and murdered 87,000 Tibetan civilians who sought to protect their beloved Dalai Lama, a man whose love of peace is known to all of us. The pattern of intimidation and human rights abuses by the Chinese Government against the people of Tibet, unfortunately, continues today. It is quite frankly unsuitable for a country like China which seeks status as a responsible member of the community of nations. 
The Chinese pattern of intimidation is especially seen in the case of Ngawang Choephel, a former Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College and friend of the United States. Last December, Chinese officials sentenced Mr. Choephel to an 18-year prison term for supposed espionage activities. This is an outrage. 
In January I joined with other Members of the Senate in writing a letter to the new Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressing our concerns about Mr. Choephel's sentence. We requested that she raise Mr. Choephel's case in discussions with Chinese leaders on her trip to China. 
I also cosponsored a resolution which calls on the Chinese Government to release Mr. Choephel immediately and unconditionally. I am pleased to be a part of a bipartisan effort on this important issue. 
Relations with other powerful countries are by their nature complex, but we owe it to the people of Tibet and we owe it to ourselves as Americans, to stress the importance of human rights as a cornerstone of all relations. All people have a right to religious freedom. The people of Tibet certainly have that right, and they have a right to live in peace. The people of Tibet also have a right to live their lives in a dignified manner free of oppression. It is the sacred duty of all of us to make sure that happens. 
I applaud the efforts of those who are gathering today in New York for Tibet National Uprising Day to show the world that vigilance does not sleep and to express solidarity with the people of Tibet. As long as people such as those who are coming together today in New York take a personal interest in the suffering of others, I have to believe that we will reach our goals of democracy and religious freedom for the suffering people of Tibet.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today, I introduce with Senator Gramm, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Dodd, a bill to extend for 90 days the effective date of title III of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1997. 
The Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act enacted as part of the National Securities Market Improvement Act, divides the regulation of the Nation's 22,500 registered investment advisers between the SEC and State commissions. Under the new divided jurisdiction, investment advisers entrusted with over $10 trillion in customer funds, will be subject to better regulation and regular examination. As a result, consumers and investors will be better protected. 
The legislation we introduce today will extend the effective date of the title III, section 308 of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 90 days, from April 9, 1997 to July 8, 1997. This extension was requested by the Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, in his letter to the committee dated February 12, 1997. The legislation is necessary to ensure that the proper rules are in place to carry out the provisions of this title. While the Securities and Exchange Commission is working diligently to complete its rules by the original effective date, the Commission is concerned that investment advisers will not have enough time to examine the final rules and to complete and submit the new forms required. 
Mr. President, Congress intended for State commissions to regulate investment advisers with assets under $25 million. However, State law will be preempted as it relates to all investment advisers who are still registered with the SEC when the provision becomes effective, regardless of their asset value. This means that if the SEC rules are not final or if investment advisers have not submitted forms to end their registration by April 9, 1997, State commissions will be unable to regulate the investment advisers who fall within their jurisdiction. Extending the effective date of the Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act would ensure that all investment advisers have sufficient time to register with the proper commission and prevent a gap in effective regulation. 
I would like to thank the chairman of the Securities Subcommittee, and the ranking members of both the Banking Committee and the Securities Subcommittee for their cosponsorship of this legislation. It is my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation without amendment or delay so that the SEC and the State commissions can continue to move forward with these important changes to improve the regulation of investment advisers and protect investors.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] to compensate the many State, county, and local governments throughout New York that assisted Federal officials in the rescue and salvage operations immediately following the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800. 
As you will recall Mr. President, on July 17, 1996, TWA flight 800 crashed into Federal waters off the coast of Long Island, NY killing all 230 persons aboard. Immediately following the incident a vast army of rescuers set forth from the counties of Nassau and Suffolk, Long Island, and the city of New York to offer their assistance. Many of the rescuers were ordinary citizens. Others were from U.S. Coast Guard stations located within the area. However, the vast majority of the rescuers came from the many State, county, and local municipalities throughout the region. Braving darkness and rolling seas these heroes set forth upon the Atlantic Ocean, in many cases in small boats piloted by area residents and fishermen to help persons unknown to them. 
In the hours and days immediately following the tragic crash, divers from the city of New York, and the New York State Police, working with Navy and Coast Guard officials, began their search for survivors. Braving frigid waters, darkness and the hazards created by the wreckage itself they soon realized the enormity of the loss of life. They then began the undaunted task of recovering the bodies of those who had lost their lives in the crash. These divers labored around the clock for weeks on end with only a few hours of fitful sleep performing this most sensitive of tasks. The men and women who labored under these harshest of conditions are to be commended. 
While efforts continued under the water, the air above the crash site was filled with activity. National Guard helicopters stationed in New York were requested to transport Federal officials to and from the crash site and to assist in recovery operations. 
On land, National Guard engineers provided cranes to lift large pieces of the aircraft. These pieces were eventually loaded upon National Guard trucks in Brooklyn, NY, and transported to a hangar at Calverton, Long Island where they were reassembled. National Guard units provided security at the Brooklyn and Calverton facilities. National Guard units also provided generators to provide desperately needed lighting to assist in the recovery process. 
Additionally, the New York State Department of Transportation provided steel and lumber in support of the National Guard's recovery efforts. The New York State Department of Corrections provided mobile homes to provide temporary housing for U.S. Navy and Coast Guard officials. New York State, county, and local police officials assisted the FBI with the collection and processing of large pieces of the aircraft. These same officials also provided security at the reassembly facility at Calverton. In probably one of the most sensitive and delicate of efforts, members of the Suffolk County Medical Examiners Office worked tirelessly and expeditiously in the identification of the victims of the crash in order that they might be returned to their loved ones. These are only a few of the examples of the assistance that was provided by and continues to this date to be provided by the citizens of the State of New York to Federal authorities. 
New York State, New York City, Suffolk and Nassau Counties offered their assistance in this emergency without hesitation. However, the magnitude of the rescue and recovery operation imposed tremendous financial strains on these entities. To date, nearly $13 million has been spent by State, city, and county governments and this total could very well increase as the final accountings are tallied. The legislation that I am introducing today will provide financial compensation to these entities for the costs they incurred in responding to and assisting in the efforts to retrieve the bodies and wreckage of TWA flight 800. This legislation will require that all requests for restitution be forwarded directly to the Governor of New York who will in turn submit a request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Total compensation would be capped at $20 million. 
Mr. President, we all commend the efforts of the State of New York, the city of New York, and Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the many thousands of men and women who offered their assistance in this time of need. I believe that this is the right thing to do to provide fair compensation to those entities that responded to this extraordinary and tragic incident. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure and I urge its prompt consideration.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today I rise to once more address a bill I introduced earlier this month. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to not only recognize Frank Sinatra, as one of the most notable entertainers of our time, but also to recognize his unsurpassed humanitarian efforts. 
I am speaking of Frank Sinatra's generous and unostentatious philanthropic accomplishments. This one man has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to benefit the poor, the hungry, the chronically and terminally ill, and a variety of charities for children all over the world. 
The lives of countless ailing youngsters have been touched by the benevolence of Frank Sinatra through his funding of entire hospital units dedicated to caring for children. Specifically, the Frank Sinatra Child Care Unit at St. Jude's Children's Research Center in Memphis, TN, and the Sinatra Family Children's Unit for the Chronically Ill at Children's Orthopedic Hospital in Seattle, WA. 
Let me mention two examples of Frank Sinatra's generosity. This great man set out on a world tour to benefit children's hospitals, orphanages, and schools. He personally and completely financed 30 concerts in 10 weeks stopping in the international capitals of the world. All in all he raised more than $1 million throughout this effort. And that was in 1962. 
More recently, starting in 1979, Frank Sinatra coordinated a historical series of five annual concerts showcasing and sharing the stage with renowned entertainers such as Ella Fitzgerald, Victor Borge, Diana Ross, and opera singers Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, and Montserrat Caballe. 
These five concerts generated $11 million, I repeat, $11 million for the Frank Sinatra Fund of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. These donations have helped ensure that patients of the cancer center who cannot afford treatment are not turned away. 
Frank Sinatra's generosity has channeled money for strengthening educational opportunities and programs for inner-city youths as well as university coeds. Examples of his work stretch from Hoboken, NJ, to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and many points in between. 
Not only has Frank Sinatra done more than a lion's share to assist his fellow man, he has done so through anonymity. He is not one to trumpet his goodwill. And that, Mr. President is a class act. 
I am proud to say that support for this bill from my colleagues has been overwhelming. I thank all of my friends on both sides of the aisle who have looked to the goodness in a fellow man and made the easy decision to recognize that goodness. 
Mr. President, that is the right thing to do. That is what we should do more of. We should rally 'round and show our thanks for the goodwill of individuals who willingly share the fruits of their success with those less fortunate. 
On another note, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the pubic sale of bronze duplicates of the original Frank Sinatra gold medal has a very real potential to raise money for the Treasury.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I hold in my hand a press statement sent to my office and I believe to all of the Senate and House offices from a Congressman from Oklahoma, Congressman Tom Coburn, regarding the showing of `Schindler's List,' this past Sunday. I have to tell you, we had to call the office to assert whether or not this was a joke. We thought it was a prank. The Congressman in his press release goes on to raise concerns on behalf of the family caucus, and says that the airing and demonstration of the television program that depicted sex and violence was inappropriate. He complains about the nudity of the program. 
I cannot believe, and I am shocked and appalled, that any Member of Congress would put out a statement of this kind that shows those who were imprisoned and being sent to their death--it seems to me that anyone who would make a statement condemning `Schindler's List' is totally out of touch with the importance of this historic film, depicting the monstrous deeds that took place and the heroism that was also displayed. 
To equate the nudity of the Holocaust victims in a concentration camp with any sexual connotation is outrageous and offensive. I am shocked and appalled that any Member of Congress would make these kinds of statements. I am particularly embarrassed that they were made by a Member of my own party. 
I understand that the Congressman is planning to make a clarification of his statement. While I await them, I think that everyone should seek that clarification. Certainly, this should not be a view expressed by anyone in public office who is right-thinking. 
Again, I thought this press release was a prank at first, and it was only when I called that we verified it was not the case. The Congressman should respond quickly and clarify exactly what he meant by this statement. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve Dr. Janet Yellen, the distinguished nominee, for the position of the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. The nomination was approved by the Banking Committee by a vote of 17-0. 
Dr. Yellen last appeared before the Senate nearly 3 years ago when she was nominated and confirmed to serve on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. While on the board of governors, Dr. Yellen focused on the important issues of consumer credit and small business lending and provided useful congressional testimony on these topics. 
Prior to her tenure at the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Yellen was the Bernard T. Rocca Jr. Professor of International Business and Trade at the Haas School of Business of the University of California at Berkeley where she taught since 1980. Dr. Yellen has also served as a senior adviser to the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity and as a member of the Economics Panel of the Congressional Budget Office. 
Dr. Yellen has written on a wide variety of macroeconomic issues, including the causes and implications of unemployment. She is also a recognized scholar in international economics, recently focusing on the trade balance and reforms in Eastern Europe. 
Dr. Yellen has distinguished herself in academia and at the Federal reserve. She will bring to this position competence and a record of excellence. I believe the administration and the Congress will both benefit from her wise counsel. 
I am pleased to support this nomination.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce legislation on behalf of 48 Senators. I know and feel very strongly that when all of my colleagues are informed of the legislation that it will be unanimous and that all will join to authorize a congressional gold medal for Frank Sinatra. The time has come for Congress to acknowledge this great American and his contributions to the world of entertainment and society as a whole. 
It is fitting that we honor this man in the autumn of his years, as we have honored Bob Hope, John Wayne, Marian Anderson and other great performers, not only for the fact of their entertainment and the wonderful gift that God bestowed upon them, but for so many other aspects in terms of their bond with America, its people, and their contributions. 
Mr. President, this bill would authorize the U.S. Mint to commemorate the humanitarian and professional accomplishments of Frank Sinatra with a gold medal to be presented by the President on behalf of the Congress. In addition, bronze replicas of the original gold medal will be available to the general public for their private collection. 
It is estimated that not only will we be doing great honor to Frank Sinatra, but, in addition, it will result in a very substantial profit to the Treasury because many will buy these replicas, and indeed millions of dollars can and will be raised by our Government. 
Mr. President, Frank Sinatra has become one of the most, if not the most, recognizable vocalists in America and in the world. This talented man has singularly defined America's love affair with popular music for over five generations and has remained to this day a man of the people, a man who has brought pleasure to countless persons. 
The tremendous, positive impact Frank Sinatra has on people throughout the world is truly phenomenal. His songs have become a standard for young and old alike. Indeed, this impact goes beyond song and it goes beyond adversity. Frank Sinatra knew adversity and he overcame it in his own career rising to great heights. He overcame the trials and tribulations during his life and became a great humanitarian. 
Many people who adore Frank Sinatra and his music are not aware of that other side of the man--his generosity. Truly he could be called Mr. Anonymous because, Mr. President, unlike many who trumpet their generosity, who trumpet their gift giving, Mr. Sinatra did not do this. Indeed, he has raised literally hundreds of millions of dollars--not tens of millions--hundreds of millions of dollars for children, in particular, throughout the world, for those who were in need of help, whether it be for cancer, for AIDS, for retinitis pigmentosa--just name the charity and you will see that Francis Albert Sinatra most likely has been there, quietly giving of his time and his energy in caring for his fellow human being, giving back to the people of this country, throughout the length and breadth, establishing scholarships for young people, going back to his hometown and to his old high school to give of his time and his money. He took his wonderful gift of song and used it as a vehicle of benevolence. 
Let me just touch on one of these as an example. Mr. Sinatra has raised $9 million for just one institution, a great cancer center, Sloan-Kettering, by holding five concerts. I do not know how many know that. He did not ask his publicist to go out and speak to that. The money raised by Frank Sinatra began programs whereby those who are in need of treatment and do not have the financial wherewithal will not be turned away. This is because of the generosity of Frank Sinatra. 
Indeed, New Jersey can be rightfully proud of him, born in Hoboken in 1915 to parents of modest means. I am pleased that both of the Senators from New Jersey have joined in cosponsoring this legislation. Those of us in New York are so proud, and we also claim him as a son of New York. He has given us the gift of his great performances, and we particularly love his rendition of 
`New York, New York.' But look throughout the country, the great Windy City of Chicago, and how fitting that the senior Senator from Illinois has also joined in this tribute which is long overdue. 
Mr. President, it cannot be denied that Frank Sinatra has had a remarkable career. Not long after reaching adolescence, he developed a keen love of music and the desire to perform. In high school he was responsible for screening and scheduling dance bands for Demarest High School's Wednesday night dances. In exchange for hiring musicians, he was permitted to sing a few songs with the different bands. 
A dream was growing in the young Frank Sinatra--his dream of becoming a successful entertainer. By the age of 21, Frank Sinatra was a professional singer. His first group was the Three Flashes, a singing and dancing trio which later became the Hoboken Four. A few years later, Frank Sinatra's investment in vocal lessons would prove to be invaluable as his singing career propelled him into stardom. 
In 1939, Frank Sinatra was hired by Harry James who had recently formed an orchestra of his own. The earliest performance reviews were not favorable, but Frank Sinatra persevered. Seven months later, he was hired away to join Tommy Dorsey's orchestra where he would formulate the essence of his signature singing style. 
After a successful, 2-year tour with Tommy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra made the move to go out on his own in 1942. He recorded the first of numerous hit singles titled `Night and Day.' A year later he made his motion picture debut and had appeared in several movies by 1950. But, as quickly as Frank Sinatra found himself `king of the hill, at the top of the heap,' he found the constant demand on his time and talent contributing to a decline in his vocal quality. 
By the end of 1952, he had lost his agent and his film and recording contracts. The `voice' was nearly lost as well. Frank Sinatra was once eloquently quoted saying: `You have to scrape bottom to appreciate life and start living again.' 
This personally and professionally trying time ended in 1953 with Frank Sinatra's award winning performance playing the role of Maggio in the production `From Here to Eternity.' The rebirth of his career was finally at hand. Frank Sinatra's new stardom quickly surpassed that which he had realized in the 1940's. 
Beginning in the 1960's, Frank Sinatra's flourishing acclaim as a preeminent performer earned him the title `Chairman of the Board.' He established his own recording company, Reprise, and began recording again, this time with more conviction than ever before. Frank Sinatra orchestrated television specials which featured little-known musical talents, performed live for huge, adoring audiences and began to evolve as a legend. By 1984, his singing repertoire included well over 50 albums and record sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Throughout his entertainment career and rise to fame, Frank Sinatra worked tirelessly and steadfastly to cure some of the ills of society. In one of the most outstanding examples of his generosity, Frank Sinatra personally, and entirely, I might add, financed and donated his talent and superstardom along with other renowned performers for a world tour benefitting children's hospitals, orphanages, and schools in six countries. This whirlwind jaunt included 30 concerts in 10 weeks. And never once did Frank Sinatra seek glory from this feat through publicity or any other means. 
Frank Sinatra's generosity has touched the lives of the underprivileged, the terminally and chronically ill, children, minorities and students not only in this country, but in Latin America, Israel, Europe, and Mexico. His works of goodwill have financed entire wings in hospitals, numerous scholarships, educational programs, and student centers. He has selflessly served as chairman on numerous boards for charities and councils borne out of sincerity, humility, and the goal of equality. If I could stand here and recite all of the things Frank Sinatra has done from his 
heart for his fellow man and woman, poor, old, young, sick and the like, and recited all of the awards this giant among us has received, I would be here all day. 
Mr. President, since 1945 Frank Sinatra's national and international humanitarian activities have been recognized. Just as a small sampling, he has been awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the NAACP, the Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild, the New York City Columbus Citizens Committee Humanitarian Award, the Kennedy Center Honors, the Scopus Award from the American Friends of Hebrew University, the Philadelphia Freedom Medal and the highest civilian honor in out country, the Medal of Freedom given to him by another American hero, President Ronald Reagan.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that seeks to protect our Nation's homeowners, particularly low-income and first-time home buyers, from having to pay for unnecessary and costly private mortgage insurance. Thousands of hard working Americans who strive every day to afford a house of their own are unfairly paying for private mortgage insurance which is not required and is no longer necessary. We must not have current and future homeowners paying up to hundreds of millions of dollars a year for insurance that serves no useful purpose. This is a practice which must be stopped. Today, it is unethical. Tomorrow, after this bill becomes law, it will be illegal. This legislation is intended to stop this injustice, while still providing lenders with fair protection against default. 
In 1995, almost 6 million Americans bought homes. Approximately 2 million of those homeowners also purchased private mortgage insurance. Today, over 40 percent of new homeowners purchase private mortgage insurance. Thousands of American homeowners--perhaps as many as 20 percent of homeowners who have private mortgage insurance--are overinsuring their homes simply because they are not informed of whether they have the right to cancel private mortgage insurance. 
Many homeowners are being forced to make payments for private mortgage insurance even after they have accumulated substantial equity in their homes; they continue to pay for private mortgage insurance long after the loan-to-value ratio is sufficient to protect lenders against default. Private mortgage insurance rates average between $20 and $100 per month, depending on the home purchase price, the amount of downpayment and other factors. These consumers are unknowingly paying from $240 a year to $1,200 a year for absolutely no reason--no potential benefit can accrue to the homeowner who is unnecessarily paying for this insurance. When the legitimate need for private mortgage insurance ends, the payments should stop immediately. 
My legislation, the Homeowners' Protection Act, would ensure that this unfair practice is discontinued by giving future homeowners the right to cancel private mortgage insurance when it is no longer needed to protect the homeowner--in most cases, when they accumulate equity equal to 20 percent of their original loan value. With respect to existing mortgages, the Homeowners' Protection Act would mandate disclosure of cancellation rights to the homeowner on an annual basis. This important legislation potentially could save current and future homeowners millions of dollars. 
Now let me make one thing clear--private mortgage insurance does serve a purpose. Typically, lenders require home buyers to purchase private mortgage insurance if the borrower makes a downpayment of less than 20 percent of the purchase price. The purpose of the insurance is to provide lenders, and subsequent purchasers of the mortgage, with protection in the event of default on the mortgage. It is in the best interest of all Americans that lenders have fair protection against default, so as to ensure their continued safety and soundness. Together, we can encourage the pursuit of the American dream of home ownership without allowing the fleecing of homeowners in the process. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in support in this legislation which will help to make sure that money for unnecessary insurance premiums stays where it belongs--in homeowners' pockets.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, today with the cosponsorship of my colleagues, Senators Gramm, Grams, and Bennett, I am introducing the `Depository Institutions Affiliation Act of 1997,' to modernize the laws governing the financial services industry in a comprehensive, progressive fashion. I am pleased that Representative Richard Baker, chairman of the Housing Banking Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises, will introduce similar legislation, joined by Representatives McCollum, La Falce, and Dreier. This legislation will promote efficiency and fair competition between all financial service providers and make U.S. financial firms stronger in global competition. 
Mr. President, Congress has been struggling to modernize the financial system since before I became a member of the Banking Committee in 1981. That effort must continue and should conclude successfully in this Congress. Our existing legal framework is fundamentally outdated. The Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Acts impose regulatory structures that are inadequate for today's global marketplace and the financial needs of consumers. 
Mr. President, our Nation's entire financial system --including traditional banks, insurance companies, and securities firms--faces a future that is somewhat unsettled. Competitive developments in the marketplace and the technological revolution that is well underway have brought about significant changes in the financial system, domestic and international. And these changes have already had a significant influence on all financial services providers and their customers. 
Mr. President, there is widespread recognition that the United States must adopt a regulatory regime that recognizes market realities and assesses and controls risk. Our present patchwork of financial laws protects particular industries, restrains competition, prevents diversification that would limit risks, restricts potential sources of capital, and undermines the efficient delivery of financial services and the competitive position of our financial institutions in world markets. 
Mr. President, Congress' reform effort in the 105th Congress must be forward-looking, not merely a reengineering of the legacy and laws from the New Deal. Our reform effort must not be limited in its design by unfounded fears and outdated philosophies. The far-reaching changes we are witnessing require a top-to-bottom examination of long-standing conventions about the way our financial system should be structured and regulated as we approach the 21st century. Already, banks and competitors from outside the conventional banking system are jockeying for position and advantage as competition heats up for control of market share and customers in a world of electronic commerce. 
Existing institutions that fight for legislative restrictions to protect their markets are fighting the last war. Debate over financial modernization that focuses primarily on issues like the future of the banking franchise or gerrymandering markets through piecemeal legislation to protect a particular market segment is too narrow from a public policy standpoint. Such a narrow approach addresses questions and solves problems that existed in the 1970's and 1980's; however, the year 2000 is quickly approaching and the policy debate in Congress and among industry leaders should be oriented toward the future. Technology and new financial competitors from outside the traditional arena will now provide an important and new catalyst for meaningful change and long overdue comprehensive financial modernization. 
Mr. President, in its consideration of financial modernization, the new Congress will need to explore a number of new and important issues, including: 
Given all the technological changes and new players in the market, what does it mean to be a bank? Does it make sense to maintain an artificial distinction between banks and nonbanks? Does it make sense to preserve the fiction that banking and commerce are somehow separate? Does it make sense to prohibit information-driven firms from owning or affiliating with banks now that financial services are in large part information processing activities? 
How will the old system of deposit insurance fit into this environment? Should more complex institutions be required to give up deposit insurance, as was suggested by one of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents? 
How do we ensure that technology results in greater choice, lower fees and fair, readily available access by consumers? The experience we are having with ATM's raises questions about whether consumers will share in the benefits of technology or whether the benefits will go primarily to the owners of that technology. 
How can we protect individual privacy now that computers make it so easy to collect and disseminate personal information? This is such a sensitive concern that the Congress directed the Federal Reserve to conduct a study. 
I do not know the answers, but these are provocative questions which require careful study and debate. 
Others are studying these issues as well. 
Last year, Congress directed the Treasury Department to conduct a study of all issues relating to a common charter for all federally insured depository institutions as part of the law stabilizing and eventually merging the two Federal deposit insurance funds (BIF and SAIF) (P.L. 104-208). The Treasury Department is expected to submit that study next month. 
The Treasury Department appointed a consumer electronic payments task force which will include the principal Federal agencies involved in the payments system. 
In addition, the Treasury Department is completing a study on the strengths and weaknesses of our financial services system in meeting the needs of the system's users. 
Most recently, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan announced formation of a committee that will look at the Fed's role in the 
payments system of the future. 
Mr. President, I introduce the Depository Institution Affiliation Act as a prelude to a vigorous debate about the future of our financial system. Let me explain how the Depository Institution Affiliation Act [DIAA] will make the financial system safer, more stable, and more competitive. I will submit a more detailed section-by-section explanation of the bill at the end of my remarks. The bill is virtually identical to legislation that I have previously sponsored or cosponsored in 1987 (S. 1905) and in 1989 (S. 530). In the previous Congress, it was S. 337. With the exception of technical and conforming changes to reflect the enactment of banking laws since its original introduction, the text of the bill is unchanged. 
Mr. President, comprehensive financial modernization as proposed in this reform legislation would produce many beneficial changes for all financial intermediaries. 
First, the legislation will enable all financial intermediaries--commercial banks, investment banks, thrifts, and so forth--to attract financial capital and managerial expertise by eliminating existing restrictions on ownership by and affiliations among depository and nondepository firms. However, the DIAA preserves all the safety-and-soundness and conflict-of-interest protections of the present system, while providing legal flexibility for a company to meet the financial needs of consumers, businesses, and others. 
Mr. President, some detractors of DIAA describe it as too radical because it permits these affiliations. However, this type of common ownership is already allowed by our laws and has existed for decades without any evidence of problems. Federal law and public policy expressly allows commercial companies to own and affiliate with a variety of federally insured banks--for example, credit card banks, limited purpose banks, trust companies, and so forth--and savings and loans. For example, unitary thrift holding companies have proven that finance and commerce can be mixed safely. In fact, the lack of ownership restrictions on thrifts has worked to expand the capital and managerial talent available to thrifts. And the successful record of unitary holding companies demonstrates that broader ownership affiliations can actually strengthen depository institutions through greater diversification and financial strength. Moreover, the reality is that nonbank organizations, including telecommunications, cable companies, and software firms are designing and delivering banklike financial services and products over the Internet and World Wide Web without owning a bank. 
Second, this bill will facilitate diversification and assure fair competition by creating a new charter alternative for all companies interested in entering or diversifying in the financial services field--a financial services holding company--FSHC. These FSHC's will be authorized to engage in any financial activity through separately regulated affiliates of the holding company. The bill would permit the merging of banking and commerce under carefully regulated circumstances by allowing a FSHC to own both a depository institution and companies engaged in both financial and nonfinancial activities. 
Third, this legislation will insulate insured subsidiaries--for example, banks--from the more risky business activities of its affiliates, as well as the parent holding company. It would not authorize or allow these activities to be conducted in a bank's operating subsidiary. 
Mr. President, by authorizing this alternative regulatory framework, the legislation would essentially exempt a FSHC's subsidiaries and affiliates from those sections of the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company Acts that restrict mixing commercial banking with other financial--securities, investment banking, and so forth--and nonfinancial activities--retailing, technology, manufacturing. A FSHC would be able to diversify into any activity through affiliates of the holding company, with such affiliates subject to enhanced regulation. 
Fourth, this bill will enhance substantially the quality and effectiveness of regulation through functional regulation. The regulation of the bank and nonbank affiliates of financial services holding companies would be along functional lines. The insured bank affiliate would be regulated by Federal and State bank regulators, the securities affiliate by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and so on. Thus, for each affiliate, existing regulatory expertise and resources will be applied to protect consumers, investors, and taxpayers. Functional regulation will also assure that competition in discrete products and services is fair by eliminating advantages attributable to current loopholes, regulatory gaps, and cost subsidies. 
Finally, the bill would improve coordination and supervision of the overall financial system by permitting more effective analysis and monitoring of aggregate stability and vulnerability to severe disruptions and breakdown. 
By removing unnecessary barriers to competition between providers of financial service in the United States, this legislation will permit U.S. capital markets to maintain their preeminence, and will allow U.S. financial intermediaries to respond to growing competition from foreign companies. 
Mr. President, I want to underscore that the DIAA would not require existing firms to alter their regulatory structure. By permitting financial services providers to become FSHC's, such providers will have the option to phase gradually into, or expand within, the financial services industry. 
Mr. President, the DIAA provides a solid platform and a sound approach to modernizing our financial structure. I recognize that this bill can be improved, and I am specifically requesting constructive and helpful comments to improve and to refine the major principles underlying the bill. As the committee proceeds to hearings and further consideration of the bill, I intend to make changes and adjustments in order to ensure competitive fairness, promote safety and soundness; achieve depositor, investor, and consumer protection; and assure effective and efficient functional regulation. Modernization of the financial services industry should not include the preemption of State consumer protection laws. 
Mr. President, in the absence of congressional action, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board have acted to achieve limited modernization with results often of questionable legal authority and public policy results. Specifically, I am concerned about the OCC's action to permit a bank's operating subsidiaries to engage in activities that are not permissible for the bank. I believe this regulation is unwise. And I am deeply concerned that the Comptrollers action may subject federally insured banks to excessive risks and expose the bank insurance funds, and therefore taxpayers, to unnecessary liability. Congress can never forget the lessons of the savings and loan crisis in the late 
1980's. In addition, the Fed's recent actions to increase the aggregate level of business a section 20 securities affiliate may engage in and its proposal to reduce or even eliminate important firewalls and safeguards that have existed for over a decade are also imprudent. 
Mr. President, the rivalry between regulators to attempt unilaterally to set public policy and alter the competitive balance for their constituencies is not wholesome or helpful. The regulators actions will never be a substitute for comprehensive and balanced congressional action. For far too long, Congress has ceded the field to piecemeal deregulation by bank regulators and the courts. The time has come for Congress to decide on a legal and policy framework that prepares our financial institutions for the new century and the challenges of a rapidly changing global economy. The 105th Congress must address and resolve the important questions relating to the health and future of the banking industry in the broader context of a financial system that is increasingly composed of nonbank financial service providers. We must focus on the needs of our economy for credit and growth in the future and the next century. We must focus on financial stability, safety and soundness, fair competition, and functional regulation of all financial service providers--whether they are banks, investment banks, insurance companies, finance companies or even telecommunications or computer companies. 
Mr. President, the benchmark provisions, principles, and purposes of DIAA, as stated above, have been tested and explored over the years. During a decade of debate several studies, including a 1991 study by the Treasury Department entitled, `Modernizing the Financial System: Recommendations for Safer More Competitive Banks', these principles and the framework of the bill have become the centerpiece of an emerging consensus in favor of forward-looking, balanced and prudent approach to modernization. I am hopeful that a new study underway by the Treasury Department and due to be submitted to Congress in March related to a common bank and thrift charter will reach similar conclusions. 
Mr. President, by continuing to work together, as demonstrated by the BIF/SAIF bill last year, the Congress and the administration can overcome the complaints of vested interests and reform our antiquated financial services laws. We should not miss this opportunity for constructive bipartisanship. I believe that this bill provides a good starting point for the 105th Congress to act on financial modernization. Passage of this bill will be a high priority for the Banking Committee. I believe this is a realistic objective.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to do again something I have done many times in the past--to say good things about Sam Wise. Sam passed away during the early morning on Tuesday, January 21, 1997, after a short illness. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to his wife, Mary, and the rest of his family in this most difficult time. 
I first met Sam in 1981, when I came to the Senate as a freshman and joined the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is better known as the Helsinki Commission. I have worked with him, traveled with him, relied upon him, trusted him as a staff member, a diplomat, and a friend. 
When I first served as the Helsinki Commission's chairman, in 1985 and 1986, Sam was already the pillar of wisdom, the font of all Commission and CSCE knowledge, and the balance wheel of good judgment that kept things under control. At the Vienna CSCE Review Conference, which began under my chairmanship, Sam became the deputy head of the U.S. delegation, and was awarded the personal rank of Ambassador by the President. It was an honor hard-earned and richly deserved. 
With the start of the 105th Congress, the Commission is suddenly and sadly lacking Sam's leadership, professionalism, and gravitas. The obituary published in the Washington Post on Thursday, January 23, 1997, summarizes the facts of his life. But it doesn't tell the story of the arduous travel, the late nights, the haggling over bracketed text, the personal integrity and ex-marine toughness that made seasoned diplomats trust him and rely upon him and allowed him to close the deal when other people couldn't. 
The measure of his loss will test us. In life, he taught and led, and gave of himself unstintingly in the service of his country, and in the service of humanity. Retired from the Department of State in 1982, after serving with the Commission on detail since 1977, the year after the Commission's founding, he had his greatest impact on U.S. policy with the Commission. He subsequently served as the Commission's staff director, and later as its director of international policy. 
His skillful, steady hand helped guide the Helsinki Accords from a contentious and little-known artifact of detente to a living, growing international process and organization that has brought much good to many people, and has helped build peace, prosperity, and security for the United States, our allies, and all of the people of Europe. 
His work with the Commission specifically advanced the cause of human rights to its highest level of achievement in international relations. During the cold war, prisoners of conscience, refuseniks, persons whose families had been separated, the oppressed of all kinds, had a friend and a skillful ally in Sam. Many cases were resolved--among them those of Anatoly Scharansky and Yuri Orlov--and many families were reunited. We can make a list of individual people he helped, and every one of these cases in whose resolution he had a hand adds luster to his name. 
More importantly, in international meeting after international meeting, Sam did the hard work of diplomacy, out of the spotlight, helping bring together the United States, Canada, and the nations of Europe to agree, word by painfully negotiated word, on commitments that made human rights a legitimate issue in international relations, not one that an oppressive state could easily dismiss as outside interference in its internal affairs. 
This is hard work, building the foundation of human civilization. That's what Sam helped do. The modern Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and especially the established human rights standards it embodies and advances, are a product, in larger part than the world knows, of his dedication, skill, tireless effort, and commitment to principle. While the world at large may little note his passing, those of us who know the Helsinki process and the demanding work of establishing and protecting human rights, we know we have lost one of the people who count. His achievements in life will serve as a lasting tribute to him, and will continue to do good for his country, our friends, and humanity in general for many years to come. 
Nothing I can say, nothing anyone can do, can make up for his loss. We can all, however, take some comfort in his accomplishments in life, and rededicate ourselves to the service of our country and to the advancement of those causes we shared with him. 
Sam, I will miss you. God bless you and God speed you home to His care.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for bringing to the attention of the Senate and to the Nation as a whole, I think, a very serious situation. Because this portends the kind of thing that may take place, I think notice has to be served by those within the court itself. 
Clearly, this case goes well beyond the realm of someone having a difference of legal opinion. The question of jurisdiction alone is a frightening one and how someone could reach well beyond and entertain a matter--are we going to say any Federal judge in any Federal jurisdiction can review matters that do not legally come before them or within their purview or power?

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators Moseley-Braun, Abraham, Jeffords, Daschle, Lieberman, and Murray, in introducing legislation that will provide a new tax incentive to encourage the private sector to clean up thousands of contaminated, abandoned sites known as brownfields. Brownfield sites are abandoned or vacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of being environmentally contaminated. 
Under current law, the IRS has determined that costs incurred to clean up land and ground water are deductible as business expenses, as long as the costs are incurred by the same taxpayer that contaminated the land, and that taxpayer plans to use the land after the cleanup for the same purposes used prior to the cleanup. That means that new owners who wish to use land suspected of environmental contamination for a new purpose, would be precluded from deducting the costs of cleanup in the year incurred. They would only be allowed to capitalize the costs and depreciate them over time. Therefore, it is time for us to recognize the need for aggressive economic development policies for the future economic health of communities around the country, and to recognize the inequity of current tax law. My colleagues and I believe that our legislation is the type of initiative the Federal Government needs to encourage development of once abandoned, unproductive sites that will bring real economic benefits to urban distressed and rural areas across the United States. By encouraging redevelopment, jobs will be created, economic growth will continue, property values will increase as well as local tax revenues. 
Mr. President, I am proud to say that in my State of New York, the city of Elmira has been selected as a fourth round finalist for the EPA's Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative Demonstration Pilot Program. The city of Elmira has primed an unsightly and unsafe urban brownfield and is now in the final stages of turning it into a revenue- and jobs-producing venture. The city of Elmira initiated this important project with no guarantees of public or private funding and has done this at very minimal cost to taxpayers. Can you imagine what could and would be done if the public and private sector had the encouragement to also become involved? 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, I come here today and rise to introduce a bill that I think is unfortunately necessary, unfortunately because HMO's and insurance carriers--and I don't mean this for all, but we are seeing a growing tendency--are doing the kinds of things nobody would have imagined, and they are doing it and interfering with good, sound medical care, because they are more interested in the bottom line. 
Indeed, there are some who are already beginning to drumbeat against health maintenance organizations per se, and we would be losers, because there are important innovations and savings that can be made, but those savings and innovations should not be made at the expense of the traditional and important and sacred--sacred--right that a patient should have with their physician. 
Maybe it takes the specter of cancer and breast cancer, in particular, because people are concerned and it is a fright, to get people to focus on what is taking place, and that is insurance carriers placing arbitrary limits on patients as it relates to the length of stay or time that they can use a medical facility, a hospital. 
It is interesting and, indeed, ironic that as I make these remarks, the presiding officer who sits in the chair and presides over the Senate today is a distinguished Senator and a distinguished citizen who spent so much of his life in the area of healing and of practicing medicine and who knows better than I. I am so pleased to be able to have his counsel and to share these thoughts with him today personally. 
While I introduce this legislation on behalf of 16 colleagues in the Senate of the United States and 20-plus Representatives in the House, Democrats and Republicans--totally bipartisan--I do not suggest that this is the cure-all for what we see taking place. Indeed, we have specifically limited this legislative initiative. 
There were calls and outcries that HMO's and insurance carriers be required to provide at least a minimum of time as it relates to mastectomies. Many in the medical profession came forward and said, `We think that is the worst kind of legislation. We would rather see no time, nor do we think that the health providers should be setting times.' 
That is a larger debate for a larger area, but I subscribe to that, and I think that we should say very clearly here in the U.S. Senate and Congress, By gosh, insurance carriers should not be saying, `If there is a particular disease, we are only going to insure you up to X hours.' 
What happens if there is a complication? It may be that a procedure, whether it be a mastectomy or whether it be prostate cancer or whether it be some other disease, that ordinarily, under normal circumstances, there is an average length of time. It might be 1 day, 2 days, 3 days. But who is to say, if there is a complication and it takes 6 days or 2 weeks, are we then going to say something that ordinarily would be covered in insurance policies, that somehow because someone has adopted a rule--and why they have adopted that rule; I don't know how they can practice that, they are not practitioners--that we are going to exclude you if you go over that period of time? 
This is wrong. This should not be the way in which we attempt to manage health care costs, and it is, I believe, taken by many people to mean the greed of the industry. 
The fact that there are now today many in the HMO business, some almost startup companies overnight, making millions and millions of dollars--I am not against profits, but if you are going to make profits by denying adequate basic medical treatment, then that is wrong, that is immoral and we in the Congress of the United States have a business to do something about it. 
I know there are going to be those who say let the marketplace work, let free competition work. Well, that is naive. To simply say that by insisting on a minimum standard, that minimums be observed, that no one interferes with the patient and that very special relationship with the doctor--we are now seeing that taking place, because there are those carriers who are punishing doctors, punishing them by denying them adequate compensation or penalizing them by denying them moneys they otherwise would have because they recommend treatments that may cost that insurance carrier more but which they feel are necessary for the safety, health, and protection of their patients. 
How dare we permit and countenance that kind of thing today? We know it is going on, and to the health maintenance organizations and to the insurance carriers who say it is not going on and this legislation is not necessary, well, if it is not necessary, don't oppose it. It is that simple. If you are not penalizing doctors or rewarding them because they hold back on treatments that might cost more and which are necessary, then why should you be opposed to it? If you are not arbitrarily limiting the time that a patient may have or necessary treatments, then why would you be opposed to it? 
This legislation basically says you cannot do that, you cannot prescribe 48 hours as it relates to mastectomies. You cannot deny that doctor-patient relationship by penalizing a 
doctor. We say you are not permitted to do that, or rewarding a doctor on the basis of cost-effectiveness. 
In a third provision, we say that when it comes to the devastating disease and the specter of cancer, not only breast cancer, but prostate cancer--all cancers--that people are entitled to a second opinion. There is not anyone I know who, if they faced a diagnosis and were given a particular course of treatment that would be suggested, that they would not look for a second opinion. That is fact. 
If the doctor and the attending physician recommended a second opinion, our legislation says the company must pay for that. If that physician feels that there is a need to get some specialist outside of the organization, outside of that HMO, the company must pay for that. What do we say to the average worker who has no independent resources who can't pay $500 or $1,000, or whatever it might be for that specialist, for that second opinion? You cannot have it? 
So, Mr. President, we provide that with respect to this particular disease. I believe we should go further, and I think in the fullness of the discussions and the legislative actions that this Congress will undertake that we will examine this, and your committee, the Health Committee, in particular will be looking at it. 
But I think certainly at this time we should begin to say, Listen, as it relates to this particular disease of cancer, where the treating and attending physician recommends a second opinion, that patient should have the ability and the right to be covered and have that second opinion. 
I am going to relate two specific examples, because we have spent some time in shaping and putting together this legislation and it is by no ways written in stone or steel. It is in the sand, it is something to be looked at, something to be worked with. I look forward to the help and recommendations of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, who presides today, on how we can improve and make this legislative effort a better one. 
Last, but not least, in the area of breast cancer in particular, one of the very shattering thoughts and a fear that women live with today is the fact that they may be one of the eight who is diagnosed with breast cancer, and that is a national average. They are concerned about the treatment that might permanently disfigure them and, therefore, it becomes absolutely imperative that, as a nation, we indicate to people that there are courses of treatment that cannot only save a life but, indeed, do not have to be disfiguring, and in this way, as it relates to breast cancer in particular, have more women coming in for early diagnosis and treatment and avoid, No. 1, death, and, No. 2, disfigurement, because we provide that breast cancer reconstruction and that reconstructive surgery not be considered cosmetic. 
If someone loses an ear, that surgery is not considered cosmetic. However, incredibly, we find insurance carriers denying reconstruction on the basis that it is cosmetic. So we create a double tragedy by denying women who have that disease and who don't have the ability to pay for reconstruction the ability to have that. And, second, and probably just as important, there are many who will not go for early diagnosis, and, therefore, the treatment is not available to them until it is too late. That has to be avoided. 
So we provide that HMO's and insurance carriers must make this available. It is not an option that they can just simply turn away. 
The title of our bill is called the `Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997.' 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997. This important reform legislation will significantly change the way insurance companies provide coverage for women diagnosed with breast cancer. The problem of the so-called drive-through mastectomies must be eliminated from our society. Physicians must not be forced to have their best medical judgment questioned by insurance companies who put their bottom line before a woman's health. The women of New York and America deserve better. 
Today, there are 2.6 million women living with breast cancer. In 1997 alone, more than 184,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and, tragically, 44,000 women will die of this dreaded disease. Breast cancer is still the most common form of cancer in women; every 3 minutes another woman is diagnosed and every 11 minutes another woman dies of breast cancer. The D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe legislation makes critically important changes in how breast cancer patients receive medical care. 
Specifically, the bill requires health insurance companies to cover an unlimited stay in the hospital following mastectomies, lumpectomies, and lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer when the attending physician decides a longer stay is necessary. Every physician would have the freedom to prescribe longer stays when necessary, and the confidence that insurers will not punish them for practicing sound medical treatment. My bill would make it illegal to penalize a doctor for following good medical judgment. The time for a hospital stay will no longer be an arbitrary 
determination made on the basis of saving money. 
Another important provision of the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe bill ensures that mastectomy patients will have access to reconstructive surgery. Scores of women have been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure cosmetic and not medically necessary. It is absolutely unacceptable and wrong that many insurers deem this essential surgery as cosmetic, and it is a practice that must be changed. 
The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act also includes a unique provision for coverage of second opinions by specialists. The bill would require health care providers to pay for secondary consultations when cancer tests come back either negative or positive. This important provision will help identify false negatives as well as false positives. Additionally, if the attending physician recommends consultation by a specialist not covered by the health plan, the bill would allow the doctor to make such a referral at no additional cost to the patient. 
This legislation is particularly important for the women of Long Island. Our families have been ravaged by this horrible disease. Our grandmothers, mothers and daughters, sisters and wives, children and friends have been afflicted at rates that are unexplained and far too high. 
We must continue to work together to find a cure for breast cancer. But until a cure is found, we must ensure that women receive the treatment they deserve. This legislation protects women and anyone ever diagnosed with cancer. It is the most comprehensive bill introduced in the Senate and I am proud to offer it today. 
I want to thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe for the contributions that they have made as it relates to helping prepare this legislation. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act is important. It is important again that we preserve adequate, decent, affordable medical care and not tamper with that sacred relationship that should be preserved between a doctor and his patient. 
I would like, if I might, to share with the Senate the remarks of a great surgeon, Dr. Larry Norton, Chief of Breast Cancer Medicine at Sloan Kettering, one of the great cancer hospitals in this Nation. He is reflecting about a patient. I will not read all of it. He tells why, I think, this legislation is so necessary. He said:  
There was a patient that I saw on a second opinion not too long ago who paid herself for a second opinion because her HMO . . . wouldn't [do that]. I saw her and told her about a therapy that was very scientifically based that we thought was superior here, in fact clinical trials have demonstrated to be superior, and it has become a standard now, throughout the United States. . . . we offered her that particular treatment. 
Speaking to the person on the other end of the phone at her managed care plan, and I managed to work my way up to the physician level through several clerical levels. . . . 
Here is the chief of surgery at Sloan Kettering Memorial calling an HMO to suggest this course of treatment. I want to describe what is going on. He had to call clerk after clerk after clerk, and he finally got someone who was a physician. By the way, most people cannot do that and they cannot work through that. And he was told that they would not pay for the care. 
He went on to say--and this is the person on the other end: 
. . . Dr. Norton, we are not saying . . . 
Imagine, this is an HMO, a doctor on the other side of the HMO. He is saying: 
. . . Dr. Norton, we are not saying that [it] is not the right treatment, we are just saying that we are not going to pay for it. 
By the way, what I am reading to you is testimony he gave publicly about 10 days ago in New York at Sloan Memorial. He went on to say: 
I put the phone down, shaking, and called her [that is, his patient] to discuss this with her, and her 10-year-old son answered the phone. I said who I was and he said, calling to his mother, `Mommy, your doctor is on the phone.' I knew at that moment that the discussion that she could not get the care that was appropriate was not what I was going to say. Through enormous efforts, and through the support of my terrific institution, [we] were able to provide her that care and things turned out very well for her, as we could have anticipated. 
The doctor goes on to say: 
The point is that there is a holy alliance between the doctor and the patient, and the entire structure of medicine is because of that holy alliance. It is a religious experience [a religious experience] to take care of a patient well and, if you feel any less motivation, you are not [going to be] doing your job as a physician. We feel that kind of motivation here. We are living in an era where a lot of steps are coming between the doctors and the patients. Their motivations are not necessarily the same motivations that have driven us to this point of advance. 
What we see before us today . . . 
He talks about legislation and the fact that it was a bipartisan effort to protect that relationship, that special relationship that I know that the President understands well. 
Again, we are going to hear cries of intrusion, or about the marketplace. Well, since when do you tell me we do not have a right to set basic minimums? We do that in many areas. We do that as it relates to quality of food. We do that as it relates to protecting our drinking water. We certainly have a right to say you cannot interfere with that special relationship by punishing a doctor because he is giving what he feels is the proper medical advice and withholding from him and having him think that he may be penalized. That is wrong. That is wrong. 
Mr. President, I want to share another experience. When we initially talked about introducing this bill, we did not talk about breast cancer reconstruction. And I got a call from the executive director of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of New York, a remarkable woman by the name of Mary McCarthy. She said, `Senator, we've been making studies.' She was a person who brought to our attention, Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe, and others, the fact that there was this great problem of insurance carriers not providing for reconstructive surgery when it came to the breast and considering it as cosmetic. 
Let me just read to you her words which communicate the problem. Not only is she the executive director of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of New York, she goes on to say: 
I am a breast cancer patient myself. I would like to share [with you] my experiences on the three major subjects within the bill, the mastectomy surgery, the reconstructive surgery and the second opinion. 
She says: 
I thought I was very well informed on health care and I thought I had excellent health care coverage. Yet my own reconstructive surgery and my second opinion were both denied by my health care plan. My reconstruction was denied last April as not medically necessary. 
She went on to say she was able to eventually get this surgery. She said: 
I am concerned that other women do not have these kinds of resources. I would like to touch, although personal, on the importance of reconstructive surgery for women who opt to have reconstruction surgery. My mastectomy was clinically curative surgery, but my reconstruction was emotionally healing. There is no longer a reminder every day of my cancer. When I get dressed in the morning, in an intimate moment with my husband, if I have my nightgown on at home with my kids, I look normal and I feel normal. If you lose an ear or a testicle, or part of your face to cancer, there is no question that reconstruction is covered. Yet denials for breast [cancer] reconstruction are serious and they are rising. 
For a disease with the magnitude of cancer, it is very important to have access to second opinions and to be able to [go] outside your HMO, if necessary, for the kind of expertise you need. To my surprise, and to the surprise of my physicians within my plan, my plan adamantly refused to authorize my second opinion. I paid for my second opinion myself, not all women have these resources . . . No family should be forced to assume this kind of responsibility. 
Then she goes on to say something. 
When I was in the hospital after my surgery . . . [the nurses] actually cringed [the people responsible for taking care of me] and looked upset when they changed my dressing. I spoke candidly to my husband, who is loving and caring and goes with me to most of my medical appointments, and he felt that he could not have handled the emotional or the clinical responsibility of helping with drains and bandages. The appropriate length of stay is critically needed and the language in the bill to ensure that the appropriate stay for each individual is met is vital. 
What she is saying is that if she had been discharged, her husband could not have taken care of her. And you just simply cannot set a time limit. 
Mr. President, I want to offer that bill. I send it to the desk with the cosponsors. I commend all of my colleagues to join in this legislative effort. It is one that we will be serious and purposeful for. I hope we can have hearings sooner rather than later. 
Again, as I said, this is totally bipartisan in nature. Cancer does not look to see the politics of its victims. In particular, we address some of the major concerns as they relate to cancer. But I think problems that we have go well beyond this. This is something that this Congress should become involved in, the vital interest of the health of all of our citizens.

Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support a native New Yorker, a fellow New Yorker, Andrew Cuomo, to be Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee reported Mr. Cuomo's nomination yesterday by a unanimous vote. I am privileged to support the confirmation of a native New Yorker, particularly one who has done so much in the area of housing in such a relatively short period of time. I commend Mr. Cuomo for his record of public service, first as an advocate for the homeless, and second in terms of his stewardship as Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development at HUD. 
Since 1993, the Secretary has successfully presided over an annual budget of nearly $10 billion, encompassing a wide diversity of housing, community, and economic development programs. He has shown innovation, insight, and tireless efforts to serve our cities, suburbs and rural areas. He has done so in a way that has avoided partisanship with an eye toward giving to many of those who would otherwise not have the opportunity for good, safe, affordable housing. That is his record as it relates to the private sector in providing transitional housing for the homeless. 
It is not good enough, Mr. President, to simply say, `Let's build a shelter, temporary, for the homeless,' and bring them off the streets and leave them in a situation that during the day, or when the weather is not inclement, they go back out into the community and wander around aimlessly. We cannot then think the community has met its obligation, its moral and ethical responsibilities to those people--when we take them back in during inclement weather but again discharge them. 
Mr. Cuomo, as a young man in 1986, founded and served as president of Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, known as HELP. HELP is a provider of housing which uses a strategy to move homeless people from the streets to transitional housing with supportive services to deal with the number of problems that these families may have, like drug addiction and alcohol addiction. HELP was a model for his approach to homelessness that he utilized at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HELP is providing assistance for over 4,000 people each year. 
His grassroots background working in communities, not coming in opposition and thrusting a program upon the community, but working with the community and the private sector, has helped provide him with the insights that I think are so necessary in order for us not to have a department that looks down upon the cities and the States and the communities, but instead works with them in partnership. 
Mr. President, let me suggest the Department of Housing and Urban Development needs a lot of work. It needs to be improved. There are some very serious problems. Indeed, unless we address those problems we could face a very difficult situation with hundreds of thousands of people being in a position that they are unable to live in a decent place. We are now approaching a situation that has built up over the years. Our section 8 program's current renewal budget is something in the area of $3.4 billion. That is what we are going to spend to help people who live in this section 8 assisted housing pay for the differential in terms of what they can afford to pay and what the rent is established at. Mr. President, 38 percent are senior citizens. That budget need will rise this October from $3.4 billion to over $10 billion. 
The total HUD budget is only $20 billion. And we have an increase of approximately $7 billion. Where will that money come from? Are we going to increase? Is the administration and the Congress going to increase by $7 billion the HUD budget? I do not think so. 
This is going to take innovative leadership. It is going to take a husbanding and directing of resources in the way they should be directed to maximize our spending. I believe it will take a more enlightened approach by the administration and Congress to deal with the insufficiency of resources that HUD presently has. 
I do not think it is going to be an easy job to get additional resources given the fact that the inspector general has indicated that there are some very severe problems that exist at HUD. There are serious problems ahead that the new Secretary and the Congress are going to have to deal with. HUD faces a fiscal crisis. Hard choices are going to have to be made. 
This really calls upon all of us, including the Secretary under his leadership, to work together to ensure that our Nation's most needy, particularly our senior citizens, are not going to be jeopardized as a result of this fiscal crisis that we are facing. Again that crisis is going to be upon us sooner rather than later. It will be with us this coming October. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I again say that after a very thorough nomination hearing, and Mr. Cuomo meeting with just about every Banking Committee member, the committee unanimously voted for his confirmation. I look forward to a successful confirmation of Andrew Cuomo so that we can begin to work toward our mutual goals of improving access to housing in all of our Nation's communities. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to approve this confirmation, and I applaud the President for choosing Andrew Cuomo and designating him to be our next Secretary of HUD. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. DAMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the recent death of Garbriel Lewis Galindo, a noted statesman from Panama and friend of the United States of America. 
Gabriel Lewis is perhaps best known for his efforts to conclude the Panama Canal Treaty. As Panama's envoy to the United States on this issue he worked closely with the Carter administration to this end. In the process he gained the respect of many people in our Government. 
Mr. Lewis continually sought to restore democratic principles to Panama and used the Panamanian-United States negotiations regarding the canal to press Panama's dictator, Omar Torrijos, to move in a more democratic direction. Mr. Lewis' hard work was rewarded as Omar Torrijos eventually granted more freedom to the media and political parties in Panama. 
When Gen. Manuel Noriega rose to power in Panama 2 years after the death of Omar Torrijos, he undertook measures to reverse those democratic gains which had been achieved. Gabriel Lewis became an outspoken opponent of Manuel Noriega, a strategy which eventually forced him to leave Panama after he unsuccessfully sought Noriega's removal from power. 
Gabriel Lewis was both pragmatic and visionary. He understood the need for a close and productive relationship between the United States and Panama based on respect, dignity, and shared ideals of democracy. Mr. Lewis fought to make this happen. He will be missed.

Mr. DAMATO. 
Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices and Principles of Economic Justice Act of 1997. This amendment seeks to deter efforts to use the work place as an arena of discrimination in Northern Ireland. 
The Northern Ireland Fair Employment Practices and Principles of Economic Justice Act of 1997 incorporates the MacBride Principles, which are modeled after the famous Sullivan Principles, one of the initial efforts to apply United States pressure to change the system of apartheid in South Africa. The MacBride Principles are named in honor of the late Sean MacBride, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and co-founder of Amnesty International. 
This amendment will enlist the cooperation of United States companies active in Northern Ireland in the campaign to force the end of discrimination in the workplace by: 
First, eliminating religious discrimination in managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs and significantly increasing the representation in such jobs of individuals from under represented religious groups. 
Second, providing adequate security for the protection of minority employees at the workplace. 
Third, banning provocative sectarian and political emblems from the workplace. 
Fourth, publicly advertising all job openings and undertaking special recruitment efforts to attract applicants from under represented religious groups, and establishing procedures to identify and recruit minority individuals with potential for further advancement, including managerial programs. 
Fifth, establishing layoff, recall, and termination procedures which do not favor particular religious groupings. 
Sixth, abolishing job reservations, apprenticeship restrictions, and differential employment criteria which discriminate on the basis of religious or ethnic origin. 
Seventh, developing and expanding upon existing training and educational programs that will prepare substantial numbers of minority employees for managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical, and technical jobs. 
Eighth, appointing a senior management staff member to oversee the U.S. company's compliance with the principles described above. 
It is in the workplace in Northern Ireland, which can be used to eliminate discrimination, where improving the employment opportunities for the underprivileged will help factor out the economic causes of the current strife in Northern Ireland. This will hopefully begin the process toward a peaceful resolution of the so-called troubles.
